Mary Hagen is believed by town gossips to be the illegitimate daughter of Tom Bates, a former resident and lawyer. She is often treated badly. Bates moves back into town and begins a friendship with Hagens favorite teacher Julia Kane (Maxwell). There are hints that Bates is the real father of Hagen, though it is later revealed that she was an orphan adopted by the Hagens. When the teacher leaves town, she suggests to Bates that he stop playing Hagens father, as it has become clear that he is in love with her. The film ends with Bates and Hagen boarding a train, presumably to get married.
