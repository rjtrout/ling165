Danish miners Svend Viltorft dig up a section of a giant reptiles tail from the frozen grounds in Lapland, where they are drilling. The section is flown to the Danish Aquarium in Copenhagen, where it is preserved in a cold room for scientific study. But due to careless mishandling, the room is left open and the section begins to thaw, only for scientists to find that it is starting to regenerate. Professor Otto Martens, who is in charge of the Aquarium, dubs the reptilian species "Reptilicus" (upon a reporters suggestion) and compares its regeneration abilities to that of other animals like starfish. Once fully regenerated from the tail section, Reptilicus goes on an unstoppable rampage from the Danish countryside to the panic-stricken streets of Copenhagen (including one of its famous landmarks, Langebro Bridge). The monster is finally rendered unconscious by a sedative, developed by ingenious scientists, and shot into its mouth from a bazooka fired by Gen. Grayson. However, the film is left open-ended. A final shot shows Reptilicuss foot, which had been blown off earlier by the Danish Navys depth charges, sinking to the floor of the ocean, raising the possibility that it could regenerate into a new Reptilicus.
