Nicholas Urfe is a young Englishman who has taken a teaching position on the Greek island of Phraxos following the previous instructors suicide. For Nicholas it is a chance for different surroundings, and it is also an attempt to escape his relationship with his emotionally unstable lover, Anne. At first Nicholas life on Phraxos is uneventful but peaceful. He soon becomes intrigued with a reclusive man named Maurice Conchis, who owns an estate on the opposite side of the island and has a beautiful young woman named Lily as a companion. Immediately upon being introduced to the couple, Nicholas life begins to unravel. He tries to find out who the mysterious Conchis really is. Is he a psychiatrist? A film producer? A Nazi sympathiser? Or is he a magician who controls the lives and destinies of those around him? Nicholas quickly begins to lose his grip on reality as he sinks further and further into Conchiss game. During visits to Conchiss estate, Nicholas has a series of experiences which gradually become more unexpected and bizarre. Many are related to (or are re-enactments of) past events from Conchiss life. Ultimately, these events begin happening off the estate as well, at unexpected times and places, raising questions as to how much power and control Conchis can actually exercise over others lives. The story climaxes with a "trial" directed by Conchis with Nicholas (and many others) participating. The final scene (which may be interpreted almost as a coda) has to do with Nicholas relationship with Anne and whether or not it continues.
