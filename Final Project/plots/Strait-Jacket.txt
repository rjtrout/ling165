Lucy Harbin has spent 20 years in a psychiatric hospital for the decapitation axe-murder of her husband (Lee Majors) and his mistress, after catching him cheating on her. After she is released, she takes up residence at the farm of her brother Bill Cutler and sister-in-law Emily. Lucys adult daughter Carol, an artist and sculptor who was adopted by the Cutlers, also lives on the farm. She is seemingly unaffected by the grisly murders she had witnessed as a three-year-old child. Carol encourages her mother to dress and act the way she did in the past. Lucy begins playing the vamp and makes passes at her daughters fiance Michael Fields. She then shocks his parents with a sudden tantrum when they consider their sons marriage to Carol out of the question. A series of brutal axe-murders then begins, with Lucys doctor, who is found in the freezer, the first victim, followed by the shady hired man Leo. All signs point to Lucy as the murderer and some believe she is still insane, and should be returned to the hospital. The climax of the film reveals that the murders have actually been committed by Carol. She has gone to great lengths to make her mother appear to have returned to being a murderer by doing things to stoke Lucys anxieties. When Carol kills, she disguises herself as her mother, even wearing a mask she created to duplicate her mothers head and face. All this has been done in the hopes that somehow, with Michaels parents out of the way, she could marry the handsome, wealthy young man. As the film ends, Lucy calmly accepts her responsibility for her daughters illness and hatred and announces that she is going to visit Carol in the hospital where she is now confined.
