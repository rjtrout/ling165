Butch "Bullet" Stein (Mickey Rourke) is a 35-year-old Jewish ex-convict who is released from prison after serving a 8-year sentence for being an accomplice to a robbery. After his release, Bullet and his best friend Lester rob two teenagers for drugs. He returns to Brooklyn to live with his dysfunctional family, including his alcoholic father, depressed mother, unstable older brother Louis, and his younger brother Ruby, an aspiring artist. Tank (Tupac Shakur) is a local drug kingpin with a score to settle after Bullet stabbed him in the eye while they were serving time together. Bullet seems to welcome the challenge. In the meantime, he keeps himself occupied by shooting heroin and robbing his neighbors house for jewelry, which he sells to a gangster named "Frankie Eyelashes". He also encourages Ruby to follow his artistic dreams. After failing to kill Bullet with poisonous drugs, Tank gets his henchman to start a fight with Bullet. The fight ends in a draw when the henchman breaks his hand. Bullet briefly returns home where he tells his mother hes sorry for everything he put her through over the years. He then accepts his fate and has a final showdown with Tank, who shoots him dead to Rubys horror. Soon after, Louis gets revenge by cutting Tanks throat and leaving Bullets pet rat (named Tony Curtis) on the dead body.
