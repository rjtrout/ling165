A group of very different people live in a hotel in Los Angeles, California including the romantically involved Tom Tom (Davies) and Eloise (Milla Jovovich). The events that unfold are the result of the death of an important resident; the son (Tim Roth) of a billionaire media mogul. His father commissions an FBI agent (Gibson) to look into his death.
