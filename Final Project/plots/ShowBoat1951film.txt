The basic plot remains the same as in the stage play and the 1936 film version. When the Cotton Blossom, Capn Andy Hawkss show boat, arrives in a Mississippi town to give a performance, a fistfight breaks out between leading man Steve Baker (Robert Sterling) and Pete (Leif Erickson), the boats engineer who has been making passes at Steves wife, leading lady Julie La Verne (Ava Gardner). Capn Andy (Joe E. Brown) pretends to the assembled crowd that the two were really previewing a scene from one of the boats melodramas. But Pete knows a dark secret about Julie, and he runs off to tell the local sheriff. Riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal (Howard Keel) has gambled away a boat ticket, so he drops by the Cotton Blossom pretending to be an actor so that he can get passage on the boat, but is rejected. However, he meets Magnolia (Kathryn Grayson), the captains 18-year-old daughter, and the two are instantly smitten. That night, during the performance of an olio on the show boat, Pete shows up with the town sheriff (Regis Toomey). But when Julie and Steve hear that the sheriff is coming to arrest them, Steve takes a sewing pin, pricks Julies finger, and sucks blood from it. The Sheriff enters and announces that there is a case of miscegenation on board, a negro woman married to a white man, which is illegal. Julie is the woman, and Steve is the man. Julie admits that she is part negro, but Steve, having sucked some of Julies blood, tells a misleading truth by stating that he also has negro blood in him. Pete is fired by Capn Andy. However, Julie and Steve must still leave the acting companyâ€”blacks were not allowed onstage alongside whites in the South of the 1880s. After Magnolia, who is Julies best friend, tearfully says goodbye to her, she and Steve leave the company. Ravenal shows up and offers help. This time, Capn Andy takes him on, makes him the acting companys new leading man, and makes Magnolia the new leading lady, over the strong objections of his wife Parthy (Agnes Moorehead), who is also Magnolias mother. Within a matter of weeks, Magnolia and Ravenal are a hit on the river and have fallen in love. They become engaged, marry (in this version, the wedding celebration is not shown), and move to Chicago, where they live off Ravenals gambling winnings. A year passes and Ravenal loses all his money gambling. After he goes broke, Magnolia (unlike in the stage original and the 1936 film) tells him off for being so obsessed with gambling. Feeling guilty after Magnolias tirade, Ravenal walks out on her. Ellie Shipley and Frank Schultz (Marge and Gower Champion), the dance team on the show boat, suddenly show up in Chicago, having also left the boat and been booked into a nightclub called the Trocadero. They take Magnolia to audition there, but before she arrives, we see that the club already has a singer. It is Julie, who has become a hopeless alcoholic now that Steve has left her. From her dressing room, she overhears Magnolia audition, learns from the nightclub manager that Ravenal deserted her, and silently quits so that he will have no choice but to hire Magnolia. On the night of her debut, Capn Andy arrives to visit and ends up at the nightclub, where he gives Magnolia confidence after she experiences stage fright. Here, the plot changes drastically from the stage original and the 1936 film: Magnolia not only tells Capn Andy what has happened, but reveals that she is pregnant with Ravenals child. She did not have the heart to tell Ravenal because of their financial situation, and she returns to the show boat with Capn Andy, where she gives birth to a daughter, Kim. About five years pass. Ravenal is gambling on board a packet boat, on which a drunken Julie is trying to sing. After punching her escort because he slapped Julie, Ravenal goes out on deck. Julie, who has been keeping track of Magnolia, finds out who Ravenal is, and not realizing that he knew nothing of Magnolias pregnancy, tells him off. Ravenal is overcome with guilt and returns to the show boat the next day, where he meets his little daughter Kim (Sheila Clark) for the first time and returns to Magnolia, with whom he is reconciled. As Ravenal and Magnolia walk back onto the boat, the stevedore Joe begins his reprise of "Ol Man River" and Capn Andy and Parthy embrace. On the dock Julie emerges out of the shadows, and blows a kiss towards Magnolia as the ship sails to its next destination.
