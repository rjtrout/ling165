Tillie Winterbottom (Alison Skipworth) has just lost her waterfront saloon in Shanghai, China in a dice game, and her ex-husband Gus (W.C. Fields) is on trial for murder in Lone Gulch, Alaska, when they each receive word that Tillies brother has died. Gus escapes and the two reunite in Seattle, then head for Danville to investigate the dead mans estate and the possibility of an inheritance. Local Danville attorney Phineas Pratt (Clarence Wilson) claims the man died in debt, but he actually has swindled his daughter Mary Sheridan (Julie Bishop, billed under her real name, Jacqueline Wells) out of her rightful inheritance, including the family home, forcing her to move with her husband Tom Sheridan (Phillip Trent) and their infant son, King (Baby LeRoy) to a dilapidated ferry called the Fairy Queenâ€”supposedly the one item left of the estate. When Tillie and Gus arrive in Danville, they are mistaken for missionaries newly returned from Africa by their relatives. Tillie plans to sell the boat and split the profits, but they become suspicious when Pratt expresses an inordinate interest in acquiring the seemingly unseaworthy boat, and they decide to help Mary and Tom refurbish it. Pratt, who has just purchased his own boat, the Keystone, tries to eliminate the competition by convincing the state inspection board to deny the Sheridans a ferry franchise. It is decided that the outcome of a Fourth of July boat race will determine who is awarded the franchise. Comic mayhem ensues when Gus does everything in his power to sabotage their rival, ultimately coming out ahead in the end. Tom tells Gus, "That ferryboat race was the worlds biggest gamble," to which Gus replies, "Well, dont forget, Lady Godiva put everything she had on a horse!"
