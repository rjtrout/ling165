A clothing manufacturer, Hank (Robert Young) returns from a year in Japan, learning about a new formula for synthetic silk, to discover that his girlfriend Eleanor (Ann Sothern) is engaged to marry another man. Hank persuades her to jilt the new man at the altar. After he and Eleanor get married, Hank comes to dislike the show-business friends of his wife and mother-in-law Gypsy (Cora Witherspoon) who pop up at all hours. And a man named Dillman (Dean Jagger) turns up who claims that Eleanor is actually his legal wife, not Hanks. Hank is distracted by Vera (Maria Shelton), a friend of Eleanors, but in the end pretends to be a cab driver and steers his taxi into a lake, with passenger Eleanor wearing a silk dress Hank gave her that disintegrates in the water.
