When kind-hearted delivery boy and self-acclaimed authority on ancient Rome Eddie (Eddie Cantor) is thrown out of his home-town of West Rome, Oklahoma by scheming and corrupt politicians he protests that nothing of the sort would have been allowed to happen in ancient Rome. On his way out of town he imagines that he is back in Imperial Rome, where he is sold in a slave market to good-natured tribune Josephus (David Manners). Eddie soon discovers that Roman society was just as corrupt as in his own town and when he decides to do something about it he becomes involved in court intrigue and a murder plot against the evil Emperor Valerius (Edward Arnold) himself.
