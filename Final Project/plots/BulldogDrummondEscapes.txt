Captain Hugh Bulldog Drummond (Ray Milland) has just returned to England. As he is driving home in the dark, a young woman jumps out in front of his car. He misses Phyllis Clavering (Heather Angel), but she falls to the ground. As he tries to revive her, he hears a shout for help, then gunshots. As he goes to investigate, the woman drives away with Drummonds car. He is soon able to trace her to nearby Greystone Manor, and when he goes there to meet her, she urges him to help her get out of a desperate situation.
