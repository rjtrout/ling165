House Un-American Activities Committee investigators Jim McLain (John Wayne) and Mal Baxter (James Arness) come to Hawaii to track American Communist Party activities. They are interested in everything from insurance fraud to the sabotage of a U.S. naval vessel. After receiving useful information from reporter Phil Briggs (Vernon "Red" McQueen), the agents begin searching for Willie Nomaka, a former party treasurer, who has allegedly experienced a nervous breakdown and attends the clinic of psychiatrist Dr. Gelster (Gayne Whitman). The doctors secretary, Nancy Vallon (Nancy Olson), is helpful as well. McLain asks her on a date and a romance develops. Nomakas landlady, Madge (Veda Ann Borg), assists in the investigation, flirting with McLain. Nomakas ex-wife (Madame Soo Yong) also helps McLain. Nomaka is eventually found to be staying in a sanitorium, heavily drugged and unable to speak. Party leader Sturak (Alan Napier) gives orders to Dr. Gelster to get rid of him. Gelster also kills McLains partner Baxter, by mistake, when he succumbs to an injection of truth serum. As the investigators close in, Sturak attempts to make Gelster confess to his Party membership so the case can be closed and so others can continue their work. Their meeting is interrupted by McLain, who instigates a brawl. Police arrive to place Party leaders under arrest, but ultimately he and Nancy Vallon see them plead the Fifth Amendment and go free.
