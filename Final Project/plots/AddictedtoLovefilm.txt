Two pairs of lovers play out a comedy of errors, in which Maggie (Ryan) and Sam (Broderick), try several unethical and nasty tricks to break apart the envied union of their respective former partners, Anton (Karyo) and Linda (Preston) including identity theft, assault, and destroying Antons restaurant. Obsessive astronomer Sam is devastated when the love of his life, Linda, cheats on him and leaves him for a suave Frenchman named Anton. He therefore goes to New York to stalk her and sets up house (and a camera obscura) in the abandoned building opposite Lindas, intent on winning her back and waiting until she decides to leave her current lover. What Sam does not count on is being joined several weeks later by Maggie, a photographer and motorcyclist, who is determined to get revenge on Anton, her ex-fiance. Mutually hostile at first, the two of them eventually join forces in an attempt to separate the couple and ruin Antons life. However, complications ensue when Sam and Maggie start falling for each other.
