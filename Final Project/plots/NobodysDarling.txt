Husband-and-wife acting team Curtis and Eve Farnsworth have a daughter, Janie, who attends a very exclusive boarding school. Janie is frustrated because her parents pay more attention to acting than to her and because Chuck Grant, in charge of the schools upcoming musical production, tells Janie she cant act, cant dance and isnt glamorous enough to be in the show. Janie eventually becomes aware that her fathers career is flourishing but her mothers is not. Rather than accept roles opposite a younger co-star, Curtis decides to retire without telling his wife why. Janie, meanwhile, ignored by her parents but encouraged by principal Miss Pennington, turns out to be a very good singer, so now Chuck does want her to perform. Confusion reigns when word is falsely spread that Janie and Chuck are also romantically involved. Their angry parents come to the school to withdraw them. Pennington persuades them to wait until the show, and when they finally see how talented Janie is, everybody ends up happy.
