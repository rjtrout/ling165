Rob Gordon is a self-confessed music loving everyman with a poor understanding of women. He is dumped by his latest girlfriend, Laura, and attempts to understand what is the failure in his relationships by seeking out old partners. By day, he holds court at his record store, Championship Vinyl, where customers drift through. His helping hands, especially with musical elitism, are Dick and Barry, the "musical moron twins". Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile "top five" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers and sell a few records. Two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince and Justin are bothers to them until Rob listens to a recording that they made as The Kinky Wizards. He offers them a record deal to start off his own label called Top 5 Records. During his off hours, he pines for Laura and does his best to win her back. Rob soon hears that Lauras father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with her. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he has always had one foot out-of-the-door and never committed to her. He realizes by doing so he has neglected his own future. They resume cohabitation. He meets a music columnist and a crush develops, but then he wonders while making a mixtape for her, if he will always just be jumping from rock to rock. He explains to her how other girls are just fantasies, Laura is a reality, and he never tires of her. He proposes marriage; she thanks him for asking. She organizes for him to revisit a love of his youth: dee-jaying. It is also a celebration of the recently released single by the two delinquents, where Barrys band plays "Lets Get It On". Surprised that Barrys band is not a disaster, Rob holds Laura, and they both sway to the music. Rob makes a mixtape for Laura, feeling that he has finally learned how to make her happy.
