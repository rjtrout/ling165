The story takes place in England two centuries after the Norman Conquest (about 1300ce). Saxon scholar Walter of Gurnie is the illegitimate son of the Earl of Lessford and has been dispossessed of his inheritance by his fathers Norman widow. After joining a group of Saxons who free hostages held by Lessford, Walter is forced into exile when he is recognized. Walter flees England, accompanied by his friend Tristram Griffen, a Saxon archer, and sets out to make his fortune in Cathay during the times of Pax Mongolica. Walter seeks the patronage of Mongol warlord General Bayan of the Hundred Eyes and agrees to fight for him. The "Black Rose" of the title is the beauteous Maryam, a half-English, half-Mongol girl who has escaped from the harem Bayan is escorting to China. Disguised as a servant boy, she travels with Walter and Tristram in the caravan. Maryam loves Walter but he is too interested in his adventure to pay her any attention. Tristram doesnt like all the killing and decides to get away. He takes Maryam with him, because she wants to go to England. Bayan sends Walter on a mission to see the Yuan Empress of China. When he arrives he is told that he must stay in China as their guest for the rest of his life. Then he finds Tristram and Maryam were also captured and imprisoned. During this time, Walter realizes he loves Maryam. The three of them decide to escape. Tristram dies. The small boat in which Maryam is waiting for Walter in drifts away before Walter can catch her. Walter returns to England alone. Walter is welcomed back by the Norman King Edward because of all the cultural and scientific knowledge (including gunpowder) he has brought back from China. The king knights Walter and grants him a coat of arms. Two Mongol emissaries from Bayan show up. They have brought The Black Rose to England to join Walter there.
