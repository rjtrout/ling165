Former World War I ace pilot Captain Bob Dayton, (Donald Woods) is the owner of Sky Raiders, Inc., an aircraft factory. He has designed a new high speed fighter aircraft, the Sky Raider and bombsight. Nazi agent Felix Lynx (Eduardo Ciannelli) attempts to steal these designs for his own country. Dayton recruits young Tim Bryant (Billy Halop), a member of Air Youth of America, to help him. Attempts to steal the fighter prototype fail. The new bombsight is being tested in Hawaii, and Lynx intercepts a Boeing 314 Clipper on the way to Honolulu. After it is shot down, Bob and his secretary Mary Blake (Kathryn Adams) were rescued by a government cutter. Lieutenant Carry (Robert Armstrong) and Tim meet the survivors but find that Lynx has sent his henchmen to finish the job. The foreign agents are killed when they hit an oncoming truck. Mary announces that she has become Mrs. Dayton.
