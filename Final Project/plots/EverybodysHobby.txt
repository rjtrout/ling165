Tom Leslie is having some trouble at his newspaper job, so his wife, a stamp collector, suggests he distract himself with a former hobby of his own, photography. Tom takes his son Robert to a national park, where the boy, a short-wave radio enthusiast, enjoys his hobby, too. A park ranger informs the Leslies that a pyromaniac is on the loose and to be careful. Soon they and others are threatened by a roaring blaze, but Roberts radio enables them to send for life-saving help, while a photo Tom takes of the fire ends up capturing the pyromaniac in the same frame.
