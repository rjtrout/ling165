An Australian man named Ted (Clive Turner), intricately connected to the previous three Howling films, arrives in a small western town where he begins to mingle with the local townsfolk, secretly recording his own enigmatic agendas into a tape recorder in his hotel room. At the same time a number of mysterious slayings appearing to be the work of a large animal begin to occur in the area. A detective (John Ramsden) investigates the case, helped by a priest (John Huff) who is certain the killings are the work of a werewolf, leading the two of them to uncover several clues that connect events from the previous three films in the series.
