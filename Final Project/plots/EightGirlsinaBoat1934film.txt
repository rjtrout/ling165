While attending a girls school in Switzerland, young Christa Storm discovers she is expecting a baby. Student David wants to marry her, but he is poor and Christas father objects to him as a suitable spouse. Christa contemplates suicide by poison and even enjoys a final night out with friends before having a change of heart. Others from the rowing team, including the coach, are unaware of Christas plight. To punish her, the coach at one point makes Christa do strenuous dives and strokes in the water until she nearly collapses. All turns out well for her in the end.
