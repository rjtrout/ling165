A woman, Roslyn Wright (played by the uncredited Barbara Woodell), is found dead hanging from a chandelier in a posh mansion occupied by Victor Grandison, a popular "true crime" radio story host. Roslyn was his secretary. Victor also recently lost a niece, Matilda Frazier, presumed dead from a boating accident. But at a birthday party thrown by another niece, Althea, everyone is surprised by the appearance of Steven Howard, who claims to be married to the missing Matilda. Victor is accompanied by his radio producer, Jane Moynihan, at the party. He is unsure what to make of the stranger, particularly with a family estate to be settled, and asks a detective named Donovan to investigate. Matilda turns up, but claims to have no memory of Steven or their marriage, despite his efforts to prove it to be true. Acting suspiciously, meanwhile, is Altheas husband Oliver, drinking heavily. In time, Althea comes to believe her uncle Victor killed his secretary. Victor confirms this to Althea, then murders her as well. Steven confides to Matilda and Jane that he was actually Roslyns husband, determined to discover the truth about her death. Police forces get involved with several car chases, and when proof is found as to what really happened, police converge on Victor as he gives a symbolic confession on his radio show.
