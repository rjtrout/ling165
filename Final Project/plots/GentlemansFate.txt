They are both in the liquor business prohibition era. On his deathbed the father gives Jack an emerald necklace. Jack gives it to his fiancé. It turns out that the necklace was stolen. Frank does not want his fathers name to be put in the dirt, so he forces his kid brother to admit that he stole the nacklace. So he does. His fiancé Marjorie Channing breaks off the engagement and travels to England. Jack decides to join the family business. He kills the member of a rival mob, and its leader wants revenge by killing Jack.
