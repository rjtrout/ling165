Sir Alfred de Carter (Rex Harrison) is a world-famous symphony conductor who returns from a visit to his native England and discovers that his rich and boring brother-in-law, August Henshler (Rudy Vallée), has misunderstood Alfreds casual instruction to watch over his much younger wife Daphne (Linda Darnell) while he was away, and instead hired a detective named Sweeney (Edgar Kennedy) to follow her. Alfred is livid, and ineptly attempts to destroy any evidence of the detectives report. Eventually, despite his efforts, he learns the content of the report directly from Sweeney: while he was gone, his wife was spied late at night going to the hotel room of Alfreds secretary, Anthony Windborn (Kurt Kreuger), a man closer in age to her own, where she stayed for thirty-eight minutes. Distressed by the news, Alfred quarrels with Daphne before proceeding to his concert, where he conducts three distinct pieces of romantic-era music, envisioning revenge scenarios appropriate to each one: a complicated "perfect crime" scenario in which he murders his wife and frames Windborn (to the Overture to Rossinis Semiramide), nobly accepting the situation and giving Daphne a generous check and his blessing (to the Prelude to Wagners Tannhäuser), and a game of Russian roulette with a blubbering Windborn, that ends in de Carters Suicide (to Tchaikovskys Francesca da Rimini.) After the concert, Alfred tries to stage his fantasy of murdering his wife, but is thwarted by his own ineptness, making a mess of their apartment in the process. When Daphne returns home, he realizes that she really loves him, and learns that she is innocent of Sweeneys charges: she had gone to Windborns room in search of her sister Barbara (Barbara Lawrence), Augusts wife, who was having an affair with Windborn, and became trapped there when she saw Sweeney spying on the room. Alfred begs Daphnes forgiveness for his irrational behavior, which she gladly gives, ascribing it to the creative temperament of a great artist.
