A white supremacist group is chasing Lou Ann (Bernadette Peters), whose no-good husband Roy (Timothy Carhart) is a member. She has inadvertently taken counterfeit money from them by running away with his car (the pink Cadillac), which held the supremacists stash. Tommy Nowak (Clint Eastwood) is a "skip-tracer" (bounty hunter) whose speciality is dressing up in disguises, such as a rodeo clown, to fool whomever he is after. Tommy takes on the job of finding Lou Ann because she skipped bail. When he finally finds her in Reno, Nevada, Tommy slowly becomes enamored. Roy and his gang kidnap their baby, whom Lou Ann has left with her sister (Frances Fisher), so Tommy decides to help Lou Ann get the baby back instead of turning her in. While driving through the West, seeking the baby, romance blossoms. They eventually fight the evil supremacists and retrieve the baby.
