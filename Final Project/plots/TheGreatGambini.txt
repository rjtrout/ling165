Grant Naylor is unhappy because the woman he loves, Ann Randall, wants to instead marry Stephen Danby, a scoundrel. All are surprised during a performance of The Great Gambini when the magician predicts Ann and Danby will never be wed. His prediction comes true when Danbys dead body is found. Sgt. Kirby questions all of Anns family and Grant, and a piece of evidence points them to a man who was using a disguise. Grant believes the detective has the wrong man and discovers its been Gambini himself all along. Gambini confesses on stage, but remains confident because Kirbys handcuffs might not be able to hold him.
