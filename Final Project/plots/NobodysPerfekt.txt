Three therapy patients — Dibley (Gabe Kaplan), whose memory often fails him; Swaboda (Alex Karras), who believes that his late mother is still alive and living with him; and Walter (Robert Klein), who has three personalities — want the city to buy them a new car after theirs is totaled by a pothole. Legal means prove to be insufficient, so the three of them hatch a plan to extort the money from the mayor (Arthur Rosenberg). The tagline is, "You dont have to be crazy to fight the army, the mayor, longshoremen, short lawmen, and City Hall... But it helps."
