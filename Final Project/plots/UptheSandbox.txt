Margaret Reynolds, a young wife and mother, severely bored with her day-to-day life in New York City and neglected by her husband (David Selby), slowly slips into depression, finding refuge in her outrageous fantasies: her mother breaking into her apartment, an explorers demonstration of tribal fertility music at a party causing strange transformations, and joining terrorists to plant explosives in the Statue of Liberty.
