Jake Stein (Frankie Muniz) is a 17-year-old who lives with his sick mother and grandfather in Brooklyn. He wants nothing more than to be a writer, but when his mother’s health takes a turn for the worse, Jake is sent to Miami to live with his father, “Zowie” (Harvey Keitel), a small-time “handicapper” who gives horse racing tips for a living. Not much of a parent, Zowie has shirked his fatherly responsibilities for most of his son’s life. Nonetheless, Jake is excited about the prospects of bonding with his father in sunny Miami. Jake quickly befriends Mark, a local rich kid, whose excessive drug use helps him get through the pressures of teenage life in Southern Florida, where the "in" crowd only cares about how much money ones parents make, who’s coming to ones pool party, and whether or not one is getting laid. As Jake tries to navigate the waters of his new home—while trying to connect with his eccentric father—he meets Marina (Amber Valletta), a famous model who is in town for a photo shoot; the two quickly bond. Jake reminds Marina of her younger brother, who died in a motorcycle accident, and Jake is unable to get over the fact that such a beautiful woman is interested in him. But just when things seem to be going right, all goes terribly wrong. Jake must figure out how to become a man, if he is ever going to finish writing his memoir.
