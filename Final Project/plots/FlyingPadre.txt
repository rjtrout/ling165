The subject of Flying Padre is a Catholic priest in rural New Mexico, Father Fred Stadtmueller. Because his 4000-square mile parish is so large, he uses a Piper Cub airplane (named the Spirit of St. Joseph) to travel from one isolated settlement to another. The film shows him providing spiritual guidance, saying a funeral Mass, and serving as an impromptu air ambulance by flying a sick child and his mother to hospital.
