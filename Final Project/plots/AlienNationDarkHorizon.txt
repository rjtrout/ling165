In a recapitulation of the series cliffhanger, Alien Nation: Dark Horizon begins with Susan Francisco and her daughter Emily falling victim to a newly developed viral infection that was created by a group of human Purists to exterminate the Newcomer species. There is also a new sub-plot running parallel to this one, the story of Ahpossno, a Tenctonese Overseer who lands on Earth to find any surviving Tenctonese and bring them back into slavery. The idea of a signal sent into space by the surviving Overseers was explored in the Alien Nation episode Contact. (The series episode ended with contaminated flowers being delivered to the Francisco family and Cathy informing Matt that they have been hospitalised. However Dark Horizon seems to retcon the end of the previous episode by having similar events taking place at the beginning of the episode which seems to be set 4 years later.
