Bernice (Lisa Gay Hamilton) is a tough, no-nonsense parole officer whose son has gone missing. Fontayne (Yolonda Ross) is her old high school buddy whose brush with a possible parole violation lands her case on Bernices desk. When Bernice discovers that her son is a possible murder suspect, she enlists Fontayne in a quest to rescue her son from what turns out to be Drug Lords and a Chinese Snakehead. Before they cross the border into Tijuana and Mexicali, Bernice also enlists the help of Freddy Suarez (Edward James Olmos), a disgraced myopic ex-cop, whose nickname used to be "The Terminator". As the story unfolds, Mahershala Ali, Isaiah Washington and Harold Perrineau each deliver brief but plot-twisting cameos.
