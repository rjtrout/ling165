After saving a rancher from hanging, cowboy Mike "Utah" Blaine learns that his enemy Rink Witter is now a hired gun working for wealthy Russ Nevers, who is out to own every piece of land in the territory. Utah teams up with Angie Kinyon, another murdered landowners daughter, and rancher Mary Blake to maintain lawful ownership of their properties. He has a fistfight with Gus Ortmann, a large and popular fellow in town who misunderstands Utahs purpose. Witter then pulls a gun, but Utahs old pal Rip Coker shoots it from his hand. Marys cattle are stampeded and Gus is killed trying to protect her. The townspeople rally to Utahs side so that, when Nevers and Witter confront him, dozens of guns end up aimed at them. Utah ends up with a ranch of his own and with Angie as well.
