Annie Rooney (Shirley Temple), the 14-year-old daughter of a struggling salesman, falls in love with rich, 16-year-old Marty White (Dickie Moore). While at first Martys snobbish friends give Annie the cold shoulder, her jitterbug dancing skills impress, and soon she is a welcome addition to their circle. Martys wealthy mother and father, who own a rubber-making business, are not as easily persuaded of Annies worth. But when her father manages to invent a new form of synthetic rubber, her triumph is complete.
