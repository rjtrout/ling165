Softball player Ann Casey is tired of wearing athletic clothing and seeking something more glamorous, so she answers a newspaper ad seeking models at a photography studio. A reporter, Jimmy Jones, distracts her while in line and inadvertently costs Ann the job. While she returns to playing softball, Jimmy thinks there might be a story in the team. He finds its owner is a gangster, Foy Harris, then stumbles into a diabolical murder plot involving Foy being disguised as a woman on the team. Foy first kills his partner, then, because she knows too much, murders player Sue Collins by poisoning the laces of her catchers mitt. Ann ends up hiding in Foys closet, in danger of her life, then used as a hostage before Jimmy arrives to save her, just in time.
