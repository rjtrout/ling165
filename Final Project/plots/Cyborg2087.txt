Garth A7 (Michael Rennie), a cyborg from the future world of 2087, travels back in time to 1966 to prevent Professor Sigmund Marx (Eduard Franz) from revealing his new discovery, an idea that will make mind control possible and create a tyranny in Garths time. He is pursued by two "Tracers" (also cyborgs) out to stop him. Garth enlists the help of Dr. Sharon Mason (Karen Steele), Marxs assistant. He gets her to summon her friend, medical doctor Zeller (Warren Stevens) to operate on him to remove a homing device used by the Tracers to track him. The local sheriff (Wendell Corey) also becomes involved. Garth defeats the Tracers and convinces Professor Marx to keep his discovery secret. Then, with his future wiped out as a result, Garth ceases to exist; the people who helped him do not even remember him. It is "which came first, the chicken or the egg?" plot twist, so common with time travel films, which ignore paradoxes in favor of plot. If the hero does change history, and ceases to exist as history is reqritten, then he will not be there in the future to go back and make the change, supporting the scientific rule that the past cannot be altered.
