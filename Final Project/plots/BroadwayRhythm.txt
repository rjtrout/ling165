Murphy plays a successful Broadway musical comedy producer named Johnnie Demming. He needs a star for his new show. He’s smitten with the glamorous film star, Helen Hoyt (Simms), and offers the part to her, but she turns him down because she wants to be sure she’s in a hit. Johnnie’s father (Winninger), retired from vaudeville, wants to do his own show. He gets his daughter, Patsy (DeHaven) and also Helen. Johnnie feels betrayed by his father. The film is very loosely based on the Broadway musical Very Warm for May (1939). However, all the songs from the musical except for "All the Things You Are" were left out of the film. Some of the songs from the movie are by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II: All the Things You Are That Lucky Fellow In Other Words, Seventeen All in Fun
