Dagwood Bumstead has been caught possessing illegal fireworks and now he tries to make up for this by taking his wife Blondie to Aunt Hannahs ranch for 4 July celebrations. The ranch is a peaceful place in the country, but trouble starts already on the way over there, when the Bumsteads board the wrong train and have to hitchhike most of the way. The young couple that picks them up, Millie and Charlie, are on their way to get married and elope together, without their parents consents. The Bumsteads have to accompany the young couple to court and the wedding ceremony, but the wedding is interrupted by Millies father, Mr Tucker, storming in with a shotgun. Mr Tucker then takes the car, with Dagwood, his son and their dog still in it, and drives off. Charlie is forced to take Blondie to Aunt Hannahs ranch, and in she encourages him to have another go at marrying Millie and elop. unfortunately he twists his ankle on the way, and a very reluctant Dagwood has to take his place and go and fetch Millie from her (and her fathers) home. Dagwood accidentally climbs through the window to Millies fathers bedroom, and is held at gunpoint. He flees head over heels and is chased around the property. His son discovers what he thinks is some kind of fireworks and lights it, but it is in fact a dynamite stick. When the dynamite explodes it rips up a hole in the ground, and in doing so, opens up an oil well. Millies father is so happy over the new source of income that he consents to Charlie marrying his daughter after all, and the Bumsteads finish their weekend holiday at the hospital, in peace and quiet.
