After 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen has a nervous breakdown and overdoses, she is checked into a psychiatric hospital, Claymoore. On the ward, she befriends Polly, a childlike schizophrenic, Georgina, a pathological liar, and Daisy, who self-harms and has obsessive-compulsive disorder. She is drawn to sociopath Lisa, who is rebellious but charismatic, and encourages Susanna to stop taking her medication and resist therapy. Lisa has been at Claymoore for years, and knows how to manipulate its staff. She convinces Susanna to escape with her, and they run away to Daisys home. Daisy has been recently released and is living in a house provided by her adoring father. After Lisa taunts Daisy for the sexual abuse she suffers from her father, Susanna finds Daisy dead the next morning from an apparent suicide with her wrists slit and she hanged herself. Susanna is appalled when Lisa searches Daisys room and body for cash. Realizing she does not want to become like Lisa, she phones for an ambulance and returns to Claymoore. Susanna works on her painting and writing, and cooperates with her therapy. Before she is released, Lisa is returned to Claymoore. She steals Susannas diary and reads it for the amusement of the patients, turning them against Susanna. After reading an entry in which Susanna feels sympathy for Lisa being a cold, dark person, Lisa attacks Susanna, who runs. After Susanna confronts her, Lisa breaks down and tries to commit suicide, but the patients talk her out of it. Before Susanna is released the next day, she goes to see Lisa. Susanna reflects that she will remember Claymoore forever.
