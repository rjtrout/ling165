Margaret Drew (Crawford) runs her trucking company single-mindedly, if not ruthlessly. The only thorn in her side is writer Michael Holmes (Douglas) who is writing a book on some of her tough ways. With no time for men, the effect an attractive stranger has on her at her sisters wedding is unnerving. When it turns out this is the hated writer, she starts seriously to lose her bearings.
