In a small Southern town, Jim Price is elected sheriff over John Little, the incumbent. Racial tensions exist in the community, and Price gets little assistance from Little, leaving office, or from Mayor Parks, who insists he be consulted on any decision the new sheriff makes. A white man, John Braddock, is arrested on a manslaughter charge after his drunken driving causes the death of a young girl. Braddocks father carries considerable influence and demands his son be freed. Prices deputy, Bradford Wilkes, is beaten by Littles former deputy, Bengy Springer. Another arrest is made, this time of a black man, George Harley, accused of rape. The townspeoples mood turns uglier by the minute, particularly when Braddocks father threatens to spring his son by force if necessary. Littles conscience gets the better of him. He agrees to become Prices new deputy. Together, they try in vain to persuade other men in town to side with them against Braddocks vigilantes and to convince the mayor to call in the National Guard for help. Alone against the mob, Price and Little form a barricade and prepare for the worst when their fellow townsmen suddenly join them in the street.
