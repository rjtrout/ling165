Out sailing one day, J. Aubrey Piper saves a man from drowning. He overhears an impressed Amy Fishers remark and looks her up in New Jersey, irritating her family with his constant bragging but winning Amy, who marries him. A humble railroad clerk, Aubrey keeps pretending to be a more important man. He spends lavishly, piling up so much debt that he and Amy must move in with her parents. He gets fired by his boss Preston for making a wild offer on a piece of land, overstepping his authority by far. Amy is fed up and intends to leave him. Aubrey runs into her brother Joe, an inventor whose rust-prevention idea has received a firm offer of $5,000. Aubrey goes to the firm and demands Joe get $100,000 plus a 50% ownership interest. The company rescinds its offer entirely. Everybodys fed up with Aubrey, but suddenly Joe rushes home to say the companys changed its mind, offering him $50,000 plus 20%. And the railroad property paid off, too, so Aubreys offered his old job back, with a raise. He knows how lucky hes been and that he should just shut up, but he just cant.
