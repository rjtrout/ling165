A rising Hollywood starlet (Hudson) becomes "marooned" in a small desert town while on a roadtrip with her father. There, she gets to know the towns rather eccentric residents, including one (Ricci) whose hobby is pipe bombs and another (Sexton) who is trying to carry out his fathers dream of building a waterpark in the desert.
