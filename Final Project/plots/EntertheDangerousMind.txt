Hes constantly harangued by his roommate Jake (Thomas Dekker), who views Jim as a loser and wants him to do more than just hang around the apartment all day. Its through his work at a womens shelter that he meets Wendy (Nikki Reed) and the two initially begin to form a connection as they both share a love of dubstep and because Wendy recognizes that they share a lot of the same issues in life. This relationship proves to be short lived after Jim prematurely ejaculates during a date. Jake is sure that Wendy will only spread the story around and ruin Jims life by holding him up as an object of ridicule. With few other options Jim begins to take more and more of Jakes advice, which sets him on a far darker path than he could have expected.
