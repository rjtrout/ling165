Wealthy and charitable Mary Herries (Aline MacMahon) is tricked by aspiring artist Henry Abbott (Basil Rathbone) into letting him and ill wife Ada (Justine Chase) stay in her stately home. When he invites friends Mr. and Mrs. Edwards (Dudley Digges and Eily Malyon) to pay a visit, they overstay their welcome as well. Days turn into weeks, making Mary and housemaid Rose (Nola Luxford) increasingly anxious for everyone to leave. It turns out to be a plot masterminded by the silky and sinister Abbott to steal everything Mary owns. He masquerades as a relative and they as her butler and maid, holding Mary and Rose captive in their rooms. Outsiders are told that Mary has gone on holiday to America and wont return for a long time. The plot thickens as Rose is killed. The suspicions of Marys business adviser, Foster (Donald Meek), are confirmed when no record of Mary applying for a passport can be found. The police arrive just in time to save her and place Abbott under arrest.
