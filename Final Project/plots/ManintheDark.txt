Steve Rawley is serving a 10-year prison sentence from a Christmas Eve factory robbery that netted $130,000. He is offered an immediate parole if willing to undergo an experimental procedure by Dr. Marsden, a brain surgeon. Steve is released, but the operation leaves him with amnesia. He takes another name and believes he lost his memory in a car crash. An insurance investigator, Jawald, trying to find the missing robbery money, is convinced Steve is faking. Lefty, Arnie and Cookie, members of his old gang, kidnap Steve and demand to know where the loot is. Steve claims not to know or recognize any of them or Peg, who is said to be his girlfriend. Steve tries to phone for help but is beaten by his captors. Peg begins to believe he is telling the truth about the amnesia. She flees with Steve to an amusement park, a place that Steve keeps seeing in his dreams. He finds a box containing the money. Atop a roller coaster, he fights Lefty, who falls to his death. Arnie is shot by police, who have been summoned by Jawald. By handing over the box of money, Steve hopes that he and Peg will be able to be together and live a normal life.
