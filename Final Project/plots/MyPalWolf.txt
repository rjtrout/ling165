A young girl, Gretchen, finds an AWOL army German Shepherd dog and befriends it, naming it Wolf. When she takes it home, her strict governess notifies the Army who comes around to claim it. Wolf escapes from the army training camp and finds his way back to Gretchen. She and her friends go to Washington to see if the Secretary of War will give her the dog, to no avail. But in the end she gets a puppy to replace Wolf.
