[On-screen text: "Salem, Mass. 1800"] Fur trapper Jason Starbuck (Jeff Chandler) arrives in Salem. A general store owner challenges him to a horse race, but his riders fiancee, Roxana Reil, gives a helpful tip to Starbuck on how to win the race. A romantic attraction develops and Roxanas father advises her not to marry a man she doesnt love. Roxana sets sail for France, however, and her boat is attacked by pirates, who kill her father and take Roxana captive in Morocco, making her a slave. Starbuck pursues her. He is introduced by a U.S. consul to the sultan, who is impressed with Starbucks rifle marksmanship. He is offered a position with the sultans infantry and given a slave of his own, Lilith. Roxana has been sold to Omar Id-Din, who could be plotting against the sultan. Starbuck challenges Omar to a duel, with the winner acquiring the others rifle and slave. Starbuck wins and intends to return home with Roxana, but they are betrayed by the jealous Lilith, who fights Roxana and tells Omar of their plans. Starbuck is taken prisoner. Lilith has a change of heart, however, and changes clothes with Roxana to fool the guards. With the help of Hassan Sendar, one of the sultans soldiers, they help rescue Starbuck, who leads the escape of other prisoners. He throws Omar from a roof. He and Roxana are free, and, as a reward, Hassan is given a new slave, Lilith. Jeff Chandler recorded the song I Should Care on Brunswick Records from the film.
