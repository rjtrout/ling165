Kyle Watson is a talented basketball player who is about to graduate from high school. While he waits to find out if he will receive a scholarship to Georgetown University, he finds himself in a difficult dilemma over a playground basketball tournament. He must decide whether to play for and follow his widely beloved basketball coach Mike Rollins, or Birdie, a local thug in the neighborhood. Thomas "Shep" Sheppard, a former standout player himself, now works as a high school security guard. Kyle feels resentment towards the security guard, because Kyles own mother is falling in love with Shep. Coincidentally, Kyles coach also wants Shep to coach his team when he feels it is time for him to retire. It is later revealed to Kyle that Shep is Birdies older brother. Kyle makes a decision to run with Birdies team until he decided to come back to his old team, because of Birdies wrongful actions against Flip and Kyles friend Bugaloo. In the tournament, both Kyles and Birdies teams march to the finals, with Kyles team playing solid team basketball, while Birdies team plays a very thuggish style. Before the finals, Birdie threatens Kyle, demanding Kyle to throw away the game, so that Birdies team would win. Kyle is brutalized throughout the game, with Birdies team having a solid lead, and is injured. Shep, unable to watch anylonger, replaces Kyle in the game - despite being aggressively attacked throughout, Shep helps the team come back, and in the final seconds, passes the ball to Kyle, who hits the game winner. After the loss, Birdie orders Motaw, his star player and gang member, to kill Kyle. Shep protects Kyle and is shot, while Motaw is shot dead by security. Birdie is later killed by Bugaloo as revenge for previous humiliations. In the end, Kyle is revealed to have gotten the scholarship to Georgetown University - during a televised game, Kyle hits the game winner, while a recovered Shep watches with a smile.
