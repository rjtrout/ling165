A young woman comes to a small rural town to serve as secretary for a blind woman, the towns wealthiest person. The town is awash in mystery owing to the inexplicable deaths of local ranchers cattle. The young woman becomes entangled in a web of horror as she discovers that her employer, aided by the hideously deformed household servant, have used the blood of her predecessors to create a death serum when it is mixed with spider venom - and that her own blood is now being harvested at night, while she is in a drugged sleep, to continue the experiment.
