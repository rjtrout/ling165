Confederate veteran OMeara (Steiger) refuses to accept defeat following the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox. He renounces his family and the United States, travels west and joins the Native American Sioux tribe, and takes a wife (Sara Montiel). When the US Army builds a fort on Sioux lands and fighting breaks out between the Army and the Sioux, OMeara must make a difficult decision.
