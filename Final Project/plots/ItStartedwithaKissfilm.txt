After a whirlwind courtship, an Air Force staff sergeant who is a Korean War veteran, Joe Fitzpatrick (Glenn Ford), and his wife Maggie (Debbie Reynolds), a dancer, try to make their marriage work. Joe is posted to Spain; back in New York, his wife learns that he has won a raffle making them the owners of the custom-built 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car. The car is delivered to Spain, where it attracts attention from many people including a famous matador. The car also comes to the attention of Joes commanding officer, who insists he ship it back to the States to avoid promoting the image of Americans as snobbishly wealthy. This upsets Maggie. In the end, Joe sells the car to the matador and he and Maggie are reconciled.
