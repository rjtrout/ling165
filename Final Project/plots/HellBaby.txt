An expectant couple move into a haunted fixer-upper in New Orleans. There, they encounter a neighbour named Fresnel who tells them about the bloody history of their house. Vanessa (Leslie Bibb) and her husband, Jack (Rob Corddry), exhibiting a certain carelessness in their house hunting, buy a foreboding wreck of a place in New Orleans that the local residents have given demonic nicknames like "House of Blood". Vanessa is already extremely pregnant when they move in, and soon she is talking like the kid in The Exorcist. The Vatican sends some ghost hunters (Mr. Lennon and Mr. Garant).
