Millionaire animal lover and overall spoiled rich girl Trudy (Rene Russo) adds Buddy, a gorilla, to her family. Buddy finds life in the city very difficult to deal with. Although Trudy raises him as her own son in her mansion (which also houses a few comical chimpanzees, a kitten, a horse, a cheeky talking green parrot, her prize-winning champion pack of Briards, a raccoon and a flock of geese), he becomes hard to control due to his strength. A particularly bad experience in the Chicago Worlds Fair makes things even harder for Buddy. After he goes on an aggressive rampage and nearly destroys Trudys home, Buddy is taken to an ape sanctuary to live among his own kind in peace.
