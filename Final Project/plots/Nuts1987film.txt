When call girl Claudia Draper kills client Allen Green in self-defense, her mother Rose and stepfather Arthur attempt to have her declared mentally incompetent by Dr. Herbert Morrison in order to avoid a public scandal. Claudia knows that, if her parents succeed, she will be remanded to a mental institution indefinitely, so she is determined to prove she is sane enough to stand trial. The attorney her parents hire to defend her quits after Claudia assaults him, so the court appoints public defender Aaron Levinsky to handle her case. She resists him as well until she finally accepts that he is on her side. Aaron begins to probe her background to determine how the child of supposedly model upper-middle-class parents could find herself in this situation, and with each piece of her past, he uncovers he receives additional disturbing insight into what brought Claudia to this crossroads in her life. He discovers that she was sexually abused frequently by her stepfather as a young girl. In the end, the judge decides she is competent to stand trial and she leaves the courtroom on her own recognizance while she awaits her trial. The movie ends with information stating Claudia stood trial for first-degree manslaughter, with Aaron as her attorney, and she was acquitted.
