Having loved and trained horses since she was a little girl, Jane Drake is devastated when her dad Dr. Tim Drakes farm is sold to Dean MacArdle, who also intends to abandon the longtime tradition of harness racing to bring in "bangtails" to race. Dean is kind enough to sell Jane her favorite trotter, Yankee Doodle, for just $5. While she and her dad Doc Drake nurse that horse back to health, she persuades Dean to enter Doodles old stablemate, Yankee Clipper, in the upcoming "Hiatoga Stakes," hoping to change his mind about harness racing. Jane is disappointed when Deans snobby sweetheart Cornelia Hunt shows up. She decides to enter Yankee Doodle in the same race out of spite, but after Yankee Clipper wins instead, Dean demonstrates to Jane once more that his hearts in the right place.
