Arkansas, November 1973 - Frank (Michael Ray Davis) and his grandson, D (Thor Wahlestedt) go on an afternoon hunt. Just before dusk, the two hunters wander into the darkening woods to track down their kill and, to their horror, find that instead of a deer, they’ve shot their trespassing neighbor, Marion Mitchell (Thomas Moore). With a history of land disputes with the Mitchells fresh on Frank’s mind, he assures the boy that the only option is to hide the body deep in the woods. As the night draws on, Frank and the boy find themselves only deeper in darkness. Soon the lines between good and evil are no longer clear, and D begins to question if all will really be okay, come morning. According to an article in @Urban Magazine, the story of Come Morning is completely fictional but was partially inspired by Sims boyhood hunting trips with his grandfather.
