Soldier Jack Spade (Keenan Ivory Wayans) returns home to Any Ghetto, U.S.A. after receiving news that his brother, Junebug, died of an “OG” – an overdosing on gold chains. Surveying the old neighborhood, Jack observes the effect of gold chains on his community and desires revenge not only for his brother’s death, but for the community at large. He vows to destroy Mr. Big (John Vernon), the neighborhood chain lord responsible for the epidemic that claimed Junebug’s life. Jack asks for the aid of his childhood idol and local hero John Slade (Bernie Casey) in planning the demise of Mr. Big’s empire. Together, they form a team including Kung Fu Joe (Steve James), Flyguy (Antonio Fargas), Slammer (Jim Brown), and Hammer (Isaac Hayes). With the help of his crew, Jack sets out to take down Mr. Big and the gold trade in his streets.
