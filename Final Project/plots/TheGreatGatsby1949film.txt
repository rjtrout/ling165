A mysterious figure, Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties at his Long Island Sound estate, asks neighbor Nick Carraway to arrange a private tea with Nicks cousin, Daisy Buchanan. It turns out Gatsby loved her before going off to war. Now a wealthy man, Gatsby wants her back, but Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan and has a daughter now. She is unhappy, however, and is aware her husband has been having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, wife of a gas stations owner. Daisy seems to welcome Gatsbys attentions. They socialize with her friend, Jordan Baker, and Nick in the city. Daisy drives off with Gatsby, taking the wheel of the car, and hits Myrtle in the street, killing her. Wilson believes at first that his wife was deliberately killed by Tom, but Gatsby takes the blame for the accident. He is shot by Wilson while in the pool of his mansion, and only Jordan and Nick attend his funeral.
