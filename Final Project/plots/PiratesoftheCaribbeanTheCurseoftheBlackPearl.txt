While sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica, Governor Weatherby Swann, his daughter Elizabeth, and Lieutenant James Norrington encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck, and keeps it in order to protect him. Eight years later, Norrington is promoted to Commodore and proposes to Elizabeth, but her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea which "activates" the medallion. Captain Jack Sparrow comes to Port Royal to commandeer a ship, and rescues Elizabeth. Norrington identifies Jack, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith and swordsman. They duel, and Jack is captured and imprisoned. That night, the Black Pearl attacks Port Royal in search of the medallion. The crew of the Black Pearl capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa when she requests parley. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner to conceal her identity as the governors daughter. Barbossa takes her prisoner, believing her to be the daughter of "Bootstrap" Bill Turner. Elizabeth learns that her medallion is one of 882 gold pieces that Barbossas crew stole from Isla de Muerta, for which they were forced to bear the curse of undeath; they appear as decomposed corpses under moonlight. To lift the curse, they need to return all pieces with the blood of the owner of each piece, with Elizabeths being the final piece. Will frees Jack to rescue Elizabeth, whom Will loves. Jack, the original captain of the Black Pearl before Barbossa staged a mutiny, assists Will to reclaim his ship. The two commandeer the HMS Interceptor and head for Tortuga to recruit a crew; en route, Jack reveals that Wills father, Bootstrap Bill, was a pirate who was thrown overboard for opposing the mutiny against Jack. At Isla de Muerta, Will and Jack witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeths blood and the final gold piece. The curse is not lifted because the medallion belonged to Bootstrap Bill, making Will the owner by bloodline. Will rescues Elizabeth and brings her to the Interceptor, while Jack is captured by Barbossa and gets locked in the brig of the Black Pearl. The Pearl pursues the Interceptor, taking the crew hostage and destroying the ship. Will makes a deal with Barbossa to release Elizabeth in exchange for his blood, but Barbossa exploits a loophole in the agreement, marooning Jack and Elizabeth on a nearby island. Elizabeth makes a smoke signal, and Norrington brings the HMS Dauntless to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack. Elizabeth asks Norrington to return for Will, convincing him by accepting Norringtons marriage proposal. That night, the Dauntless arrives at Isla de Muerta. Jack plans to lure the pirates out to be ambushed by the crew of the Dauntless, but the plan goes awry when Barbossas crew walks underwater to attack Dauntless. Elizabeth escapes the Dauntless and frees Jacks crew from the Pearl. They refuse to rescue Jack and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own while Jacks crew takes the Pearl and flees. Jack reaches a deal with Barbossa to operate a pirate fleet, but suddenly frees Will and duels Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossas crew. Barbossa stabs Jack, but the latter is revealed to be under the curse, having taken a piece of gold from Cortezs chest. Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will drops both coins into the chest, with his and Jacks blood on them. The curse is lifted, causing Barbossa to die from Jacks gunshot; the rest of Barbossas crew, realizing that they are no longer immortal, surrender and are arrested. At Port Royal, Jack is led to the gallows to be hanged for piracy. Elizabeth diverts Norringtons attention and Will attempts a rescue, but Will and Jack are surrounded and held at gunpoint. Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will, leaving Norrington crestfallen. Jack dives into the sea and escapes aboard the Black Pearl, which is waiting nearby. Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him. Norrington permits Jack and the Pearl "one days head start" before initiating pursuit. In a post-credits scene, Barbossas pet monkey "Jack" steals a piece of gold from the chest and regains immortality.
