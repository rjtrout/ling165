David Jameson lives in a rural town in Maryland. He is forced to flee after he is suspected of murdering Beth Beebe, who tried to force him to marry her although he was engaged to another woman, Daphne Turner. He flees from town and takes on a new identity as George Bishop, marries Jane Meadows, and gets a comfortable job. Years later a skeleton is found on the Jameson farm. Believed to be the remains of Jameson, Beths brother, Clyde Beebe, is charged with the murder and sentenced to die. David returns to his home town in an attempt to exonerate Clyde.
