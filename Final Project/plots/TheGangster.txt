Shubunka is a racketeer, at odds with Cornell, a rival. Shubunka has a girlfriend, Nancy Starr, a showgirl, and offers protection to a New York beachfront cafe owned by Nick Jammey. A regular customer, Karty, has gambling debts and has stolen money from his brothers-in-laws garage. He begs Shubunka for help but is refused. Dorothy, the cafes cashier, quits her job, disillusioned by Shubunkas involvement in the rackets and concern for no one but himself. Cornell wants to take over Shubunkas rackets. Jammey gives him inside information on Shubunkas organization. After a couple of Cornells men beat him up on a picnic, Shubunka angrily accuses Nancy of having him set up. Karty has disappeared, meantime, but when his frantic wife appeals to Shubunka for help, he again infuriates Dorothy by saying no. Karty gets into a fight with Jammey at the cafe and accidentally kills him with a skillet. Cornell mistakenly believes Shubunka to be responsible and goes after him. This time Nancy does betray Shubunka, having been bribed with a Broadway stage offer by Cornell. Shubunka runs to Dorothy for help, but she declines, calling it just deserts for his unwillingness to help anyone else. With nowhere to hide, Shubunka is killed by Cornell in the street, just before the police arrive to place Cornell under arrest.
