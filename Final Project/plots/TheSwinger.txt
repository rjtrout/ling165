Kelly Olsson is an aspiring writer, but Girl-Lure magazine keeps rejecting her racy submissions. Kelly decides to show the magazine boys what theyre missing. She creates a fake identity for herself, pretending that a story about a young womans wild ways is actually about herself. Girl-Lures lecherous editor, Sir Hubert, and his suave editor, Ric Colby, like the concept but arent sure they trust the facts. Kelly tries to fool them by staging an orgy in her apartment building, asking friendly tenants to go along with her scheme. Sgt. Hooker of the vice squad doesnt feel she is fooling, however, and places Kelly under arrest. Ric comes to her rescue. But when her hoax is revealed, he decides to get revenge by insisting that Kelly pose for a provocative layout for the magazine to prove shes as wild as she claims. By the time his car and her motorcycle meet head-on in the end, theyre in love.
