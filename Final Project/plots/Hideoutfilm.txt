A couple of thieves, Beecham and Evans, rob a Chicago socialites diamond necklace. They give it to the man theyre working for, Arthur Burdette, who promptly double-crosses them. A diamond expert who examines the necklace is then found dead. Burdette slips away to a small Iowa town under an assumed name. When he hears city attorney George Browning has fired secretary Hannah Kelly, he offers Hannah a job. Browning has no idea that Burdette and Hannah are actually accomplices in crime, and pays no heed when new secretary Edie Hanson suggests that possibility. Betrayed crooks Beecham and Evans show up, looking for Burdette and the necklace. Browning doesnt realize how involved Hannah is until she shoots the two thieves and ends up having the stolen necklace on her. Edie helps him get the better of Hannah and Burdette, also making Browning realize hes falling for the new girl.
