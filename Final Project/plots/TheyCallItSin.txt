Small-town church organist Marion Cullen (Young) falls in love with traveling salesman Jimmy Decker. When she learns that the couple who raised her are not really her parents, and that she is actually the illegitimate daughter of a showgirl, she sets out for New York City in search of Jimmy. However, she discovers that he is engaged to Enid Hollister, his bosss daughter. Dr. Travers, who is in love with Marion, offers to help her out, but she decides to try to make it on her own. Jobs are scarce, however. She ends up with other hopeful showgirls, among them Dixie Dare, hoping to audition for a part in Ford Humphries new production. The philandering Humphries likes what he sees in Marion, and hires her as a piano accompanist. Dixie gets a job as well, and she and Marion become friends and roommates. Travers sees Humphries and Marion together, and knowing the formers reputation, brings Jimmy to Humphries party. Jimmy tells Marion that he loves her, but she refuses to break up his marriage. When she also refuses Humphries advances, he fires her, but decides to use one of the songs she has composed in his production, claiming he wrote it himself. When she finds out, she confronts him, but he denies everything. Jimmy goes to Humphries suite to try to convince him to do the right thing. During their argument, Humphries stumbles and falls onto the balcony below and ends up in a coma. Jimmy flees the scene, but the police have a description of him and suspect him of attempted murder. To shield Jimmy, Marion confesses to the non-existent crime. Desperate, Travers operates on Humphries for hours; Humphries regains consciousness and explains what really happened in front of witnesses before dying. Marion is released, and becomes engaged to Travers.
