The film revolves around four friends, all young men going nowhere with their lives. Tom and Johnny have dead-end jobs (one works as a telemarketer and aspires to be an actor, the other is a supermarket clerk), while Willie and Fernando (who prefers the name "Vinny") are unemployed and use people to get what they want. They go for a "guys night" out on the town from the Bronx to Manhattan, and fall victim to various disasters, (Tom wrecks his car, Willie gets the guys thrown out of a party, etc.) most of which they bring on themselves. During their "night out", their relationships with one another become strained as the various situations lead to conflict between them, and by the end of the movie they have all separated.
