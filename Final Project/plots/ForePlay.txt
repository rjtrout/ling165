The film is split into three segments: the first involves a man buying an animate sex doll and his many failed attempts to bed it. In the second story, a man suffering from writers block finds his muse by undressing various women. Finally, the third story involves the President of the United States, whose daughter is kidnapped and will be killed unless the President and his wife have sex on national television.
