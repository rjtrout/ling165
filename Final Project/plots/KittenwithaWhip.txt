The wife of politician David Stratton (John Forsythe) is away in San Francisco, visiting relatives there. Stratton comes home one night but not to an empty houseâ€”a young woman, Jody (Ann-Margret), is waiting inside. Jody tells him a tale of woe, so David offers to help. But the truth is, she has just busted out of a juvenile detention home, where she stabbed a matron and started a fire. And she is far from alone, because two young men suddenly materialize to torment David, who is afraid of a public scandal that could end his career. If he tries to get away and contact the cops, Jody threatens to accuse David of rape. The young men and Jody enjoy a wild party, but also begin to quarrel until one is cut with a razor. They drive across the Mexico border, taking David along. Jody and David elude them and end up in a Tijuana motel. When the punks return, a chase occurs and their car crashes, killing both of the young men. Jody, too, ends up at deaths door, but absolves David of any blame before dying. David is seriously injured in the accident and is hospitalized as the movie comes to an end.
