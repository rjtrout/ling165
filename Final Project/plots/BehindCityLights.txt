Small-town girl Jean Lowell is about to wed farmer Ben Coleman, but secretly longs for big-city lights and a more exciting life. A car crash outside the church causes a commotion, and the injured party, a New Yorker by the name of Lance Marlow, is instantly smitten with Jean. The wedding is called off after Ben senses that Jean is distracted. Lance and his partner Perry Borden continue on to New York City, and before long Jean convinces herself that she should follow. She finds the men and goes with them to a nightclub, where Perry makes fun of her small-town ways and, unbeknownst to her, steals a valuable necklace. Lance and Perry are thieves. Lance intends to quit so that he and Jean can begin a new life, but she takes a gift from him to a jeweler and discovers it is stolen. Things go from bad to worse when Lance is killed. A distraught Jean takes a job working at a diner, but regains happiness when Ben turns up and invites her to return where she belongs.
