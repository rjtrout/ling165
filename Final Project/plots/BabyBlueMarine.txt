Marion (Jan-Michael Vincent), a Marine recruit during World War II is kicked out of the Corps and sent home in a blue fatigue uniform. As recruits sent their civilian clothes home or sold them, the Corps did not wish less than honorably discharged Marine recruits to wear a uniform they had not earned. In real life, the Marine Corps issued light blue uniforms used by Flying Cadets prior to Pearl Harbor; hence the name "Baby Blue Marine" for a failed recruit. Marion meets a Marine Raider (Richard Gere in his second big screen appearance) a young, battle-scarred war hero back from the Pacific who has aged beyond his years with prematurely gray hair. As the Raider doesnt wish to return to the war, he knocks out Marion and trades uniforms with him. Marion enters an idyllic small town where the decorations and Raider shoulder-sleeve insignia of his uniform make him a hero to the community whose own young men are away at the war.
