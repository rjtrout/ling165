The plot of the film is largely unchanged from that of Shakespeares original play. Differences include the modern-day setting, switching Conrades gender, eliminating several minor roles and consolidating others into Leonatos aide, and expanding Ursulas role by giving her a number of Margarets scenes. In addition, the film attempts to add background to the relationship between Beatrice and Benedick by showing, in an opening scene, a morning after they apparently slept together. Benedick steals away quietly while Beatrice pretends to be asleep.
