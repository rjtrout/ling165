Wealthy socialite Tom Collier (Dennis Morgan) is bored by his fathers aspirations for him and by his elitist crowd, except for old friend Pat Regan (Jack Carson), who serves as his butler. When Tom meets commercial photographers Christie Sage (Ann Sheridan) and Frankie Connors (Jane Wyman), he purchases a failing liberal activist magazine in order to work with Christie and be near her. Tom begins to find himself among Christies bohemian friends, although his father does not approve. Christie eventually refuses Toms proposal of marriage and leaves for Mexico to pursue her photography as a fine artist. During her absence, the rebounding Tom marries gold-digging and manipulative Cecelia Henry (Alexis Smith), who plans to mold him to her own wishes. Christie returns from Mexico, realizing that she has made a mistake and that she loves Tom, but its too late. Cecelia schemes to separate Tom from Christie, from his old friend Pat, from his magazine work, and finally- conspiring with Toms father- from his principles. Tom must decide whether to publish an expos√© on corrupt defense contractors which will compromise many of his rich friends. With Pats help, Tom decides to move forward with the story and leave Cecelia for his real wife, Christie.
