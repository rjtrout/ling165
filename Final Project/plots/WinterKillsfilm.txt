Nick Kegan (Bridges) is the son of world-famous tycoon Pa Kegan (Huston) and the younger half-brother of the late U.S. President Timothy Kegan, who was slain by a lone sniper 19 years earlier. When an ex-convict named Arthur Fletcher (Joe Spinell) makes a deathbed confession to Nick, claiming that he was the second of two riflemen who shot the president and was sub-contracted by an unknown agency, Nick sets off on a quest to discover the truth about his late brothers murder. Nicks search takes him from the scene of the crime in Philadelphia, to New York, to California, and Washington, D.C. to uncover the conspiracy about President Kegans murder. During his epic quest, Nick meets people connected to President Kegan who include the billionaire war-games fanatic Dawson (Hayden), a mob boss known only as Gameboy (Meeker), shady nightclub owner Joe Diamond (Wallach), a Cuban mafia kingpin named Frank Mayo (Tomas Milian), eccentric computer developer John Cerruti (Perkins), and a notorious Washington madam named Lola Comante (played by Elizabeth Taylor in an uncredited cameo). As the list of suspects takes Nick deeper into his late half-brothers life and political secrets, all of the people he meets end up being murdered by unknown killers, while a mysterious woman on a bicycle always seems to be around at the time of the killings. Pa Kegan tries to get Nick to stop his investigation before he, too, becomes a fatality. The ending of the film is ambiguous, leaving it unclear whether President Kegan was killed by his father or the fathers then-assistant, John Cerruti.
