After being court-martialed and discharged from the Navy, Captain Bell (Rock Hudson) turns to drink. Reduced to skippering a rundown brigantine in the South Seas he takes on board a disparate group of passengers and crew; including a prostitute, a show-biz entrepreneur, a missionary, a washed up opera singer, and a couple of refugees. During a storm at sea, the true characters of all on board are revealed.
