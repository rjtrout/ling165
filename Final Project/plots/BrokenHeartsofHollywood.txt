Virginia Perry leaves her husband and child to return to Hollywood; but having dissipated her beauty and seeking solace in drink, she soon finds herself another "has been" on the fringe of movie circles. Her daughter, Betty Anne, wins a national beauty contest, and en route to Hollywood she meets Hal, another contest winner; both fail in their first screen attempts and turn to Marshall, an unscrupulous trickster, who enrolls them in his acting school. Molly, a movie extra, induces Betty Anne to attend a wild party; she is arrested in a raid; and Hal, to raise the money for her bail, takes a "stunt" job in which he is badly hurt. Betty Anne seeks the aid of star actor McLain, who obtains for her the leading female role in his next film; Virginia, who is cast as her mother, keeps silent about their relationship until the film is completed. Apprehensive for her daughters safety, she shoots Marshall while in a drunken stupor and is arrested. At the trial, Betty Annes testimony saves her mother, who is then happily united with her daughter and Hal.
