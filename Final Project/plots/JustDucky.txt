A mother duck sees all but one of her eggs hatch into ducklings and takes them for a swim, but Quacker then hatches from the final egg and tries to catch up. He wades into the water but is unable to stay afloat. He calls for his mother, but she is too far away to hear. Quacker starts to cry, then Jerry notices and tries to show him how to swim, but Quacker only flails his arms in frustration. Jerry goes to get Quacker a pair of water wings, but Quacker walks away depressed and runs into Tom who places a soup spoon that it slants upward from the ground to his can of water. Quacker fails to notice the spoon, which leads him right into Toms trap. Jerry hits Tom over the head with a wood plank and rescues Quacker. Tom chases them, but crashes into a spade, allowing Jerry and Quacker to hide. However, Quacker dives into a hole when Tom sneaks up from behind and Jerry grabs Toms hand by mistake, thus pulling Tom through a pipe causing Tom to look like a caterpillar. Jerry then runs away and dives into a lake to escape, breathing through a straw. Tom easily finds him and blows through the straw, making Jerry inflate, but Jerry inflates Toms head in return before Quacker pops Toms head with a safety pin. Jerry and Quacker flee, but Quacker falls into a bowl, allowing Tom to catapult him flying back into the can of water. As Tom prepares to eat Quacker, Jerry throws a brick which shatters Toms body. Jerry and Quacker escape, but Tom traps Jerry in a jug and chases Quacker. Quacker dodges Tom, causing Tom to fall into the water. Tom struggles to swim until Quacker bravely dives in and rescues him. Jerry helps Quacker pull Tom out and helps Tom recover before both of them hear a sound of ducks gliding by. They wave and watch on as Quacker swims with his family.
