This in-name-only sequel to the first Meatballs summer camp movie sets us at Camp Sasquatch and revolves around two main plots. The owner of Sasquatch, Giddy, tries to keep his camp open after Hershey, the owner of Camp Patton located just across the lake, wants to buy the entire lake for Camp Patton. Giddy suggests settling the issue with the traditional end-of-the-summer boxing match over rights to the lake. A tough, inner city punk named Moishe is at Camp Sasquatch for community service as a counselor-in-training. Moishe is recruited to box in order to save Sasquatch. The second main subplot involves Cheryl. She is a naive teen whom Moishe sets his sights on. Cheryls teenage girl co-campers arrange for Cheryl to see a man naked after she confesses shes never seen a "pinky." A recurring subplot throughout the movie is the campers hiding an alien from the adults. The alien, dropped off by his parents to learn Earth culture, is called "Meathead" by the kids (after he repeated one of them saying "Me, Ted").The plot takes a disturbing turn when the Bridge Troll uses her “shower-head” urination powers to disrupt The Farter’s bathroom exploits.
