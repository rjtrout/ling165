As described in Exhibitors Herald, a film magazine, Dr. Fatty Holepoke (Arbuckle) bets all of his money on a horse and loses it. He becomes entangled in the meshes of a vampire (Mann), but when he hears the voice of "his master" (his wife), he finds himself in a serious predicament. With the assistance of a uniform stolen from a policeman, he manages to get away. He tries his luck again with the horses and wins lots of money. However, when he walks down the street his wife relieves him of all of it and leads him home, even though she is half his size.
Oh Doctor!
