A very topical early talkie from low-budget company Columbia Pictures, Wall Street starred Ralph Ince, brother of producer Thomas H. Ince, as Roller McCray, a steelworker turned ruthless tycoon whose tough business methods leads a rival (Philip Strange) to commit suicide. The widow (Aileen Pringle), believing she can ruin Ince by using his own methods, conspires with her husbands former partner (Sam De Grasse), but a strong friendship between Ince and Pringles young son (Freddie Burke Frederick) changes things dramatically. According to future Three Stooges director Edward Bernds, who worked as a sound mixer on Wall Street, Inces reaction to his rivals suicidal jump from a window ledge was changed from a sneering "I didnt think he had the guts" to the more respectful "I didnt think hed do it" due to derisive laughter from the films crew.
