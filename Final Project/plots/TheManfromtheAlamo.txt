During the siege at the Alamo, John Stroud (Glenn Ford) is chosen to leave the fort and warn the families of the missions defenders of the impending arrival of General Santa Anna. But when everyone around him is wiped out by the Mexicans, Stroud has no proof that he was ordered to leave his post, and is therefore branded a coward.
