Michael Chambers returns home to celebrate his mothers remarriage. Michael had fled his hometown due to gambling indiscretions and had left his wife Rachel to deal with the mess he created. He must now reassimilate into the town, renew his relationships with his family and friends (and enemies) and, most of all, seek out his ex-wife to woo her again. Michael obtains a job working for his mothers new husband as an armored car driver. He almost seems the perfect prodigal son as he finds his niche back in the community and his way back into his ex-wifes heart. His troubles increase when he and Rachel are caught in the act by her hoodlum boyfriend, Dundee. To get out of this predicament, Michael must concoct a plan to steal a payroll being transported by his armored car company.
