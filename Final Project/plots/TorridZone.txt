Steve Case (Pat OBrien) has to deal with trouble at his tropical fruit companys Central American banana plantation. A revolutionary, Rosario La Mata (George Tobias), is stirring up unrest among the workers, and the only man who can handle the situation, foreman Nick Butler (James Cagney), has just quit. Steve manages to persuade Nick to stick around (for a big bonus). Adding to the complications is Lee Donley (Ann Sheridan), a woman whom Steve has ordered out of the region for causing a different kind of trouble among the men. There is a third term joke that refers to the 1940 election. The film borrowed plot elements from The Front Page and Red Dust and ended with Cagney saying to Sheridan "You and that 14-carat oomph", a studio in-joke in reference to Sheridans title as the Oomph Girl.
