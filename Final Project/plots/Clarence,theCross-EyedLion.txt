Animal doctors fight to protect the wildlife of Africa. An adventurous and fearless girl Paula Tracey (Cheryl Miller) is the daughter of veterinarian Dr. Marsh Tracey (Marshall Thompson), the director of the animal hospital in East Africa. While studying the wildlife and caring for the injured animals and endangered species, they find Clarence, a wild African lion whose eyes make hunting impossible. Dr. Tracey and Paula take him in and adopt him as a new member of the wildlife preserve. Clarence later saves the day when Julie Harper (Betsy Drake) and her research monkeys are threatened by poachers.
