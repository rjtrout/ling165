Sheriff Chris Hamish is recruited to bring gunfighter Bob Kallen back for trial on unspecified charges. Hamish is a brooding haunted man who has been a failure at everything he has done and even his own wife scorns him. Kallen, on the other hand, is very confident, charismatic and decent at heart. This Western was rather novel because it was an intense character study of the two protagonists as they embark on their odyssey. Along the way, Hamish admits to his prisoner that he wants to bring him in not so much in the name of justice, but for his own self redemption. Stalked by blood-thirsty Apaches and picking up an orphaned Mexican child, the lawman and the outlaw are forced to rely upon each other for survival and in the end develop a bond of admiration and respect.
