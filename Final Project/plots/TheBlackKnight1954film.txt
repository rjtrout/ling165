The blacksmith and swordsmith John (Alan Ladd) is tutored at the court of King Arthur (Anthony Bushell), but as a commoner he cant hope to win the hand of Lady Linet (Patricia Medina), daughter of the Earl of Yeonil (Harry Andrews). The Earls castle is attacked by Saracens and Cornishmen — disguised as Vikings — and his wife is killed, making him lose his memory. The attack was part of a plot by the Saracen Sir Palamides (Peter Cushing) and the pagan Cornish King Mark (Patrick Troughton) to overthrow Arthur and Christianity and take over the country, whilst pretending to be Arthurs friends and allies - Palamides is a knight of the round table and Mark has faked his own baptism. John accuses Palamides servant Bernard (Bill Brandon) of murder before Arthur, who grants him three months grace to prove the accusation or face execution himself. Another knight, Sir Ontzlake (Andre Morrell), takes pity on John and trains him in swordplay so that he can take on an alternative secret identity as the wandering Black Knight. The "Vikings" raid a newly founded monastery and take Lady Linet and its monks to Stonehenge for a pagan sacrifice, but the Black Knight arrives and saves her, closely followed by Arthur and his knights, who defeat the pagans and destroy Stonehenge. Sir Palamides tricks the Lady Linet into his castle to try to get her to reveal the Black Knights identity, but John is informed of this and saves her, still in disguise. Sir Ontzlake then sends him to King Marks castle, where a pro-Arthur woodcarver shows him a secret tunnel into the royal chambers. John arrives in time to overhear Mark and Palamides finalising their plot but Palamides beats him back to Camelot, tricking Arthur into thinking that the Black Knight is leading the Viking raids. John arrives dressed as the Black Knight and despite revealing his identity is briefly imprisoned until Lady Linet and Sir Ontzlake free him, with the latter standing bail for John to Arthur. John returns to Marks castle, where he traps Marks forces and kidnaps Mark at swordpoint. The following morning the Saracens land near Camelot and Sir Palamides and Bernard trick their way into Camelot. Bernard stabs a man in Arthurs bed, only to find it is Mark and not Arthur. John chases Bernard and he falls from the battlements, whilst Arthurs knights trick the Saracens by replying to their fire-arrow signal, which was to have been the signal for the Cornish to join the Saracen attack. The knights defeat the Saracens beneath Camelots walls, while inside them John beats Palamides single-handed. As a reward Arthur knights John and offers him the further boon of his "hearts desire". John asks to marry the Lady Linet and both she and Arthur accept.
