Years after his movie and sitcom career has run dry, Bruce Madsen is reduced to headlining one dingy comedy club after another, spending his nights in budget hotel rooms, and flying coach while his former fans sit in first class. He has only one question: What the hell happened? Amidst trying to revitalize his career, rekindle his love life, and put his daughter through college, Bruce knows one thing for sure - he must get off the road - hard. Road Hard is the story of that journey.
