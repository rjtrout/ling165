This cartoon begins as Bugs Bunny once again gets lost when he is tunneling to his vacation spot. He accidentally ends up in Scotland, instead of the La Brea Tar Pits, having once again not "made that left toin at Albahkoiky!" and mistakes a Scotsman named Angus MacRory in Highland dress and playing the bagpipes for a lady being attacked by a "horrible monster". Bugs Bunny jumps MacRory trying to rescue the "woman", and in the process he smashes his bagpipes to pieces. MacRory becomes enraged that his bagpipes have been absolutely ruined and threatens Bugs, who discovers that MacRory is actually a man, to which Bugs responds by pointing out that MacRory cant wear a kilt (mistaking it for a skirt) making it "indecent". MacRory is confused about the situation until Bugs comes back with a barrel and puts it on MacRory. Bugs then asks MacRory for the directions to the "La Brea Tar Pits in Los Ahn-galays", irritating MacRory even further until he runs and gets a blunderbuss, telling the rabbit that "there are no La Brea Tar Pits in Scotland!" When Bugs realizes the location he is in, he bids MacRory "Eh, whats up, MacDoc?" and runs for it just as MacRory shoots. MacRory chases after the bullet and picks it up ("Its been in the family for years"), puts the bullet back into his gun, and shoots at Bugs repeatedly, who dives back into his hole and comes back out moments later disguised as an elderly Scotsman accusing MacRory of "poaching on [his] property". MacRory doesnt believe him however and challenges him to a traditional Scottish duelâ€”a game. Bugs, upon hearing this, sets up a card game. MacRory corrects him, stating the challenge is a game of golf. Bugs then asks MacRory if he "ever gets tired of running those 18 bases". Of course, throughout the game Bugs manages to outsmart MacRory. On the first hole, Bugs focuses on swinging the ball, looks down at MacRory for tapping his foot impatiently which he hides behind himself and smiles at him nervously as he is distracting Bugs, and upon his first stroke missing the hole, digs another, bigger one to earn a hole in one (with the real one shown in the distance). Bugs then nails MacRorys ball to the tee so it wont go anywhere, although MacRory still gets a hole in one anyway, to Bugs protests. At hole 8, MacRory laughs at Bugs whose ball has fallen shorter of the hole than MacRorys. Bugs however turns his club into a pool cue and pots the ball into the hole, causing MacRory to break his club in half in anger. Later, after being seen hitting his ball out of a bunker multiple times to get his ball in hole 16, Bugs figures out (through imaginary sums in the air) how many hits it took. He says he got 2 strokes on the hole. MacRory, not believing Bugs at all, corrects him: "Two? FIFTY-FIVE!" An auction ensues until MacRory gives Bugs a hole in one as his "final offer". At the last hole, MacRory gets a hole in one. Bugs however misses the hole altogether and quickly digs a channel with his club for the ball to roll through into the hole. When its all said and done, Bugs declares himself the winner, much to the Scotsmans wrath, who accuses Bugs of cheating. However, MacRory accepts defeat after Bugs clears himself otherwise by mentioning about how the same situation occurred at other (fictional) golf tournaments ("the New Hebrides Open. Kaduffleblaze versus Fuddle in 19-aught-18. Fradis versus Ginfritter. Bizbo versus Stoigen in the Casablanca Amateur"), but still claims that he cant be beaten when it comes to playing bagpipes. After playing, he dares Bugs to try and top that which the rabbit does by literally dressing like a Scot and in the manner of a one-man band, manages to not only play the bagpipes, but also a trombone, saxophone, trumpet, two clarinets, cymbals on his feet, and a bass drum with his ears. Bugs takes one last glimpse at the audience before an iris-out.
