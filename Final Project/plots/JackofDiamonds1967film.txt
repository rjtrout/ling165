A master thief known as the Ace of Diamonds decides its time to retire before he gets caught, so he teaches everything he knows to Jeff Hill, his protege. Jeff begins pulling off heists, singling out glamorous film stars like Zsa Zsa Gabor, Carroll Baker and Lilli Palmer and stealing their precious jewels. On a luxury liner, Jeff, now nicknamed the "Jack of Diamonds," discovers he has a competitor aboard, another burglar pulling the same kinds of thefts. After the boat docks in Munich, Jeff goes to see the Ace, who advises him to do the same thing he did, quit while hes ahead. Jeff encounters a woman named Olga who introduces him to Nicolai, and after discovering that Olga was the other thief aboard ship, Jeff schemes with them to rob a bank vault in Paris. They are caught, but the Ace shows up and claims responsibility for the crime, sacrificing himself for Jeff and the others. The thieves agree to return the stolen jewels, but when Jeff and Olga decide to marry, Nicolai reveals he has withheld one gem to present the bride as a gift.
