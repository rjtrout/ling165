Carol Lambert is a cigarette girl in a posh Florida hotel. A note is delivered to the resorts bandleader, Gene Ritchie, requesting that Carol get a chance to sing. Gene already has a singer, Mona St. Clair, so the note causes resentment and Carol is fired. Mrs. Whitmore, the hotels owner, likes Carol and rehires her. Meantime, a con artist who calls himself "Colonel" Morgan turns up and, with partner Billy, begins scamming the hotels guests. An embarrassed Carol tries to cover for him. Morgan uses his charms to persuade Mrs. Whitmore to let Carol sing. Shes a great success, but when an irate Mona reveals that Morgans a con man who has even promised to deliver a new benefactor for the band, the musicians walk out. Carol arranges an all-girl band for Gene and its a hit. She and Gene hit it off, too.
