Whilst she is on the way, Lance Harper (Randall England) murders the wealthy womans husband, Jack Chamberlain (Jeremy Slate), who Harper was in various trouble with at the time. The body is stored in the trunk of his Porsche. Upon the arrival of Chamberlains wife, who came to take back the Porsche, Harper disappears into the night, as Mrs. Chamberlain drives away, not knowing her cheating husband has been murdered and is in under the hood of the car she is driving. Barry Davis, played by Corey Haim, is doing his rounds as a piano tuner for his parents business whilst they are on holiday, when his dreams of fast cars become a reality as he is given a silver Porsche turbo for free by Mrs. Chamberlain who wants to get even with her cheating husband, whom she had originally purchased it for. Davis, who cannot believe his luck, does not realise that Jack Chamberlains corpse is under the hood of his dream car. While Davis is evading fraternity boys and pursuing his dream girl, he becomes mixed up in the homicide as Lance Harper tracks him down by phoning every Barry Davis in the phone book and asking Is this Barry Davis the piano tuner?. Harper homes in on him and a fight ensues in the Davis household. Barry eventually overpowers Lance and he is arrested. In the end he keeps the car, gets the girl and has a neat blonde haircut.
