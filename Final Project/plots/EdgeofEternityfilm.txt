The film begins with an attempted murder of a man who has parked his car and is looking into the Grand Canyon with binoculars. The killer releases the emergency brake and pushes the vehicle toward the man, the intent being to have the car strike him and take him with it over the edge. The man is able to leap out of the way at the last moment. A fierce struggle ensues and the man kills his attacker by using his foot to shove him over the rim. The man is seen wandering, disheveled and talking apparent nonsense by Eli, an old prospector who tells a Deputy Sheriff (Cornel Wilde) about it. However, Eli has a reputation for telling tall tales, so the deputy ignores him to chase an attractive woman, Janice Kendon (Victoria Shaw), speeding recklessly down the road. Upon returning to the abandoned mining office Eli calls home, he finds the man dead, hanging with his hands bound behind him. The Deputy and Janice team up to solve the murders and end a plot to illegally mine gold to sell in Mexico.
