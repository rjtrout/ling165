Ted Wiggins is a 12-year-old, idealistic boy, who lives in Thneedville, a walled city that, aside from the human citizens, is almost completely artificial; everything is made of plastic, metal, or synthetics with no living plants. Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a "real tree" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Granny Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty, barren wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his next trip, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius OHare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen ("fresh air") to Thneedville residents. OHare forbids Ted from talking about trees, saying they are dangerous, but really its because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business. After revealing that he has "security camera eyes" all over the city, OHare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of OHares sight (with his grandmothers encouragement) and learns more of the trees history. Over Teds various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story that when he was a young man, he departed his family to find good material for his Thneed invention and make a business. The Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula tree in a lush Truffula tree forest valley. The Lorax urges the Once-ler to leave the forest, but the Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts. Then, the young businessmans Thneed invention becomes a major success and the Once-lers family arrives to participate in the business. At first keeping his promise, the Once-ler continues Thneed production by harvesting the Truffula tree tufts in a slow, but sustainable manner. However, his greedy and lazy relatives soon convince him to resume chopping down the trees. Overtime, the Once-lers deforestation spirals into a mass overproduction. Flushed with wealth, the Once-ler rationalizes his short-sighted needs into arrogant self-righteousness, and the Loraxs helpless protests do not stop him. The Once-ler pollutes the sky, river, and landscape, until the very last Truffula Tree falls. With no further chance of business, he is left broken and his mother disowns him. With the region uninhabitable because of the pollution and deforestation from the Once-lers business, the Lorax sends the animals off to find a new place to live before the Once-ler sees him depart into the sky, leaving only a stone-cut word: "Unless". Distraught and ruined, the Once-ler becomes a recluse. After he finishes telling his story, the Once-ler finally understands the meaning behind the Loraxs last message, and gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes that he can plant it and make others care about real trees once more. Teds desire to impress Audrey also becomes a personal mission to remind his town of the importance of nature. OHare, still determined not to have trees undermine his business, takes heavy-handed steps such as covering Audreys nature paintings, closing off the door that Ted uses to see the Once-ler, and forcibly searching Teds room for the seed, which has begun to grow after accidentally having some water from Teds falling bottle. Ted enlists his family and Audrey to help plant the seed. OHare and his two henchmen pursue the dissidents until they manage to elude him and reach the town center. When Ted finally attempts to plant the seed, he is interrupted by OHare, who rallies the population to stop them by telling the people that trees are extremely dangerous and filthy. To convince them otherwise, Ted takes an earthmover and rams down a section of the city wall to reveal the environmental destruction outside, thereby showing them what OHare is encouraging. Horrified at the sight and inspired by Teds conviction (as though a part of the Lorax is within him), the crowd turns against OHare when they discover his true nature, with his own henchmen expelling him from the town with his jet pack-like helmet, and the seed is finally planted. Time passes and the land starts to recover; new trees sprout, the animals begin to return, and the redeemed, now-mustached Once-ler happily reunites with the Lorax.
