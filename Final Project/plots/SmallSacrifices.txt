On 19 May 1983 at approximately 10:48 p.m, Downs (portrayed by Fawcett) drove to McKenzie-Willamette Hospital in Springfield, Oregon with a gunshot wound to her arm. She claimed that an unknown assailant attempted to carjack her and shot her three children: Karen, 8 (real name Christie Ann); Shauna, 7 (Cheryl Lynn); and Robby, 3 (Stephen Daniel). Shauna was dead on arrival at the hospital. Eldest daughter Karen was badly injured, but survived suffering a temporary loss of speech due to a stroke after the shooting, but recovered sufficiently to serve as a witness in court against her mother. Dianes son was paralyzed from the chest down. Downs was diagnosed with three cluster B personality disorders: antisocial, histrionic and narcissistic. She was eventually tried and convicted of murder, attempted murder, and assault. During the court scene the prosecution plays Duran Durans Hungry Like the Wolf to demonstrate to the jury Dianes choice of song used to motivate her to kill. The film shows that Downs started a romance with a married man, Lew Lewiston (played by ONeal; the mans real name was Robert Knickerbocker) who did not want children. Downs planned to kill her children to be free to pursue this relationship. He ended the relationship and remained with his wife. Diane Downs is sentenced to life in prison, and her two surviving children are adopted by the prosecutor Frank Joziak and his wife Lola (the real life couple were named Fred and Joanne Hugi).
