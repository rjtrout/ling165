Isaac Barr (Richard Gere) is a top-notch, San Francisco-based Freudian psychiatrist, who has Diana Baylor (Uma Thurman) on the patients couch. He is treating her for frightening and horrific childhood memories, which include images of her drunken father and his death in a fire for which she wasnt blamed. One night, Heather Evans (Kim Basinger) enters Barrs office and says that she is Dianas sister. She asks Barr for information about her sisters case. It is implied, as part of the treatment, that Isaac speak to Heather to find out more about her sisters past experiences and determine if she might provide information that Diana has forgotten. Not long after, Heather seduces Isaac, and a steamy affair follows. However, there is a problemâ€”Heather is married to Jimmy Evans (Eric Roberts), a violent and wealthy Greek gangster. She also has a way of embarrassing Jimmy in public by taking a sip of wine and then flipping into an attack of "pathological intoxication", which can end with the restaurant in shambles. It turns out that Heather is trying to involve unsuspecting Isaac in a plan to murder Jimmy and collect a $4 million double indemnity life insurance policy on him. She is also using Diana as bait and wants Isaac framed for the murder.
