To get even with Bubber and Rose for "behaving badly", Shirley pricks a hole in Roses diaphragm. Shirley goes on to live with her father and Bubber moves in with Rose along with his pet tiger. The diaphragm incident results in Rose getting pregnant with Bubbers baby. The couple must decide whether to keep the baby and continue their May/December romance or part ways.
