As described in a film magazine, Armand Duval (Roscoe), a son in the proud but poor house of Duval, loves Camille (Bara), a notorious Parisian beauty. His love for Camille means that his sister Celeste (Whitney) cannot marry the man she loves, so the father goes to Camille and begs her to give Armand up, which she does. This arouses the anger of Armand and he denounces her one evening in public. The Count de Varville (Law) challenges Armand to a duel which he wins, wounding Armand in the arm. Believing Camille no longer loves him, Armand does not go to see her. One day his father tells him that Camille is dying. He goes to her and, after a few words, she dies in the arms of her lover.
