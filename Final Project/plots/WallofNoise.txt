A horse trainer, Joel Tarrant, needs a job and is hired by Matt Rubio, a wealthy building contractor. Joel has a girlfriend, Ann, but is tempted by the advances of Rubios seductive wife, Laura. Laura knows there is a horse Joel feels can become a champion and persuades him to buy it. He borrows money from Johnny Papadakis to do so, but the horse is injured and Rubio fires him after recognizing the relationship between his wife and Joel, who is unable to repay Papadakis his debt. Ann goes to great lengths to help him out of trouble, even offering herself to Papadakis as a form of payment. But after Papadakis dies unexpectedly, Joel and Ann return to their lives, looking after their recovering horse.
