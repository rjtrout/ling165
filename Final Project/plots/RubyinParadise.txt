Ruby is the narrator of the film. She leaves Tennessee, landing in Panama City, Florida, a summer resort town she visited as a child. Although she arrives there in fall, at the beginning of the off-season, she gets a job at Chambers Beach Emporium, a souvenir store run by Mildred Chambers, overcoming the owners initial rejection of her employment application by telling her "Ive done retail before, and I work real cheap." Over the course of a year she keeps a journal (from which the films narration is taken) and contemplates her career ups and downs, her love life, her past, and her future. Rubys introspective narration is interspersed with routine scenes at the souvenir store or conversations with her friend Rochelle, or the men she dates, Ricky and Mike.
