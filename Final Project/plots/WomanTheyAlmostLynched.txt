Civil War factions along the Arkansas-Missouri border are warned by Border Citys mayor, Delilah Courtney, to stay five miles from her neutral town or risk arrest. Quantrill, a former Confederate officer gone rogue, brings his gang of marauders to the region, including wife Kate, who he kidnapped from Border City two years ago. Another new arrival is Sally Maris, who has traveled from Michigan to join her brother, Bitterroot Bill, the owner of a saloon. Kate takes an immediate dislike to Sally and challenges her to a fight, which Sally wins, then a gunfight, where Sally also surprises Kate with her skill with a weapon. Bill is killed, and has left behind so many debts, Sally must stay to run the business. Quantrills interest in a mine, owned by Delilah, pits him against foreman Lance Horton, who is secretly a Confederate spy. Sally falls in love with Lance, who is wounded in a gunfight. After saving Kates life during the melee, the women join forces. Sally prevents the arrest of Lance by claiming to be the spy herself. She is about to be hanged by vigilantes, but Kate reveals the truth, then rides off with the men in hot pursuit, saving Sally.
