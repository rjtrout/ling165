The Stooges are three hapless tramps. After nearly destroying a farmers (Richard Fiske) pile of firewood, and destroying some of his equipment, they hit the road. Curly wishes they had a car after they stop for a break. By accident they think theyve found a car for free and take it. After driving around for a bit the boys come to the assistance of the Widow Jenkins (Eva McKenzie). She graciously gives them a huge meal and in return they offer to fix her broken outdoor water pump. As the Stooges attempt to fix the pump, they discover oil hidden under the farm when the pump turns into an oil geyser. They are happy for the lady and her beautiful daughters, until she regretfully tells them she had sold the farm. The Stooges realize she was cheated out of her land by a trio of swindlers (Dick Curtis, Eddie Laughton, James Craig). They manage to retrieve the deed to the land and are allowed to marry the now wealthy Widow Jenkins daughters.
