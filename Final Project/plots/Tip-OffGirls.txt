A ring of truck hijackers is organized by Joseph Valkus, run by Red Deegan and fronted by Rena Terry, a woman who pretends to be helpless, tricking truckers to trust her before their shipments are stolen. Out to bust up the racket, the FBI assigns agents Bob Anders and Tom Benson to go undercover. Pretending to be drivers, then thieves, they gain Valkuss trust. Bob also meets and falls for Marjorie Rogers, a secretary who is totally unaware of the illegal activities. Bob is overheard tipping off the FBI to the next heist. He is beaten by Valkuss men, but Marjorie manages to write and deliver a note that brings federal agents to the rescue.
