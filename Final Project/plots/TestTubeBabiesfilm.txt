Husband George Bennet (William Thomason) confronts his wife about the widening chasm between them; she tells him she feels they are somehow incomplete without children. She undergoes testing to see why she hasnt conceived. George, who has accompanied her, is asked to also undergo testing and is found to be the problem: he is sterile.
