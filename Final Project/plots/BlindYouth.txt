As described in a film magazine, when Elizabeth (McDowell) and Pierre Monnier (Swickard) part, the mother takes one son, Henry (Kinny), while the father takes the other, Maurie (McGrail), to Paris. Maurie shows promise as a sculptor, but his life is ruined when he marries Clarice (Carew) and she deserts him to go with Jules Chandoce, a returning soldier. When his father dies, Maurie returns to New York, but finds his mother and brother ashamed of him. He walks the street for a time and contemplates suicide, but becomes inspired after meeting artist model Hope Martin (Joy). With her posing for him he makes a figure called "Blind Youth" which makes him famous overnight. After confessing his love to Hope, he tells her of his unfortunate marriage. Clarice reappears to share Mauries recent fortune, but, after finally realizing that his happiness means more to her than money, she confesses to him that their marriage was illegal as Chandoce really was her husband. Maurie and Hope then wed.
