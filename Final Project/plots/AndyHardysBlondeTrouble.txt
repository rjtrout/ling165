Blonde Trouble picks up from the previous installment of the Andy Hardy saga with Andy on a train to begin his college career at Wainwright College. While on the train, he meets Kay Wilson (Bonita Granville), and learns that Wainright College has just become a coeducational institution. The Dean of Wainwright College (and soon to be Andys faculty advisor), Dr. Standish (Herbert Marshall) is also on the train. Dr. Standishs identity is not revealed to Andy until later. Problems begin almost immediately for Andy as he learns his father forgot to give him his train ticket. Lyn and Lee Walker (Wilde Twins) are also on the train in a private cabin. They are on their way to Wainright College as well, but their father thinks Lee is on her way to spend some time with her aunt in Vermont. The twins cant handle the idea of being separated, so they travel together to Wainright College in hopes of passing themselves off as one girl. On the train, and later at Wainwright, the girls pull the switcheroo on Andy, leaving him completely confused with this mysterious blondes ever changing behavior. After discovering that they have run out of money, the twins coax Andy into giving them a total of $37.95 cash before he realizes that he has been fooled. After classes at Wainwright College begin, Andys troubles continue to build, causing him to consider quitting college. Before this happens, though, he manages to help the twins out of their trouble.
