Watermarks tells the story of the champion women swimmers of Hakoah Vienna. Hakoah was founded in 1909 in response to the notorious Aryan Paragraph, which forbade Austrian sports clubs from accepting Jewish athletes. Its founders were eager to popularize sport among a community renowned for such great minds as Freud, Mahler and Zweig, but traditionally alien to physical recreation. Hakoah rapidly grew into one of Europes biggest athletic clubs, achieving astonishing success in many diverse sports. In the 1930s Hakoahs best-known triumphs came from its women swimmers, who dominated national competitions in Austria. After the Anschluss, the political unification of Nazi Germany and Austria in 1938, the Nazis shut down the club. The club’s functionaries organized for the swimmers to flee Austria to disparate locations in Palestine, Europe, Asia and the United States. Sixty-five years later, director Yaron Zilberman meets the members of the women’s swim team in their homes around the world, and arranges for them to have a reunion in their old swimming pool in Vienna. Told by the swimmers, now in their eighties, Watermarks traces back the story of a group of young girls with a passion to be the best.
