Marco Perkins (Oakie) is a garage mechanic and a would-be-prizefighter who gets a place on the ritzy country clubs polo team because he is the towns most proficient mallet-wielder, having learned to play polo while serving in U.S. army. His hobnobbing with the town-elite and social upper-crust at the polo-matches gives him an inflated idea of his social position, and he decides he is moving on up. He breaks off with his girl-friend, true-blue Cynthia Brown (Brian), and hits on d√©butante Gloria Staunton (Borden), who appears to have an interest in being hit upon. Glorias interest lies mostly in showing marco that hired-hands who can play polo still arent to the manor born.
