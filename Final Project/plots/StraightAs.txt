Scott (Ryan Phillippe) is a man who has been in and out of rehabilitation for 10 years and is haunted by the ghost of his dead mother pressing him to return home to the family he turned his back on years ago. Outfitted with nothing more than a bag of pills and a sack of marijuana (and a horse instead of a car), he goes back to Texas only to be faced with his brotherâ€™s wife Katherine (Paquin), who he is still pining for, his first love.
