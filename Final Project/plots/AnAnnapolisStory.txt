Brothers Tony (John Derek) and Jim Scott (Kevin McCarthy) enroll as midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. Jim, the older one, looks after the more impulsive Tony and helps him pass a difficult test so he can play football in the big Army-Navy game. The game, however, shows that Tony cannot follow the coachs directions and gets benched. After the game, Jim introduces his brother to his longtime girlfriend, Peggy Lord (Diana Lynn), and a rivalry soon develops over her affections. With the Korean War looming on the horizon, during training, Jim and Tony are assigned to the same aircraft carrier. Jim continues to look out for his younger brother, even risking his own life. During a maneuver at sea involving helicopter and naval jets, Tonys aircraft plummets off the deck in an aborted takeoff and he is knocked unconscious. Jim dives from a helicopter into the sea to rescue his brother. When Tony is sent to the Naval Academy hospital to recuperate, he resumes courting Peggy and asks her to marry him. Peggy turns him down and is torn between the two brothers because Jim had already asked her to marry, and she had put him off until after the Korean War is over. After graduation, the two brothers are no longer close. As they begin advance training as jet pilots at the Pensacola Naval Station, Tony attempts to patch up the relationship, but Jim rebuffs him. Assigned to an aircraft carrier overseas, Tony and Jim end up on leave in Tokyo, where Tony meets Peggy, who tells him that it is Jim whom she really loves. He finally accepts the situation, and when he has the chance to make amends, Tony not only rescues his older brother during a dangerous mission, but also courageously fights off an enemy fighter during the rescue attempt. Checking on his wounded brother, he sees Peggy is there already and that Jim and Peggy will be happy together.
