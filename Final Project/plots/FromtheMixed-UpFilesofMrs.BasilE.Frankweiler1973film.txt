The movie, following the plot of the book by the same name, starts with young teenager Claudia Kinkaid (Sally Prager) feeling unappreciated at her home in New Jersey, so she decides to run away, taking along her younger brother Jamie (Johnny Doran). They run away to New York City, and end up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They stay in the museum for several nights, sleeping in beds featured in the museum, hiding from museum guards, and bathing in the fountain. For money, they grab coins out of the bottom of the fountain and use them to get food out of the vending machine. Eventually, Claudia finds a statue of an angel she believes was carved by Michelangelo, so she decides to find the previous owner of the statue. This owner, named Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler (Ingrid Bergman), tells Claudia and Jamie that she will leave them the secret of the angel statue in her will if they give her a full account of their adventure.
