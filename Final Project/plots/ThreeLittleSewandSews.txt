The Stooges are sailors employed in the tailor shop of a naval base. After becoming dissatisfied with their work, they steal three officers uniforms (including that of Admiral Taylor, the highest-ranking officer on the base) in the hopes of gaining both the respect of other men and the romantic attention of women. While pretending to be the Admiral, Curly and his "aides" (Moe and Larry, calling themselves Captain Presser and Commander Button, respectively) attend a party in the Admirals place. Unbeknownst to them, the party was planned by enemy spies, who intended to use the get together as a front to gain access to sensitive information from Admiral Taylor. Subsequently, they are tricked into stealing a submarine by a pair of spies, led by Count Alfred Gehrol (Harry Semels). The Stooges eventually capture the spies, partly thanks to dumb luck, but whilst reenacting the capture for the real Admiral, Curly accidentally detonates an air bomb dropped from a plane, which had been launched in an attempt to sink the submarine. Everyone on board is killed; the short ends with the Stooges, now angels ascending to heaven, being chased by an angry Admiral, who is also now an angel, as Curly warns Moe & Larry to step on it.
