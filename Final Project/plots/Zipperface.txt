A sadomasochistic serial killer in a bondage suit is running amok in Palm City, murdering stage actresses who moonlight as BDSM prostitutes. Assigned to the case are Detectives Lisa Ryder and Harry Shine, who are under pressure to apprehend the culprit as soon as possible in order to appease the ruthless Mayor Angela Harris. As the duos investigation progresses, they uncover a number of different suspects, including a misogynist fellow officer named Willy Scalia, a cross-dressing mayors aide named Devon McClain, a charitable preacher named Reverend Dimsdale, and a professional photographer named Michael Walker. Lisa begins dating Michael in secret, which leads to her suspension from the force when mounting circumstantial evidence points towards him being "Zipperface". After a warrant is put out for Michaels arrest, he and Lisa go to confront Reverend Dimsdale, having realized that he is in some way connected to all of Zipperfaces victims, possibly acting as a pimp for the sex workers who he was supposed to be helping find God. The two discover the reverend dead from a slit throat, and question one of his prostitutes, who informs them that Dimsdale had earlier called her, begging her not to go to her appointment with a new "John". Lisa and Michael follow the directions that the prostitute had been given to an abandoned warehouse that contains Zipperfaces sex dungeon, unaware that they are being tailed by Detective Shine. Zipperface wounds Michael and attempts to strangle Lisa, but she is saved when Michael recovers and stabs Zipperface with his own machete, incapacitating him long enough for Shine to arrive with both backup and Mayor Harris. Zipperface is unmasked to reveal that he is the mayors husband, Brewster. After her husband rants about how feelings of emasculation drove him to dominate and eventually murder prostitutes, the distraught Mayor Harris, realizing that her political career is now over, pulls out a gun and shoots Brewster.
