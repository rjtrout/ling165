Irish villager Kathleen is a tenant of Captain Clearfield, who controls local judges and criminals. Her father owes Clearfield a large debt. Terence OMore saves the village from Clearfield, causing a large celebration. Film historian Charles Musser writes of Porters adaptation, "OMore not only rescues Kathleen from the villain but, through marriage, renews the family for another generation."
