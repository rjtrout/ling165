Leo, the main character, is a Holocaust survivor who suffers from total amnesia. When he immigrates to the U.S. he manages to find a job as a hotel desk clerk. When he accepts a drink in the hotel bar, he suddenly starts singing, amazing those around him—and himself—with his magnificent voice. Taking advantage of his gift, he begins singing in nightclubs. Eventually, with the help of a psychiatrist and partly as a result of a blow to the head during a mugging, his memories begin to return, and he realizes that he is the son of a great Jewish Hazzan (Cantor) in Europe. As memories of his parents, who perished in the Holocaust, return to him, he abandons his nightclub career to follow his fathers footsteps as a synagogue cantor. The final scene shows Leo (who now remembers that his real name is "David") singing during a synagogue service. In one crucial scene in the movie, Leo imagines himself ascending the bimah of a ruined synagogue in Europe, singing the ancient Jewish prayer "El male rachamim" in memory of all the Jews who died in the Holocaust. By actually returning to the synagogue as a cantor, the film shows how he is restoring "the sacred music of a vanquished culture to a living Jewish community."
