Tyler Craden is disbarred by the legal profession after destroying evidence against his client, gangster Mardeen, following the murder of a cop. While on vacation, Craden ends up in a town where a murder trial is taking place. He is impressed by defense attorney Joan Carroll and gets her a job with a firm run by Roberts, a corrupt pal of his. Bradley Kent, an honest prosecutor, is both rival and suitor to Joan. She rejects marriage proposals from Kent and Craden both, but joins the district attorneys office to fight crime. Mardeen turns up and tries to blackmail Craden, who shoots him. The DA arrests Craden and Roberts, which frees Joan to continue her work and also to marry Kent.
