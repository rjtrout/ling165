Gil Jones (Ronald Reagan) is an American who runs a Mexico ranch. A woman he loves, Lucia Pell (Laraine Day), has married a New York businessman, Morgan Pell (Tom Conway), possibly for his money. Gil and his Uncle Henry (Lionel Barrymore) are in debt and banker Jasper Hardy could foreclose at any time. Morgan and the banker both want the land, which may have oil under it. Mexican bandit Pancho Lopez (Beery), meanwhile, rustles the cattle and kidnaps everyone but Gil, holding them for ransom. Gil fights off Lopezs men, who get a noose ready until Lopez recognizes Gil as a man who long ago saved his life. The cowardly Morgan offers the land and even Lucia if only Lopez will turn him loose. He later shoots one of Lopezs men in the back and flees. He pulls a gun on Gil and Lucia later, but Lopez rides to their rescue.
