Easygoing cowboy Dempsey Rae (Kirk Douglas) and his boastful but impressionable young friend Jeff Jimson (William Campbell), both from Kansas City, "ride the rails" into a Wyoming cattle town. They witness the murder of the train guard en-route and net a $100 reward when they reach the next town. Dempsey has a female acquaintance in town (Idonee) and both decide to stay, after being hired to work (as alleged fellow-Texans) by Strap Davis, on a 10,000 head ranch for an absentee rancher named Reed Bowman. When Bowman finally arrives, Dempsey is surprised to find that he has been working for a very attractive woman (Jeanne Crain), one who has very ambitious plans. Her plans lead to a range war with her neighbors. Dempsey defects to the opposing side but ultimately sides with Jimson, before riding off to a new life. About half-way through the movie, Dempsey tells Jeff that many men follow a star to set their destination. When asked by Jeff what star he follows, Dempsey tells him that he follows no particular star. Therefore, hes a man without a star.
