The daughter of a wealthy industrialist wants to take over the company when her father retires, but the father—an old-fashioned sort who doesnt believe that "girls" belong in business—is planning on leaving the company to her wastrel playboy brother. In order to prove to her dad that she can handle the job, she disguises herself as an ordinary "working girl" and gets a job in her dads plant. There she meets and falls in love with a clerk. She brings the young man home to meet her folks, but during the evening the family safe is robbed, and all signs point to her new boyfriend.
