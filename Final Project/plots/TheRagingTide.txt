The film tells of Bruno Felkin (Conte) as a San Francisco crime boss. After he kills off a mob rival, he tries to arrange an alibi with his girlfriend Connie Thatcher (Winters). However, she isnt available, which forces Felkin to hide out on a fishing boat owned by Hamil Linder (Bickford) until Connie his moll can be located. Far from the perfect guest, Felkin tries to motivate Linders son Carl (Alex Nicol) into doing his dirty work until the police is of his trail. Gradually, however, Felkin, and Connie, become reformed by the decency and humanity of the Linder family. Cop Kelsey (Stephen McNally) continues to pursue Felkin and might not see things in this new light.
