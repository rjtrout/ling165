At the 2002 World Winter Sport Games, rival mens singles skaters Chazz Michael Michaels, a skillful skater but raunchy sex addict, and Jimmy MacElroy, an equally talented but sheltered and effeminate skater, tie for gold. While standing on the awards podium, the two have an argument that escalates into a fight and ends with the World Games mascot being accidentally set on fire. As a result, the National Figure Skating Association strips both men of their medals and bans them from mens singles competition for life. Jimmys competitive adoptive father, billionaire Darren MacElroy, immediately disowns him and leaves him stranded on the side of the road. Three and a half years later, both men have grudgingly taken on alternative occupations: Jimmy is working at a winter sporting goods store. He gets demoted to stockroom duty when he refuses to listen to a little girl when she tells him her skating boot has been tied too tightly. Chazz plays the role of "The Evil Wizard" in a childrens skating show called "Grublets On Ice", until he is fired for ruining the show by being in a drunken stupor on stage. Jimmys obsessive stalker, Hector, tells him of a loophole in the ban allowing him to compete in pair skating. In hopes of entering the upcoming World Winter Sport Games, Jimmy contacts his old coach, Robert, but is unable to find a partner. Jimmys search for a last-minute partner leads him to Chazz, and Robert convinces the two to skate as the first-ever same-sex pairs team, because the regulations fail to state the genders of the pairs. Robert informs them that to win, they will need to get along and perform an element that has never been performed successfully: The "Iron Lotus", an extremely complicated maneuver that Robert developed years ago. However, it is also dangerous: the only attempt of the maneuver was "behind the Bamboo Curtain" in North Korea, and resulted in the man decapitating the woman with his skate blade. Nonetheless, they decide to attempt it as Robert is convinced that two males would be better suited for the move because of the physics of a same-sex team. In the meantime, brother and sister competitors Stranz Van Waldenberg, and Fairchild Van Waldenberg are worried that their spot as the top team is threatened when Jimmy and Chaz perform well at a Winter Sports Games qualifier, command Katie Van Waldenberg, their younger sister, to disrupt the duo by going out with Jimmy and then having sex with Chazz. Since Katie has fallen in love with Jimmy after going on a date with him, her elder siblings threaten to harm him if she does not comply. Katie gets Chazzs attention after attending a sex addicts meeting as the newest member, then invites Chazz to her room, and tries to seduce him. Chazz refuses out of respect for Jimmy, delighting Katie, but cannot resist grabbing her breasts. Jimmy witnesses this and is outraged at Chazzs and Katies betrayals. Chazz attempts numerous times to apologize to Jimmy, but is unsuccessful. In an attempt to sabotage the performance the following day, Stranz and Fairchild kidnap both Chazz and Jimmy, but both are able to escape. Chazz and Jimmy arrive in the ice rink just in time to compete, where they reconcile quickly and begin their routine. Fairchild, seeing the two doing well, throws pearls onto the ice, causing Chazz to trip and break his ankle, rendering him unable to perform his role in the Iron Lotus. Jimmy then offers to switch places with him. Although they have never practiced the others roles, they perform it perfectly, winning the competition. Jimmy reconciles with Katie, and Stranz and Fairchild are arrested due to the kidnappings and Stranz accidentally shooting a mascot. Stranz and Fairchild begin arguing, then kiss each other incestuously before they are handcuffed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Jimmy and Chazz receive the gold medal and fly off into the sky via rockets on their skates. During the credits, Hector is seen playing with dolls of himself, Jimmy and Chazz.
