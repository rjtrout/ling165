An arrogant, aloof television personality gets more than he bargained for when he consents to be leader to a troop of Boy Scouts. The sponsor of Robert Jordans (Clifton Webb) TV program says he might cancel the show because Jordan appeals only to a middle-aged following and is out of touch with a younger audience. Jordan takes his troubles home to wife Helen (Frances Dee), who wants a child of her own. When he learns that Helen has donated a favorite suit to a Boy Scout clothing drive, Jordan goes to retrieve it, but is flabbergasted when 8-year-old Mike Marshall (George Winslow) insists he pay full price for it. The boy returns the money, impressing the Jordans. When the couple pursue adoption through the local church, Rev. Dr. Stone (Edmund Gwenn) mentions that the Scout troop is in need of a new scoutmaster. Jordan sees it as a chance to find out more about children, but is appalled by their rowdy behavior. Mike is too young to be a Scout, but persists in joining every activity. Jordan discovers that Mike is an orphan who lives with an irresponsible aunt. Mike comes to the Scoutmasters rescue in the woods when Jordan gets trapped inside a sleeping bag. The Jordans decide to adopt the boy, and Roberts television show is continued.
