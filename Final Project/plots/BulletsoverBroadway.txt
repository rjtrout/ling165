In 1928, David Shayne is an idealistic young playwright newly arrived on Broadway. In order to gain financing for his play, God of Our Fathers, he agrees to hire actress Olive Neal, the girlfriend of a gangster. She is demanding and talentless, but her gangster escort Cheech turns out to be a genius, who constantly comes up with excellent ideas for revising the play. As the players prepare for opening night, Shayne is soon in over his head claiming Cheechs rewrites as his own, cheating on his partner Ellen with the shows seductive, alcoholic leading lady Helen Sinclair, and facing his leading man, a compulsive eater, beginning an affair with Olive.
