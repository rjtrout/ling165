He turns up in towns and is part of a group who sets up corrupt boxing matches. Daves life on the margins changes after he meets a mother and son. As he begins to care for them, he ultimately has to decide whether to continue in his low-life ways or turn the tables on those who have been forcing him to participate in them.
