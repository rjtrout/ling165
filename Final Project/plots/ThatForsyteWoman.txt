Irene (Greer Garson) is the wife of Victorian "man of property" Soames Forsyte (Errol Flynn), having married without love but after many proposals. Rebelling against her husbands preoccupation with material possessions, a list in which she is included, Irene falls in love with unconventional architect Philip Bosinney (Robert Young), who is engaged to Soames niece June (Janet Leigh), one of Irenes closest friends. Soames learns of Irenes affair with Bosinney, and rather than allowing Irene to leave him, he reasserts his physical rights. When Soames and Bosinney discover that Irene has run away, Bosinney rushes out in the foggy London streets after her, only to be run over in an accident. After Irene learns of Bosinneys death she takes refuge with Soames cousin Young Jolyon (Walter Pidgeon), who is Junes estranged father but has sympathy for Irenes plight. Irene and Young Jolyon eventually marry, after Irene spurns Soamess attempts at reconciliation.
