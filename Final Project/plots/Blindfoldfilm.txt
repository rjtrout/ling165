General Pratt, a national security chief, and his aides approach Dr. Bartholomew Snow, a successful psychiatrist for his assistance to the United States Government for which he is sworn to secrecy. A patient once psychoanalyzed by Dr. Snow is a government scientist who evidently has had a mental breakdown. General Pratt, hides the patient, Arthur Vicenti, in a remote place known only as "Base X," forcing Dr. Snow to wear a blindfold whenever he is taken there by airplane and car. Enemy agents and an organisation who kidnap and sell scientists to the highest bidder want to know what Vicenti knows, so he is in danger. The patients sister, beautiful Vicky Vicenti, mistakenly believes that Dr. Snow is the one who abducted him. When she has the doctor arrested, Snow tells both the authorities and the press that he and Vicky are actually having a lovers quarrel and are engaged to be married in order to keep the Vicenti affair secret. Snow is a man with seven failed engagements and sees nothing wrong with using a false engagement to keep Vicky quiet. All are satisfied with the explanation except a suspicious NYPD detective named Harrigan. A stuttering man named Fitzpatrick turns up for a session with Dr Snow and shows CIA credentials. Fitzpatrick claims to Dr. Snow that it is actually General Pratt himself who is the enemy agent that makes sense to Dr Snow as he could not understand why Vicenti would not have been placed in a military hospital. Unable to find the general, and with the authorities unwilling to reveal whether General Pratt or Fitzgerald work for the US Government, Dr. Snow tries to recreate sounds he heard while blindfolded to trace his way back to Base X. He does so, only to find that Fitzpatrick has taken both Vicenti and Pratt captive. But soldiers arrive in airboats and place Fitzpatrick under arrest, leaving Vicky to consider whether she would like her make-believe engagement to Dr. Snow to be real.
