A twisted mid-90s comedy disguised as a 1970s drive-in film, Kill the Moonlight is the story of Chance, a fish hatchery worker, toxic waste cleaner and aspiring race car driver, whose goal in life is to fix up his stock car and follow his dreams of speedway glory. Director Steven Hanft captures the surreal life of a loser stock car racer, Chance, with laconic pacing, and bizarre humor.
