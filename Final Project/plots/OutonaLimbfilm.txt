Hotshot businessman Bill Campbell (Broderick) has returned to his hometown of Buzzsaw at the request of his younger sister Marci (Peldon), who is convinced that their stepfather Mayor Van Der Haven (Jones) has been murdered and replaced by his twin brother Matt Skearns. On the way to Buzzsaw, Bills car and clothes (including his wallet which contains an important contact number) are stolen by a woman named Sally (Kling) and he is forced to hitchhike home naked, where he is picked up by two drunken brothersâ€”both named Jim (Monks and Reilly). Over the course of the day, Campbell must find Sally, retrieve his wallet, and avoid the diabolical Skearns, who is looking for financial compensation after spending 15 years in prison for a crime committed by his twin brother. The film ends with Skearns driving off a cliff and into a canyon, rather than risk capture by the police. Marci, who tells her classmates what happened, introduces them to her brother and his wife, Sally. Marci also tells her classmates that the Jim brothers were congratulated as heroes for trying to bring a criminal to justice. Both were given jobs as FBI informants.
