Big pug George Wilson shows up at a motel and diner run by Ma and Pa Karlsen, saying hes supposed to meet his manager, Dolan. He catches the eye of another customer, the attractive Miss Gormley, but she seems to be in a bad mood. George has a fight lined up, but boxing promoters Guido and Healy believe that Dolan has run off with Georges advance payment. George decides to go ahead with the fight, with down-and-out trainer Al Muntz agreeing to work in his corner. By winning the fight, George angers ex-boxer Willie Foltis, who had bet heavily on the loser. George stays with the Karlsens and becomes better acquainted with Miss Gormley, who, it turns out, had also come there to meet Dolan, who was trying to blackmail her into marriage. A bout with the tough "Soldier" Freeman is set up, but Guido and Healy insist that George throw the fight. Muntz warns him that Guido and Healy are connected with organized crime. Willie also comes to rob George of his prize winnings from the previous fight, but George knocks him cold. Dolans dead body is found in the river. George schemes to turn Guido and Healy against one another, resulting in them exchanging gunfire after the fight. Miss Gormley likes the way George has handled himself and they look like a perfect match.
