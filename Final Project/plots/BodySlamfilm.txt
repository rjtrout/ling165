M. Harry Smilac (Dirk Benedict), once a successful music promoter, is having a hard time attracting talent and booking gigs for his sole client, the rock band Kicks. Behind on his car payments and owing a large amount to a banker, he reluctantly accepts a job finding musical acts for the fundraiser of an unpopular politician. Although not entirely happy with his new gig, Smilac finds a love interest in Candace Vandervagen (Tanya Roberts), the daughter of the politicians wealthy campaign booster. While making arrangements for the fundraiser, Smilac mistakes pro wrestler Rick Roberts (Roddy Piper) for a musician and hires him. Having zero luck as a music manager, Smilac decides to stick with his hunch about Roberts and become a pro wrestling manager, booking matches for Roberts and his teammate Tonga Tom (Sam Fatu). The team is a success but politics come into play when Smilac clashes with Ricks former manager, the villainous Captain Lou Murano (Lou Albano). A day after a disastrous fundraiser featuring Smilacs rock band, Murano and his tag team champions The Cannibals (Sione Vailahi and Tom Cassett) injure Harry and his wrestlers in a nationally televised bout, before blacklisting them from every major arena in the country. Recovering from their injuries and on the fringes of both the music and wrestling industries, Harry decides to take his wrestlers and his band on a cross country road tour of small arenas. Initially he promotes separate wrestling and rock shows, but a scheduling mix-up at a venue causes him to promote a single event featuring both music and wrestling. The show is well received and Smilac schedules an entire tour using the same "Rock n Wrestling" format. Their tour is a huge success and inspires Harry, Roberts and Tonga to win a hard fought rematch against Muranos Cannibals.
