In a small Indiana town in the mid-1910s, the Winfield household – banker father George, his wife Alice, their grown tomboyish daughter Marjorie, their precocious trouble-making son Wesley, and their exasperated housekeeper Stella – have just moved into a larger house in a nicer neighborhood. No one but George is happy about the move, until Marjorie meets their new neighbor, William Sherman, home on a break from his studies at the University of Indiana. The two are immediately attracted to each other, which makes Margie change her focus from baseball to trying to become a proper young woman. Their resulting relationship is despite, or perhaps because of Bills unconventional thoughts on life, including not believing in the institution of marriage, or believing in the role money plays in society. The road to a happy life between Margie and Bill is not only hindered by distance as Bill returns to school and Margies attempts to learn feminine things, but also Georges dislike of Bill because of their differing beliefs, the stuffy Hubert Wakely also trying to court Margie (he who is Georges choice as an appropriate suitor for her), Wesleys continual meddling in his sisters life, and World War I. One of those issues may be overcome when Wesley receives a gift from Aunt Martha that used to be his father old slingshot that he used to kill Aunt Marthas best hen. His father discovers the old slingshot after Wesley cracks a window with it, his father gets emotional after he sees it and everything is resolved in time for a happy ending.
