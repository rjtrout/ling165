Aboard a luxury liner sailing for Cuba are a band of struggling musicians led by Steve Morrison along with a number of swindlers, one named Beheegan and another a pair of con artists passing themselves off as Se√±or and Rosita Alvarez, phony names. Another passenger is Madame La Zonga, whose nightclub in Havana has been closed. She is looking for money to put the club back in business, but must avoid being fleeced by her shipmates and also must avoid the police, who are waiting for the boat at the dock. She disguises herself as a steward to disembark safely. Alvarez attempts to have "Rosita" sing at the club, but eventually are arrested for their nefarious schemes. Madame La Zonga has a successful grand reopening, with Steve and his band the featured performers.
