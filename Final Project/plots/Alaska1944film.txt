Gary Corbett kills a pair of claim jumpers who did likewise to his father. He is charged with murder, but cannot be taken to Juneau to stand trial until the weather permits. Marshal John Masters keeps him in town until the prisoner can be moved. Roxie Reagan, who sings at Tom LaRues saloon, falls in love with Corbett, but she is trapped in a loveless marriage to John Reagan, an alcoholic has-been actor. LaRue also is in love with Roxie, and he and a local judge are suspected by Corbett of being in cahoots with the claim jumpers. LaRue tries to frame Corbett for another murder, then sets the jail on fire. John Reagan courageously comes to Corbetts rescue, losing his own life in the process. The marshal deals with LaRue, but suddenly reveals that he is the one who has been backing the murderous claim jumpers all along. Corbett manages to get the better of Masters, then sets sail for San Francisco with his bride-to-be, Roxie.
