When Catherine Terriss (Virginia Mayo) career in Hollywood hits the skids, she heads back to the site of her first great triumphs...Broadway! She takes the lead in a play which is being directed by Rick Sommers (Steve Cochran), the man who was both her Svengali and her lover. Sommers is still bitter that she walked out on him to become the toast of Hollywood years earlier. Can Terris and Sommers put aside their mutual animosity long enough to make a go of this production? After the way things start off, it doesnt seem likely.
