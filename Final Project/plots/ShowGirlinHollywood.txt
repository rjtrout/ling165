When the film begins, a musical show before closed down before it has had a chance to even open. Jimmie Doyle (Jack Mulhall), who wrote the musical intends to rewrite it while his girlfriend, Dixie Dugan (Alice White), fed up at wasting her time for a show that never even opened, is intent on finding a new career. While at a nightclub, Dixie does a musical number and catches the eye of Frank Buelow (John Miljan), a Hollywood director. Buelow persuades Dixie to go to Hollywood, where he will have a part waiting for her in his upcoming films. Dixie takes the next train to California. When she arrives, she is disappointed to find that Buelow has been fired from the studio and that there is no part for her. Dixie meets Donny Harris (Blanche Sweet), a former star who is now out of work because she is considered "as old as the hills" at the age of 32. Soon after, Dixie discovers that Jimmie Doyle is now in Hollywood because one of the movie studios had just bought the film rights to his musical play. Jimmie had insisted that Dixie be given the lead in the film version of his play. The film goes into production and Dixie manages to get Donny included in the cast. One day, Dixie meets Frank Buelow at a restaurant and tells her that he is now working for another studio. Through his influence, Buelow manages to change Dixie into a temperamental and conceited actress and this leads to complications which almost end her film career.
