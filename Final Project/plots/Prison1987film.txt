In 1964, inmate Charlie Forsythe of Creedmore Prison was executed via electric chair for a murder he did not commit. When Creedmore Prison is reopened after thirty years, Charlie Forsythe returns from the afterlife to exact revenge on Eaton Sharpe (Lane Smith) â€“ the officer who stood by as Forsythe was executed. Inmate Burke (Viggo Mortensen) and all other inmates soon realize that they will all be slaughtered unless Forsythe is allowed to repay his long-standing debt.
