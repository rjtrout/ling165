Michael, nicknamed Fresh (portrayed by Sean Nelson), is a 12-year-old kid running drugs for gangsters, notably Esteban (Giancarlo Esposito). Inspired by the chess lessons of his father, an alcoholic speed-chess master (Samuel L. Jackson), Fresh devises and executes a brilliant plan to extricate himself and his drug-addicted sister (NBushe Wright) from their hopeless lives.
