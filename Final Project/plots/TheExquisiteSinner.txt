The film concerns a young Frenchman (Conrad Nagel) who forsakes the humdrum business world for the bohemian life of an artist. Renee Adoree co-stars as "The Gypsy Maid" who leads the hero merrily astray. Myrna Loy makes a brief, barely clothed appearance as "The Living Statue," the first of von Sternbergs many beautiful "mannequins."
