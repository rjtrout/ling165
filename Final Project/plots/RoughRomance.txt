Working as lumberjacks in the Northwest, Billy West (George OBrien) and his pal Laramie (Eddie Borden) spy two men stealing furs from a trap, but they arrive too late to save the trap owner from being shot. Billy suspects Loup LaTour (Antonio Moreno) and his partner Chick Carson (Harry Cording). While Marna Reynolds (Helen Chandler) dreams of dances and pick chiffon dresses, her father (David Hartford) is being forced to purchase stolen furs from LaTour and Carson, and LaTour is throwing a few lecherous glances toward Marna. Billy, in a card game, catches LaTour cheating and also suggests he suspects him of theft and murder before further violence is stopped by the sheriff. Billy and Laramie are ambushed and Billy is shot in the shoulder, but kills Carson. Laramie takes Billy to the Reynolds trading post, where Marna ministers to his wound. LaTour convinces the sheriff that Billy murdered Carson and the sheriff is led on a dogsled chase by Laramie. LaTour returns to the post with intentions of changing his lecherous glances into lecherous action, and the weakened Billy struggles with LaTour as Marna races toward the log-jammed river.
