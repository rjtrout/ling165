In 1876, Lin McAdam (James Stewart) and friend Frankie High-Spade Wilson (Millard Mitchell) pursue outlaw Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) into Dodge City, Kansas. McAdam enters a shooting competition against Brown, winning a coveted "One of One Thousand" Winchester 1873 rifle. Brown promptly steals it, and McAdam pursues him, and the rifle, for the rest of the film. In a climactic shootout, McAdam shoots and kills Brown, who is revealed to be McAdams brother.
