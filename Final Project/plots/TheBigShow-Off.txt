Nightclub pianist Sandy Elliott is madly in love with nightclub singer June Mayfield, who ignores his existence, preferring the obnoxious Wally Porter, the nightclub emcee. Sandy follows June to discover to his disgust that she is a big fan of professional wrestling. Sandys friend Joe the night club owner decides to make the shy Sandy attractive to June by paying a thug to disrupt Junes singing, then being thrown out by Sandy. Joe adds fuel to Junes new, smoldering love for Sandy by making her promise not to tell a secret: that Sandy is really the masked wrestler known as "The Devil".
