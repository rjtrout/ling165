Tommy McCabe (Dennis Morgan) is a cocky nightclub singer who gets his jollies out of making fun of the local police force. In fact, his act includes a parody of a policeman. This does not prove amusing to pretty Jerry Sullivan (Gloria Dickson), the daughter of a police lieutenant (Harry Shannon), nor to Jerrys flatfoot boyfriend Bill Morrissey (John Payne). Falling in love with Jerry himself, Tommy joins the police force, where he is subject to the rigorous training program applied by Morrissey. Eventually suspended from the police because of his carelessness, Tommy ends up saving the day by saving Morriseys life. Tommy is finally reinstated in the force, thus rewarding Jerrys faith in him.
