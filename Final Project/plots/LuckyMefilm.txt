Candy Williams (Doris Day) is a member of a struggling Vaudeville troupe that is stranded in Miami when creditors take all their money. After the troupes leader Hap Schneider (Phil Silvers) tries to scam a restaurant out of dinner, they are forced to work in the hotel to pay for the meal. While cleaning a hallway, Flo Neely (Nancy Walker) hears Dick Carson (Robert Cummings) singing songs that are for his new Broadway show. She tells Hap and Duke McGee (Eddie Foy Jr.) that Dick is staying in the hotel. Candy has met Dick but believes he is a mechanic named Eddie. She arranges a date with him and is enjoying it when Hap joins them and spills the beans about Eddie being Dick Carson. Candy leaves thinking that Dick was trying to take advantage of her. To make up for the trouble he caused, Hap arranges a rehearsal of a new song so Dick can watch the troupe and audition Candy for his show. However, Candy thinks he is just trying to trick her again. He convinces her that he really wants her to star in the play. But his backers daughter Lorraine Thayer (Martha Hyer) is jealous and says she will not let her father back Dicks show if Candy is in it. The troupe is leaving the hotel when Dicks manager reveals he is giving up the show and going back to New York. Candy realizes that Dick really loves her. She returns to her room and disguises herself to get into Otis Thayers (Bill Goodwin) birthday party to perform Dicks songs and get Thayers backing for the show. The troupe goes along and gets Lorraine out of the way so Candy can save the day.
