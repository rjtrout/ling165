Buck Randall (Buck Jones), a carefree cowboy whose popularity with the local saloon girls becomes the talk of the town. The new marshal, Joseph Slyde (Russell Simpson), gets on Bucks bad side by enforcing a "no gun" rule. Buck returns the favor by falling in love with the marshals mistreated wife, Mary (Mary Doran), and she asks her husband for a divorce so she can marry Buck.
