Nine years after the events of the shows third season, former teenage sleuth Veronica Mars has left the fictional town of Neptune, California, and moved to New York City, where she is in a relationship with Stosh "Piz" Piznarski and has a job offer from the prestigious law firm Truman-Mann and Associates. She is contacted by her ex-boyfriend Logan Echolls, now a Lieutenant in the United States Navy, who has been accused of murdering his girlfriend Carrie Bishop, a fellow Neptune High student who became a self-destructive pop star under the stage name "Bonnie DeVille". He is being bombarded for offers of representation from lawyers, and Veronica agrees to return to Neptune and help Logan find one who will best represent him. She reunites with her father Keith Mars, Neptunes former sheriff-turned-private investigator, who shows her how corruption and classism are rife under Sheriff Dan Lamb. Veronica investigates the circumstances of Carries death. During her investigation, she is dragged to her ten-year high school reunion by friends Wallace Fennell and Cindy "Mac" MacKenzie. There, she learns that former outlaw biker Eli "Weevil" Navarro is now a reformed family man. During the reunion, Veronica realizes Carries murder is connected to the death of Carries best friend, Susan Knight, who disappeared off a boat at sea nine years earlier. After Veronicas nemesis Madison Sinclair plays a copy of Veronicas college sex tape with Piz, a fight breaks out. The reunion comes to an abrupt end as Veronica sets the sprinklers off. She attends an after party and speaks with Dick Casablancas; Luke Haldeman and his fianc√©e Gia Goodman; and Stu "Cobb" Cobbler, all of whom were with Susan and Carrie on the boat the night Susan disappeared. Meanwhile, while driving home from the reunion, Weevil stops to help a driver being harassed by bikers, only to be shot by the driver, a nervous Celeste Kane. The sheriffs department plants a gun so that Celeste can claim self-defense, and Keith agrees to prove Weevils innocence. Veronica concludes that those on Susans boat nine years ago covered up the circumstances of her death and that someone killed Carrie because she threatened to confess. Compromising videos of Carrie are posted online, and Veronica traces them back to Vinnie Van Lowe, who has been planting spyware on celebrities and selling the footage. Veronica uses Vinnies footage to prove Gia lured Logan out to Carries home the night of her murder, suggesting that she and Luke killed Carrie and framed Logan. Lamb ignores her evidence and refuses to follow up, but unbeknownst to him Veronica records the conversation. Having stayed in Neptune longer than planned, Veronica calls Piz in New York to explain that she cannot return yet, and Piz breaks off their relationship. Truman-Mann rescinds their job offer, which results in an argument between Keith and Veronica about what shes doing with her life. Keith has a clandestine meeting with Deputy Sacks about Weevils case, but they are attacked by an unknown driver in a truck who slams into Sacks car, killing him and leaving Keith in critical condition. Veronica and Logan sleep together, reaffirming their relationship. Veronica sends bugged flowers to Gias apartment and calls her, playing recordings of Carries voice, hoping to scare Gia into confessing to being the mastermind behind Carries death. Gia panics and calls Cobb, revealing his involvement. Veronica goes to Gias apartment to confront her, where Gia reveals that Cobb is the mastermind of Carries death and framing Logan: Susan overdosed, and he took photos of a panicked Carrie, Gia, and Luke dumping Susans body and has been blackmailing them. Veronicas bug broadcasts everything via a radio frequency which she believed to be unused but is actually that of a local radio station. Cobb hears their conversation over the radio from his apartment in the building opposite, then shoots and kills Gia through the window before coming after Veronica. She calls the police and lures Cobb to the basement before beating him unconscious with a golf club. Logan returns to active duty in the Navy but promises to come back to Veronica. Cobbs photo and the secret recording of Lamb refusing to investigate Veronicas claims leak online, forcing Lamb to arrest Cobb, with calls to oust Lamb from office. Keith and Weevil recover from their injuries, but Weevil returns to the criminal lifestyle. Veronica takes over her fathers private investigator business with Mac as her assistant, resolved to help fight Neptunes corruption.
