Drifter Johnny Moon (William Shatner) is frequently attacked as he is mistaken for his twin brother Notah who leads Comanche war parties in attacks on the white population whilst he is having visions on peyote. Johnny travels to a Comanche encampment where he challenges his brother to a fight to the death in the town of Rio Honcho. When Johnny rides into Rio Honcho he finds the town is at boiling point between two warring factions with only Sheriff Lomax (Joseph Cotten) keeping the peace. One of the factions discovers Johnnyâ€™s prowess with his six gun and tries to hire him. Johnny says he will give his answer in four days, after the climax with his brother.
