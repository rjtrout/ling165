Joe Grange quits his job as a Los Angeles accountant and gambles the last of his savings on a racehorse. He literally gambles as well, winning $2,000 at one point, then losing it all when his cab driver friend Toby Gleeton bets it all on the favorite rather than on Joes longshot of a horse, Gallant Man. Toby has helped introduce Joe to the love of his life, Ronnie Moore, who puts up with Joes gambling for a while. But when she expects a child, even Joes winning of a house doesnt make her trust his ways. Joe is too busy playing poker to be there when son Richard is born, and hes suckered by horse trainer John Ramsey into betting $40,000 on a race, blowing it all. Having lost his wife and money, Joe is desperate to put things right. When he hears Ronnie is entering Gallant Man in a $100,000 race at Hollywood Park, he tries to stop her before she loses everything. It turns out she knew exactly what she was doing, and even forgives Joe after their horses victory.
