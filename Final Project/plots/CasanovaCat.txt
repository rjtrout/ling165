A newspaper headline announces that Toodles has inherited a million dollars. Tom heads to her home to woo her with flowers, dragging Jerry, tied to a bow, with him. Tom winds Jerry into a doll and forces him to roll on a ball, impressing Toodles. Tom then blackens Jerrys face with a cigar smoke and forces him to tap-dance on a hot metal plate. Tom then gives Jerry as a present to Toodles, but asks for a kiss in return. Just as Tom and Toodles are about to kiss, Jerry jams Toms tail into an automatic ashtray, causing Tom to scream in Toodles face. Jerry spots Butch in a nearby alley and launches the newspaper headline towards Butch. Tom and Butch proceed to fight each other to win Toodles heart, while Toodles, sitting on the couch, watches them. Tom slaps Butch, but he slaps Tom into a fishbowl, causing Tom to ties Butchs tail to a pole. Toodles then tosses sweets into Toms mouth, but Butch drops a bowling ball into Tom. Butch kisses Toodles arm, but Tom places a mousetrap onto her arm to trap Butchs mouth. Tom then traps Butch between two doors and kisses Toodles cheek. Butch then grabs Toodles and goes to kiss her, but Tom also turns around to also kiss Toodles, and the two kiss each other instead. Jerry then kisses Toodles on the cheek, causing her to take an interest in Jerry. Tom and Butch chase Jerry, but Jerry hides in a vent, ties Butch and Toms tails into a knot, and pulls their tails to make them pull each other into the wall repeatedly. Butch then runs forward, squeezing Tom through the vent. Tom then pops out of the vent as a cube and bangs into Butch. Then they untangle themselves. Afterwards, they looked on the couch for Toodles. However, they heard a noise outside. They run to the window to look at what is happening and see a car leaving. Toodles and Jerry are in the back seats, then after Jerry has put down the shade in the car, he and Toodles share a passionate kiss.
