Set in 1978 Chicago, Roll Bounce tells the story of a boy named Xavier (Bow Wow) (nicknamed "X") whose mother has passed, leaving him with his father, Curtis (Chi McBride) and his sister, Sonya. After the local roller rink closes down, X and his friends are forced to skate in the ritzy uptown rink "Sweetwater". Tired of being disrespected by the skate rental distributor (Nick Cannon) and other skaters at Sweetwater, the group enters a roller disco contest. Their biggest rivals are the 5-year champion, Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan) and his crew, the Sweetwater Rollers. The film centers on Xs training for the competition while trying to work through problems with his father and his pretty childhood friend, Naomi (Meagan Good). In the end, it not only comes down to gaining the respect of others, but also learning to respect themselves and giving roller disco their all.
