Steve Giardino, an abrasive, workaholic Wall Streeter, and his wife Jackie divorce after twenty-six years of marriage and find themselves thrust back into the dating world in middle age and in search of a new life. Steves fellow trader, Mel Arons, likes being single and chasing women, encouraging Steve to join him, with disastrous results at first. Jackie, starved for affection, is at first thrilled by the romantic interest of a man called Doc, only to end up smothered by his attentions and in desperate need of some private space. Unwilling to stop smoking and drinking or to eat properly, Steve has a mild heart attack. He ends up falling for his doctor, Kay Hutton, but a rift develops when he insists that he is too old to father her children and begin a new family.
