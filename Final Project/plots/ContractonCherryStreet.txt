When his partner is gunned down, Frank Hovannes, a detective inspector with the New York police department, wants to lead his organized-crime unit against the mob. Legal and departmental restrictions inhibit him, so Hovannes decides to take the matter into his own hands. A vigilante act, a contract hit against one of the crime syndicates members, is designed to stir the mob into action so that Hovannes and his men can catch them in the act. He runs into strong objections from his superiors in the police force along the way.
