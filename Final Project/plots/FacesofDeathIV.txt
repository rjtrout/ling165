Much like its three predecessors, Faces of Death IV provides scenes of dying, murder, accidents, police brutality, execution, cult rituals, and other macabre events. Some of these include a bungee jumping trip gone awry, a magicians fatal mishap with a Houdini trick, a wrecking yard worker who has his left leg severed by a falling Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, a Satanic ritual that ends in the death of several, a cocaine dealers fatal wedding, and more. John Alan Schwartz cameos yet again as an ambulance driver. The earlier films in the series were of a more serious nature and tone, whereas this installment leans more toward camp: "Dr. Louis Flellis" sits at his desk in front of a glowing red lava lamp, with a plastic skeletal foot on the desk in front of him during introductions to most sequences. Flellis is also shown eating a plate of barbecue ribs immediately before showing slaughterhouse footage.
