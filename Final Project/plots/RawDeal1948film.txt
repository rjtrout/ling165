Prison convict Joe Sullivan (Dennis OKeefe) has "taken the fall" for an unspecified $50,000 crime but breaks out of jail with the help of his girl Pat (Claire Trevor). Neither is aware that the escape has been facilitated by their former accomplice Rick Coyle (Raymond Burr), a sadistic mobster, who has arranged for Joe to be killed in order to avoid paying Joe his share of the $50,000 take. When the break-out succeeds, Rick decides that he must have Joe killed some other way. Pat and Joe kidnap his legal caseworker, Ann (Marsha Hunt), who has been visiting Joe in prison, trying to reform him. This begins a doomed love triangle. Ann shoots one of Ricks henchmen (John Ireland) in the back to stop him attacking and fighting with Joe. After acting in Joes defense this way, Ann realizes she is in love with him. Relenting, Joe sets her free and prepares to flee the country with Pat. In their hotel room, Pat receives a phone call warning them that Rick has seized Ann and will harm her unless Joe and Pat come out of hiding. Pat does not want Joe to go back to Ann, so lies about the call, saying it was from the hotel desk clerk about their checkout time. After boarding a ship, Joe attempts to convince Pat that they can start a new life in South America together. He even proposes marriage to her. A guilt-stricken Pat now confesses to Joe that Ann has been abducted by Rick. Joe races to save Ann from her captor. Under the cover of a thick fog, Joe manages to get past Ricks henchmen and sneaks into Ricks room. A gunfight erupts with Rick and Joe shooting each other and inadvertently starting a fire. Joe and Rick, both wounded, fight hand-to-hand with Joe finally pushing Rick through an upper story window to his death. Mortally wounded and lying in the street, Joe dies in Anns arms as Pat looks on. Seeing the resigned contentment in Joes face, Pat comments in voice-over that: "This is right for Joe. This is what he wanted."
