Thelma Jordon shows up late one night in the office of assistant district attorney Cleve Marshall, a married man, who would rather get drunk than go home. She tells him a story about prowlers and burglars. He asks her to join him for a drink and she agrees. Before Cleve can stop himself, he and Thelma are involved in a love affair. But Thelma is a mysterious woman, and Cleve cant help wondering if she is hiding something. When her rich Aunt Vera is found shot, Thelma calls Cleve rather than the police, and he helps her cover up evidence that may incriminate her, but he believes her story that an intruder killed the aunt. When she emerges as the prime suspect, and is arrested for murder, Marshall is in a unique position to help her due to his job. He therefore persuades the prosecution that a "reasonable doubt" exists due to evidence of an elusive "Mr X" (which he believes is Thelmas estranged husband). Thelma Jordon is acquitted. Her past, however, has begun to catch up with her. Tony, her husband, rematerialises. She tells him she has successfully manipulated Cleve. She does not love him but he loves her. Cleve appears and Thelma acknowledges that there is a relationship with Tony Laredo, who conceived the scheme for her to commit murder and inherit Veras jewels and money. Unable to deal with her guilty conscience, Jordon causes a car accident that results in her accomplices death and her own fatal injury. As she lies dying, Jordon confesses the truth to the district attorney. However, she does not incriminate Cleve, saying she cannot reveal his name because she loves him. Cleve nevertheless tenders his resignation.
