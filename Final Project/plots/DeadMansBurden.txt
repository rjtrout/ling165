Martha (Clare Bowen) and her husband Heck (David Call) are two hardy settlers trying to survive in New Mexico after the end of the Civil War and the death of Marthas father. Theyre given hope for a better life when a mining company shows interest in purchasing their homestead, but things become tense when Marthas brother Wade (Barlow Jacobs), who defected to the Union Army returns home after hearing of their fathers death- unaware that Martha herself was the one who brought about his demise.
