Dixie Dugan, a Brooklyn cutie, goes to the offices of theatrical producers Eppus and Kibbitzer and exposes her perfections in a bathing suit. Eppus and Kibbitzer express interest in her future and arrange for her to work in a nightclub act with Álvarez Romano. One evening Dixie accompanies wealthy sugardaddy Jack Milton to his apartment, and Álvarez stalks in and wounds Milton with a knife. Jimmy Doyle, a cynical tabloid reporter in love with Dixie, gets the story for his newspapers front page. Dixie is then kidnaped by Álvarez, but quickly manages to free herself. Jimmy persuades her to hide low as a publicity stunt and puts the "kidnaping" on page one. Dixie is found by Milton, who, by way of apology for ruining her stunt, finances her in a Broadway show written by Jimmy. The show is a success, and Jimmy and Dixie are married.
