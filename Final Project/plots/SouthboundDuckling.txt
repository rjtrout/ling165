Quacker, convinced that all ducks fly South for the winter, packs his suitcase, visits Jerry to tell him about his migration plans, and tries to leave, but the mouse stops him, showing Quacker a book on ducks to convince him that only wild ducks fly south, and domestic ducks like Quacker do not. Quacker, unconvinced, leaves, but quickly becomes out of breath running, and Jerry again shows his friend the book. Quacker refuses to give up, using a catapult, but flies straight into Toms mouth. Jerry pulls Quacker into a tree to evade Tom, who aims to capture Quacker for a duck recipe. Quacker then places himself onto a seesaw and uses an anvil to launch himself into the air, but he struggles and lands into a frying pan Tom sticks out of the window. Tom covers Quacker with egg and flour, but Jerry grabs Quacker with a spatula and pulls him towards his hole. The duck crashes into the wall, but Jerry hits Toms hand with the spatula to recover him. Quacker then rides a rocket into the distance, but Tom swallows the rocket instead, and the cat rockets into a pool. Quacker, after much pleading, persuades Jerry to keep helping him. The mouse inflates a balloon and the duck boards it, sending Quacker floating into the air, but Tom, with a shotgun, shoots the balloon. Tom tries to catch the duck with a net, but Jerry cuts the net. Carrying Quacker, the mouse and duck escape and board a plane to Miami, Florida, but Tom follows, clinging onto the planes wheel. Quacker and Jerry finally sunbathe on a Miami beach, glad to be rid of Tom. However, Tom then appears, having been already hiding under the sand at their campsite, and traps the duo under a bucket. The short ends with Quacker screaming helplessly from inside the bucket as Tom pulls down a parasol to hide himself, snickering in victory and the words The End appear on it.
