The film features Elliott Smith playing acoustic songs. These include: an instrumental based on what became "Baby Britain", at the beginning and between the last two songs; "Between the Bars"; "Thirteen" (Big Star cover); and "Angeles". In an MTV "indie outing" interview, Smith described it as "a cross between a video and a documentary, but actually being neither of the two."
