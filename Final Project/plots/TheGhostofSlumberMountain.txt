Most of the full plot is unknown. In the version available today, Holmes (Dawley) tells his nephews and children about an adventure he had in the woodlands around Slumber Mountain, near the Valley of Dreams. He finds the cabin belonging to the late hermit Mad Dick, who Holmess friend Joe once saw carrying a strange telescope-like instrument. That night, Holmes searches the cabin and finds the instrument. Upon doing so, the ghost of Mad Dick (OBrien) instructs him to use it to look at the peak of Slumber Mountain. When he does, he seemingly looks back into the past, seeing a Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops doing battle. The Tyrannosaurus proves triumphant, and after killing the Triceratops, breaks the time barrier and begins chasing Holmes. It is then revealed that Holmes dreamed everything. The children then tackle him for thinking of a good tall tale.
