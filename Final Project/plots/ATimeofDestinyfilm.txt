Soldiers Martin (William Hurt) and Jack (Timothy Hutton) are very good friends during World War II. While their friendship grows, they do not realize they are brothers-in-law. Martin eventually learns that Jack is married to his sister Josie (Melissa Leo). When Jack and Josie elope, Jorge (Francisco Rabal), her Basque immigrant father, tracks them down and abducts his daughter in order to dominate her with his "old-world" notions of marriage. However, when Jorge Larraneta drowns in a lake after an auto accident, Martin (the black-sheep of the family) returns home and learns of his fathers death. He vows revenge after he learns his buddy Jack has become his sworn enemy. Martin gets himself assigned to Jacks infantry platoon in Italy in order to seek vengeance.
