Becoming mining partners after first getting into a fistfight, two men strike uranium pay dirt in remote Colorado. Grady (William Talman) guards the claim while Brad (Dennis Morgan) returns to town to register their find. Unfortunately, Brad is distracted by a young beautiful woman from Denver and quickly marries her, before he realizes she has a past with his partner, who doesnt take the news well. Vowing to ruin Brad any way he can, Grady begins by giving his half-share of the mine to Jean Williams (Patricia Medina), his former sweetheart, in an attempt to win her back. When that fails, Grady spreads a rumor that the railroad is erecting a spur near the uranium mine. The greed-driven Brad sinks all his money into preparing for the train, then ends up broke when he discovers the truth. But when he realizes Jean wont leave Brad no matter what, Grady shrugs it off and agrees to become partners with him once again.
