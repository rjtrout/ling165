Attorney Alan Ward (Paul Page) is fed up with the reckless behavior of spoiled heiress Kay Elliott (Alice White) – the daughter of the head of his law firm – who is in love with him. Stung by his rejection, she eventually tells him to "Go jump in the lake." Seeing a chance to make up the money they lost in the stock market crash, a fortune-hunting brother and sister, Jack and Linda Gregory (Douglas Gilmore and Myrna Loy), get Kay to agree to marry Jack. At the altar, she announces that she still loves Alan, and he comes to his senses and realizes he loves her too.
