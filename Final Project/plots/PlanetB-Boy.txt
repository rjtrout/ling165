Planet B-Boy features extensive footage of the dancers in competition as well as street performances and various rehearsals by the different crews from around the world. The narrative of the film centers on five particular crews (representing France, Japan, South Korea, and the United States) in their quest to win the Battle of the Year, and it includes multiple interviews with the B-Boys and their families. The film also includes interviews with German B-Boy and promoter Thomas Hergenr√∂ther (who founded the Battle of the Year competition) and legendary B-Boy Ken Swift of the Rock Steady Crew. This film has been shown at numerous festivals around the world after originally making its debut on April 26, 2007 at the Tribeca Film Festival. Planet B-Boy has received many strong reviews and currently has a 91% rating at Rotten Tomatoes - with the consensus that "Lees dazzling documentary makes a compelling argument for breakdancing as an art form". In March 2008 it was revealed that director Benson Lee was working on a feature adaptation of Planet B-Boy, starring Chris Brown and featuring many American b-boys such as Kid David from Renegades and Casper from Boogie Brats.
