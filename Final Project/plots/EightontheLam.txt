Bank teller Henry Dimsdale (Bob Hope) finds ten $1,000 bills. He is a widower with seven kids and could use the money, and housekeeper Golda (Phyllis Diller) tells him its a case of finders keepers. Henry waits two weeks to see if anyone claims the missing money. No one does, so he splurges on a new car and a diamond ring for Ellie Barton (Shirley Eaton), his fiancee. But when the bank discovers a $50,000 shortage, Henry becomes a prime suspect. He, his family and Ellie take it on the lam to Arizona. A detective, Jasper Lynch (Jonathan Winters), the boyfriend of Golda, is assigned to investigate. Henrys boss at the bank, Pomeroy (Austin Willis), is seen with a sexy younger woman, Monica (Jill St. John), who has expensive tastes. After a chase, Henry is placed under arrest. His kids hide a tape recorder in Pomeroys pocket, though, and get an admission of guilt. That frees their dad to marry Ellie while the helpful Golda and Jasper do likewise.
