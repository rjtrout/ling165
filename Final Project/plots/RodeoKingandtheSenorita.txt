Pablo Morales, part-owner of the Foster & Morales Wild West Show, is killed during a stunt on horseback. Steve Lacey plans to replace him in management and in the act, so he is irate at learning Rex Allen is going to be the shows new star. Pablos young daughter Juanita takes an immediate liking to Rex and his talented horse, Koko. But when another accident results in a broken leg for Koko that could prove fatal for the horse, Rex and his sidekick Muscles Benton suspect foul play. Koko recovers thanks to the care of Juanita and her governess, Janet Wells, and Rex feels he should give the horse to the girl. After a fight with Lacey, he intends to leave until he learns that Juanita, now the shows co-owner, has just $2,000 left. After a lab analysis proves the chicanery involved, Foster shoots a sheriff, but Rex manages to make sure the guilty parties both end up behind bars. A grateful Juanita feels that Kokos rightful place is with Rex.
