The film follows Dr. Hess Green (Duane Jones), a wealthy black anthropologist who is doing research on the Myrthians, an ancient African nation of blood drinkers. One night, while staying in Greens lavish mansion, richly decorated with African art, his unstable assistant George Meda (writer/director Gunn) threatens suicide. Green successfully talks him down, but later that night Meda attacks and stabs Green with a Myrthian ceremonial dagger, and then kills himself. Green survives, but on discovering the body, drinks Medas blood; he has become a vampire endowed with immortality and a need for fresh blood. Though he steals several bags of blood from a doctors office, he finds that he needs fresh victims. Soon, Medas estranged wife, Ganja Meda (Marlene Clark), arrives at Greens house searching for her husband. Green and Meda quickly become lovers, and she moves into Greens expansive mansion. When she unwittingly discovers her husbands corpse frozen in Greens wine cellar she is initially upset, but then agrees to marry her host, who turns her into a vampire as well. Ganja is initially horrified by her new existence, but Green teaches her how to survive. Soon, he brings a young man home, who Ganja seduces and then kills. The two vampires dispose of the body in the water. Eventually, Green becomes disillusioned of this life and resolves to return to the Christian church headed by his chauffeur (Sam Waymon). Returning home, he kills himself by standing in front of a cross. Ganja, though saddened by his death, lives on, presumably continuing her vampiric lifestyle. The film ends with the young man Ganja had earlier killed rising out of the water, naked but alive, and running towards her.
