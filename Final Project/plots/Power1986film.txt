Pete St. John (Richard Gere), a ruthless and highly successful media consultant, is juggling a couple of other political candidates when asked to join the campaign of wealthy but little-known Ohio businessman Jerome Cade (J. T. Walsh), who hopes to win the Senate seat being vacated by St. Johns friend Sam Hastings (E. G. Marshall). He comes into conflict with Arnold Billings (Denzel Washington), a public relations expert whose firm Cade has hired. St. Johns investigation into Cades background prompts Billings to retaliate by bugging St. Johns office phones, flooding the basement of his headquarters, tampering with his private jet, and interfering with his other clients. These actions force St. John to take a hard look at himself and what he has become and to decide whether his ex-wife Ellen Freeman (Julie Christie) and his former partner Wilfred Buckley (Gene Hackman) are right in believing that his success is due primarily to the exploitation of others.
