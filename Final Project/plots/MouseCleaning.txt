While chasing Jerry in the garden, Tom runs through a mud puddle and then into the house, leaving the kitchen floor covered in mud right after Mammy Two Shoes has finished cleaning. As punishment, Mammy makes Tom clean the floor and orders him to keep the house clean, before leaving to go shopping. Once she is gone, Jerry, wanting to sabotage Tom, begins making a mess around the house by, among other things, emptying the ashtray onto the floor, juggling food and pushing an ink stamp pad onto Toms paws while he takes a nap, causing the cat to leave a long trail of paw prints in the living room. Tom throws Jerry down the laundry chute into the basement and quickly cleans the room. As he does so, a coal truck arrives at the house to make a delivery, and Jerry uses a rope to pull the trucks delivery chute up to the living room window, causing the house to flood with coal. When Mammy returns from shopping and discovers this, she blames Tom, who flees. As he runs, Mammy throws lumps of coal at him, one of which knocks him out.
