As described in a film magazine, David Markelys (Dexter) affection for Ruth Anderson (Swanson) followed her from childhood and deepened with her womanhood. He is a young man of means but a cripple, while she is the daughter of a blacksmith. David persuades her father to allow him to have her educated. When she returns from school, the father realizes Davids attitude towards Ruth and plans their marriage. Ruth, against her fathers wishes, marries Jim Dirk (Blue), the young lover of her heart. A few years later Jim is killed in a subway accident. Ruth returns to her father for forgiveness but finds him blinded by the sparks from his forge and on the way to the county poorhouse. He is stubborn in his unforgiveness of her. She is about to take her own life when David rescues her, offering the protection of his name for her and the child that is about to be born to her. As his wife she eventually realizes a great love for him which he refuses to admit is anything but gratitude. The preachings of his housekeeper (McDowell) have an effect that brings about the reconciliation of Ruth and her father, and through the little boy Bobby (Moore) he becomes a member of the happy household.
