Pierre (Carroll), a singing French-Canadian trapper, acts as a non-commissioned law enforcement officer, punishing traveling salesman Clerou (Leonard) for "selling whiskey to Indians." When his intrusive nature gets him into trouble with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, he is brought to the station. In order to avoid incarceration, he claims that he is engaged to be married to the lovely Daisy Denton (Hussey), a popular barmaid who runs the local saloon, but who is actually engaged to "Jap" Durkin (Cabot). After Pierres shrewd planning destroys the possibly of a marriage to Daisy, Durkin vows revenge. Meanwhile, Pierre spends his time romancing Daisy and simultaneously getting into scrapes with the mounties. While riding horseback en route to town and back to his rural campsite, he often breaks into the song "Saskatchewan." Daisys brother Val (Brown) shoots "Clerou" and is placed under arrest by Durkin. Through mutual conspiring on the part of Pierre and Daisy, they manage to help Val escape from jail, where the four of them hideout at Pierres rural campsite. Durkin finds them and confronts Pierre, resulting in a gunfire battle that kills Durkin. After a very brief investigation, Pierre marries Daisy and rides off for their honeymoon, singing "Saskatchewan."
