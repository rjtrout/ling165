Marguerites finances are covered by the wealthy Baron de Varville (Henry Daniell), but after many years of making money from her looks, she falls in love with Armand (Robert Taylor), a handsome young man. Armand loves Marguerite and shes prepared to give up the Baron and be with Armand. However, Armands father (Lionel Barrymore) begs Marguerite to turn away from his son, knowing her past will ruin his future in Paris. Realizing the painful wisdom of his advice, Marguerite rejects Armand, who continues to pursue her even as she contracts a serious case of tuberculosis.
