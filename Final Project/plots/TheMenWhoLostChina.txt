As todays China is gaining its undisputed superpower status, the world press still speculates over its intentions. The documentary suggests that any worthy prediction must be rooted in the diligent study of past events and the comprehension of the Western and Chinese perception of these events. The US involvement in the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and the perceived Western betrayal in the aftermath of First World War are the two most pivotal points in Chinese modern history that the documentary examines, subtitled into English, Chinese, and Spanish.
