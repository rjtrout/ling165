The story involves Arbuckle as a farm boy marrying his sweetheart, Normand. They have their honeymoon with Fattys dog Luke, at a cottage on the seashore. At high tide that night, Al St. John (Fattys rival) and his confederates set the cottage adrift. Fatty and Mabel awaken the next morning to find themselves surrounded by water in their bedroom, and the house afloat.
