David and Jason are estranged brothers, the former a depressive living with his grandfather in Philadelphia where he runs a late-night radio talk show and the latter an extrovert con man working for gang boss Lewis in Atlantic City, where he lives with the manic-depressive Sally, former beauty queen and prostitute, and her stepdaughter Jessica. Begging David to come to Atlantic City and bail him out of jail, Jason once freed persuades him to stay on in his hotel suite with the two women. Tensions grow between the four as Jason pursues a ludicrous dream of conning a Japanese syndicate into buying a Hawaiian island where he will build and run a casino. The sceptical David has no faith in Jasons scam, while Jason chides David for wallowing in his dark, lonely depressed life. Sally, increasingly neurotic over losing her looks, cuts off her hair and throws away her cosmetics. When Jason starts packing to leave for Hawaii, in rage and despair she shoots him dead. David escorts his brothers corpse home to Philadelphia by train.
