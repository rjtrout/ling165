Hit man Joe MacBeth goes directly from the assassination of crime boss Dukes second-in-command Tommy to his own wedding, where bride Lily scolds him for being two hours late. Duke rewards him with a mansion by a lake. A fortune teller persuades Lily, however, that Joes destiny is to be the leader, not a follower. Lily is ruthlessly ambitious. After he personally eliminates Dukes gluttonous rival, Big Dutch, at a restaurant, Lily continues to goad Joe into going after his own boss. After eliminating his crime ally Banky and alienating Bankys son Lennie, an evening at the lakeside mansion ends with Duke inviting the lovely Lily to go for a swim. Once in the water, though, Duke is stabbed in the back by Joe and left to die. Lily dives in to make sure. Although he expresses outrage that someone has murdered their boss, Joe is not believed by Lennie, who suspects the truth. Joe begins to be haunted by nightmares and visions. One night, when he believes Lennies men have come to kill him, Joe takes a machine gun and opens fire at a moving curtain. Lily falls dead. Joes own violent end is about to follow.
