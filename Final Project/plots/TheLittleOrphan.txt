Nibbles arrives at Jerrys mousehole, and as he tries to snatch cheese from a trap, Jerry discovers he has been asked to have Nibbles as a guest for Thanksgiving, with a note attached saying "hes always hungry." Jerrys cupboards are empty, so he leads Nibbles to a bowl of cream where Tom is sleeping. After Nibbles sips the cream, Mammy Two Shoes places a turkey on the table. Nibbles proceeds to eat certain foods from the table, while Jerry dresses him and Nibbles as pilgrims, but after Nibbles swallows an orange and inflates, Jerry hits Nibbles with a knife and the orange flies into Toms mouth, waking him up. Tom, now wearing a feather duster as a headdress, catches Nibbles, but Jerry pops a champagne cork into Toms face. Tom then grabs Jerry, but Nibbles launches off jelly and stabs Tom with a fork. Tom then hurls the fork to catch Nibbles, but Jerry, porched on candlestick, whacks Tom in the face with a spoon. Tom then sets pussy willows on fire and melts Jerry and Nibbles hiding places, but Jerry lifts a lid and the willow ricochets back into Toms mouth. Tom then knocks Jerry out with a knife, but Nibbles launches a pie into Toms face, knocking the cat off the table. Nibbles then launches a candle into Toms tail, burning him, before launching a champagne bottle into Tom, after which Tom crashes into a cabinet and surrenders. Tom, Jerry and Nibbles then say grace at the table and prepare to eat a turkey, but Nibbles devours the entire turkey before Tom and Jerry can pick up their cutlery. Nibbles, now with a full stomach, pats his stomach in delight.
