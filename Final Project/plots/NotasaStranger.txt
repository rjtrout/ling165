Lucas Marsh (Robert Mitchum) is a brilliant and dedicated medical student who has aspired to be a doctor since childhood. His mother is dead and he is estranged from his alcoholic father, who has squandered the familys money, leaving Lucas unable to pay for medical school. In order to get the needed tuition money, Lucas marries an older nurse, Kristina "Kris" Hedvigson (Olivia de Havilland), who has substantial savings. Although Kris loves Lucas and helps him in a variety of ways, he is indifferent towards her and considers her "stupid" though she is an excellent nurse. Lucas cares only about doing excellent medical work, and frequently clashes with other doctors he considers incompetent, including his wealthy best friend Alfred Boone (Frank Sinatra). Kris, Alfred, and Lucas mentor Dr. Aarons (Broderick Crawford) try to humanize him and teach him that all doctors sometimes make mistakes. Lucas looks down on doctors who focus on making money, and after completing his internship, he accepts a position working with Dr. Dave Runkleman (Charles Bickford) in his busy practice in rural Greenville, where many patients lack the money to pay. Runkleman has a life-threatening heart condition, so he hired Lucas to help with the workload and perhaps take over the practice. Overworked and frustrated with the incompetent head of the local hospital, Lucas has an affair with rich widow Harriet Lang (Gloria Grahame), causing Kris, who is secretly pregnant, to finally leave him. When Runklemans heart condition flares up, Lucas performs heart surgery to save his life, but makes a mistake during the surgery and Runkleman dies. Struggling to cope with his failure, Lucas begs Kris to help him, and the two reconcile.
