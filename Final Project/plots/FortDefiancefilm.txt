A stranger, Ben Shelby, rides up to a ranch outside Fort Defiance, Arizona, looking for Johnny Tallon. He meets Johnnys blind brother, Ned, and saves him from being trampled by a horse. Ned and his Uncle Charlie run the ranch in Johnnys absence. Ben becomes better acquainted with them but declines their offer to stay, being married. In town, others including ruthless Dave Parker discover that Ben was at the Battle of Tennessee Ridge, where a treasonous act by Johnny caused the death of many soldiers, including Bens brother. Johnny, a gunslinger and robber, arrives and wants Ned to accompany him to San Francisco for an eye operation. Ned refuses to accept his brothers ill-found gains. While fighting off an Indian attack, Ned falls for passenger Julie, a dancehall girl. Johnny is shot dead in Fort Defiance, and after Parker is killed by Ben, the others are free to begin a new life. Bens wife arrives by stagecoach to join them.
