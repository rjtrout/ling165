Johnny and Carol decide to rob a local bootleggers safe during a town picnic. Their accomplice is Roger, a former Army buddy of Johnnys with knowledge of explosives.

At a diner, a sheriff, Carols brother Charlie, spots the fugitives. In deference to his sister, Charlie agrees to give them a 10-minute head start before he contacts his fellow lawmen. But when emerging from a restroom, Roger doesnt realize who Charlie is and shoots him dead. The police eventually surround the gang at a sawmill. During a shootout, Roger is killed. Johnny and Carol drive off in hail of bullets, and Carol is also killed. Johnny drives her body back to her mother and son.
