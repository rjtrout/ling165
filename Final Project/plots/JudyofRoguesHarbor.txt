As described in a film magazine, Judy (Minter), a young woman of the country, lives with her stern grandfather (Roberts), her sister Olive (Ridgeway), and their cousin Denny (Lee), whom the old man, angry that his granddaughter Claudia eloped, mistreats. Their neighbor Jim Shuckles (Sears) aids the old man in his cruelty, hoping to win his aid in his conquest of Judy. Olive, who has been betrayed by Jim, warns her against him. Later Judy is told that Jim plans on throwing a bomb at Governor Kingsland (Standing) of the State. She is instrumental in saving his life and later prevents his confinement to a sanitarium on a trumped up charge of insanity. When a chain of historical events is uncovered that prove that Judy is the daughter of a former now-deceased friend of the Governor and is an heiress. After the marriage of Jim and Olive, and an adjustment of the affairs all around, there is a happy ending.
