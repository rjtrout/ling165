Married couple Josh and Renai Lambert, their children Dalton, Foster, and infant daughter Cali have recently moved into a new home. One night, Dalton is drawn to the attic when he hears creaking noises and sees the door open by itself. He falls from a ladder while investigating and sees a figure in the shadows. Hearing his terrified screams, Renai and Josh rush to his aid. The next day, Dalton falls into an inexplicable coma. After three months of treatment without result, Renai and Josh are allowed to take Dalton home. Soon after, paranormal activity begins to occur; Renai begins hearing voices over the baby monitor when no one is in Calis room. Foster says that Dalton sleepwalks at night, Renai sees a frightening figure of a man in Calis room, who vanishes when Josh comes and the burglar alarm is repeatedly triggered for no reason. After Renai finds a bloody hand print on Daltons bed, she questions Josh about the house, but he ignores her. That night, Renai is attacked by the figure from Calis room, and the Lamberts decide to abandon the house and move elsewhere. In the new house, Renai sees the ghost of a dancing boy who leads her to Daltons room. Joshs mother, Lorraine, visits them one day, and says she had a dream in which a figure in Daltons room replies "Dalton" when she asks what it wants. At the same time, she sees a monstrous red-faced demon standing behind Josh and screams, while Daltons room is ransacked and Dalton himself is found lying on the floor. Lorraine calls demonologists Elise Reiner, Specs, and Tucker. Upon entering, Elise senses a presence in the house and upon entering Daltons room and she sees something on the ceiling. Specs draws the demonic, red-faced figure Lorraine saw. Elise explains that Dalton is not in a coma; he was born with the ability to travel mentally to the astral plane, and had been doing so in his sleep, believing his abilities to merely be dreams. He had traveled too far and became lost in a purgatory realm called "The Further", a place inhabited by the tortured souls of the dead. Without his mental presence, Daltons body appears comatose and spirits can use it to enter the physical world. Josh is skeptical until he realizes that drawings in Daltons bedroom hinted at his astral projection abilities and the same red-faced demon Lorraine had seen. Elise performs a seance to communicate with Dalton, but they contact the demon who uses Daltons body to attack them until it is stopped by Elise. Elise reveals that her acquaintance with Lorraine is decades old, because she previously performed the same service on Josh when he was eight years old. Josh was terrorized by the parasitic spirit of an old woman. Lorraine dismissed his nightmares until the spirit showed up in her photos of Josh, progressively getting closer each time. Josh also possesses the ability to astral project, though he had suppressed his memory of the ability years prior with Elises help. Dalton has inherited this trait from him. Elise tells Josh that the only way to rescue Dalton is for him to go into the Further. Elise puts Josh in a trance and he is able to project himself to their previous house. He goes to the attic, but is attacked by the same figure that attacked Renai. After defeating him, Josh enters the Demons lair, where Josh finds Dalton chained to the floor. Josh frees him, but they are caught by the demon while the spirits of the Further invade the real world and terrorize Elise, Renai, and the others. After managing to escape, Josh confronts the old woman that haunted him as a child. The old woman dissolves into darkness after Josh shouts at it to leave him alone. When Josh and Dalton return to their bodies, they wake up in their new home and the spirits seem to disappear. As they celebrate the apparent end of their ordeal, Elise starts packing her equipment with Josh, when she senses that something is wrong, noticing Joshs hands look old and dirty, she takes a photo of him. Josh, enraged by this, strangles Elise to death. Renai is horrified when she discovers Elises dead body and searches for Josh. Renai picks up the camera and sees that the image Elise took of Josh is the old woman that haunted him as a child, implying that Josh has been possessed. Josh suddenly puts his hand on her shoulder, says "Renai, Im here", and she turns around and gasps.
