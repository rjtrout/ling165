The attack on Pearl Harbor occurs and Americas declaration of war stirs patriotism in Connie Mathers, who until now has been more interested in Washington, D.C. parties and clothes. A comment by shipping magnates son Tommy Aldrich that people like Connie and him are "useless" to the war effort inspires Connie to prove him wrong. Offering her services as a spy to sister Agathas boyfriend Elliott, an army intelligence agent, Connie ends up being approached by a mysterious man who identifies himself as "Mr. Fortune" and assigns tasks to test her, using passages from the book Gone With the Wind as a code. When she meets Mr. Fortunes approval, he has her investigate whether Tommy is an enemy spy. A confused Connie confides in Elliott, but soon he disappears. After her sister also vanishes, Connie realizes shes been duped by Mr. Fortune, who proceeds to take her and Tommy captive as well. Luckily, she escapes in time to help the military head off an enemy submarine, saving the day.
