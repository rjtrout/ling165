Speed has revealed that he is having marital problems with his wife Connie (Drew). Kismet convinces him to pretend to be a ghost to persuade Connie to get rid of a romantic rival, Gordon Tolliver (Rudy Vall√©e), Connies old admirer. Comic hijinks ensue, but in the end, Connie realizes she still loves Speed.
