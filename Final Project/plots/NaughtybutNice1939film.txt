Professor Donald Hardwick (Dick Powell), who lectures his students against swing music and jitterbugging, goes to New York City to get his symphony published, but accidentally writes a hit swing song ("Hooray for Spinach, Hooray for Milk") with the connivance of aspiring lyricist Linda McKay (Gale Page), which brings him into disrepute with the Dean of his college (Halliwell Hobbes). After the teetotaling professor accidentally gets drunk, Hardwick promises to stay in New York City for the summer and write songs with McKay, and they have three more hits. Unfortunately, singer Zelda Manion (Ann Sheridan) exploits his talents to her own advantage by getting Hardwick drunk again, and tricking him into signing a contract with her publisher. His new lyricist, Joe Dirk (Allen Jenkins), gets Hardwick in trouble by copying a classical piece of music and signing Hardwicks name to it. At Hardwicks trial, his aunts (Helen Broderick, ZaSu Pitts, Vera Lewis and Elizabeth Dunne) convince the judge (Granville Bates), a songwriter himself, that the earlier melody was copied from an even earlier piece now in the public domain, and the judge throws the case out.
