Tom is relaxing in a penthouse, while Jerry is struggling looking for food, being forced to tie his tail around his waist to stop his stomach growling. Suddenly Jerry sees a lunchbox at a 50-story building construction site and jumps into it, eating through to it. However, the steel beam on which the lunchbox is sitting is lifted into the air and the box slides off. Jerry tries to hide in the lunchbox, but it bursts open. The lunchbox then falls onto Toms head, much to Toms annoyance, but Tom sees Jerry falling and catches him in a baseball glove inbetween two pieces of bread. Tom eats the sandwich, but notices he missed eating Jerry. Tom eats the rest of the sandwich, but Jerry escapes by flicking Toms finger into his eye. Jerry jumps into a rain gutter, but unawarely slides backwards onto the construction site, barely managing to evade a crusher. Jerry jumps into Toms mouth and closes his ears and eyes, but Tom shakes Jerry out. Tom grabs a flyswatter and flattens Jerry four times, but Jerry angrily stops him. He marches towards Tom and holds out his hand as if to say, "Hand over the flyswatter." And then he flattens Toms head to escape. Jerry runs to the end of a flagpole, with Tom following, but Jerry spins the pole counterclockwise. Tom, running very fast, convinces Jerry to stop, but Jerry lets Tom know that he loves him before unscrewing the ball to sending Toms falls down to the construction site and into a giant building hosting a big dog show before the dogs attack Tom to his doom. Finally, Jerry relaxes in Toms penthouse and drinks some juice but ends up swallowing a whole ice cube before he decides to take a nap.
