Sgt. Rusty Curtis of the U.S. Cavalry division is unhappy about the Armys plan to replace horses with tanks. After a medical discharge, Rusty tries to buy his old military mount, Sireson, but wealthy socialite Sally Crandall outbids him. Sally is the fiancee of Rustys old barracks mate, Jack Martin. Sallys father hires Rusty to train the horse for a big steeplechase race. A rivalry begins because Sally has a favorite horse of her own, but when hers is hurt, she and Rusty declare a truce and begin a romantic relationship. Jack returns and overhears a conversation leading him to believe Rusty intends to lose the race on purpose. The two men fight after Jack insists on riding the horse in the race, but Jacks fears are overcome when Rusty superbly rides Sireson to victory.
