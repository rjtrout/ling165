Tom is first seen being ship-wrecked and lost at sea in a parody of Robinson Crusoe. He only has his old shoes to eat in order to survive. Tom though soon spots a distant tropical island and is catapulted there by a wave. After Tom finds it tough to eat a coconut and a tortoise he finds Jerry and decides to eat the mouse instead. Tom has Jerry on a frying pan but the rodent escapes and Tom chases him into a native village. Jerry creeps Tom out by playing tom toms and Tom gets scared. Using soot from a cooking pot Jerry disguises himself as a black native complete with a deep voice and talks gibberish to Tom. He presumably tells Tom he has to be cooked to death and orders him to "hop the pot". Then he gives him vegetables to cut but to "hold the onions". Tom, accepting his fate, cooperates. He soon feels the heat after Jerry lights a fire. Tom though notices Jerrys loincloth has come loose exposing his brown fur. Discovering he has been played for a sap the cat taunts Jerry. Jerry using a bone tied to his head flies away and Tom gives chase. However, the cat ends up stopping at the feet of a group of real cannibals. When Tom looks up, he is frightened to see them with the leader of them licking his lips delightfully and fancying barbecued cat. In horror, Tom runs away. The cannibals chase after him. Jerry seems to have been safe now but he then spots a shorter and thicker-lipped cannibal who also licks his lips in delight, fancying barbecued mouse. Soon, Jerry is so terrified that he also runs off, then the cannibal chases after the mouse before the cartoon irises out.
