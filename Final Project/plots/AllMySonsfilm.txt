Joe Keller is sorry to hear son Chris plans to wed Ann Deever and move to Chicago, for he hoped Chris would someday take over the manufacturing business Joe built from the ground up. Joes business partner used to be Anns father Herb, but when both men were charged with shipping defective airplane parts that resulted in wartime crashes and deaths, only Herb was convicted and sent to prison. Another son of the Kellers is in the Army air corps, missing in action and presumed dead. Ann used to be engaged to him and her engagement to his brother upsets Kate Keller, who hasnt yet accepted that son Larry is gone for good. Anns attorney brother George strongly discourages her from marrying a Keller, and many in town still whisper that Joe was responsible for the death of twenty one pilots. A war widow even calls Joe a murderer to his face in a restaurant. On a visit to Anns father in prison, Chris hears how Joe called in sick on the one day the Army came to pick up the airplane parts. Joe admits to Chris that he knew they were defective, but repairs would have been costly and could have bankrupted the business. Chris strikes his father in anger at hearing this. A letter from Larry reveals that he knew of his fathers guilt and intended to go on a suicide mission in a plane, no longer wanting to live with the familys shame. This is the final disgrace for Joe, who shoots himself.
