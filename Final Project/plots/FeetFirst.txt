Harold Horne, an ambitious shoe salesman in Honolulu, unknowingly meets the boss secretary Barbara (Barbara Kent) - thinking she is the boss daughter - and tells her he is a millionaire leather tycoon. Horne spends much of his time around Barbara hiding his true circumstances, in both the shoe store and later as an (accidental) stowaway on board a ship. Trying to evade the ships crew, he becomes trapped in a mailbag, which is taken off the ship and falls off a delivery cart onto a window cleaners cradle, which is hoisted upwards. Escaping from the bag, he finds himself dangling high above the streets of Los Angeles. After several thwarted attempts to get inside the building, he climbs to the very top, only to slip off - unaware his foot is caught on the end of a rope, which rescues him inches from the ground.
