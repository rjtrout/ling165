An investigation of a dead daughter begins when a military contractor Lex Walker (Craig Fairbrass) arrives in Los Angeles and he finds the body is not his daughters. Lex Walker, a British mercenary battling in Afghanistan who drops everything to hurry to Los Angeles when he is informed that his daughter Samantha, who he has not seen in many years, has been found dead. When he arrives at the morgue to identify the body, he is for some reason unsurprised to discover that it is not hers. So he begins a one-man investigation into her whereabouts, trailed by the suspicious detective (Jason Patric) assigned to the case. He soon makes his way to Samanthas boss, Karl Schuster (James Caan), the millionaire CEO of a high-tech company who offers sympathy but little help. It quickly becomes obvious that Schuster is hiding something, since he displays no hesitation about shooting one of his henchmen to death in his own office. Aided by a sexy barmaid (Shannon Elizabeth) enticed by his offer of a $10,000 finders fee, the take-no-prisoners Lex sets out getting to the bottom of the mystery, beating up or shooting the myriad human obstacles who get in his way. It all leads to his discovery of a massive identity-theft scheme engineered by Schuster about which Lexs very much alive daughter (Melissa Ordway) has the goods.
