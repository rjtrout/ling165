While collecting acorns, Chip n Dale discover a peanut that had been thrown from the nearby zoo. At the zoo, guests feed, and Donald Duck takes care of Dolores the Elephant. Chip n Dale try to steal peanuts from the elephant, but their theft is discovered. Trying to escape from Donald, Dale trips in a bucket of white paint, covering himself in it. This gives Chip an idea. Smiling, he says, "Ive got an idea! Listen to this!" before grabbing Dales ear and beginning to whisper in it. He whispers his plan in Dales ear. While he is whispering, Dale listens closely and begins to smile, liking Chips plan. He continues to smile as Chip continues to whisper. When he has finished whispering, he grabs the paintbrush and begins to cover Dale in paint. Together, the two cover themselves in the white paint and successfully convince Donald that they belong in an albino chipmunk exhibit at the zoo, where they are fed peanuts.
