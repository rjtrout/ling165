17-year-old Daphne Simms (Kaye) learns of her biological father from letters left by her deceased mother. She runs away from her New York home and adopted parents in search of her father in Los Angeles. Unaware of the dangers on the road, she attempts to hitchhike but learns a valuable lesson early. A seemingly nice, middle-aged man offers her a ride then takes her into a deserted area where he tries to take advantage of her. She manages to escape, but she is left in the darkness in the middle of nowhere. She succeeds in finding the main road and eventually reaches a gas station. It is here she meets Fargo (Parks). Initially wary of his attention, they eventually start a conversation. Though it appears that Fargoâ€™s intentions are to hustle her for money, she agrees to allow him to help her get to California. Through run-ins with hobos and the police, arguments with and misunderstandings about each other, and a serious illness while on their journey, a close friendship forms, and they begin to have feelings for each other. Upon arriving in L.A., Daphne finds her father, but she is disappointed. At the couples hotel, Daphnes adopted parents arrive and ask her to accompany them home. They express forgiveness and a willingness to accept Fargo, suggesting they will help him settle in New York. Fargo rejects the offer and tells Daphne go with her parents. Later that night as he leaves a bar, he finds Daphne waiting for him outside. She has decided to stay with him. Arms around each other, they walk along the dark street.
