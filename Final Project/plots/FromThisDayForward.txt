Army sergeant Bill Cummings (Mark Stevens) is about to be discharged after service in World War II. He was a blue collar worker in civilian life and is seeking employment. As he fills out forms and speaks to personnel at the United States Employment Service, he thinks back on the life events that brought him to this point. Flashbacks show him at various times in his prewar life. He is shown meeting and marrying his wife Susan (Joan Fontaine) in 1938. Other flashbacks describe their hardscrabble life in a poor neighborhood of New York City during the Great Depression. He and various relatives are shown as frequently unemployed and having difficulty making a living. He and Susans financial ups and downs are depicted, as are the humiliation of being supported by Susans bookstore clerking job, and unfairly being prosecuted as a pornographer. At the conclusion of the film, he is shown being referred to a badly needed job interview, and that Susan is pregnant.
