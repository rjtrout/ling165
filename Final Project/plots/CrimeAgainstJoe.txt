A Korean War veteran is accused of the murder of a night club singer in Tucson Arizona. A high school pin was found on the scene of the crime and the veterans pin is missing. However, when the crime was committed, the veteran was leading a female somnambulist to her home but her over-protective father gives a false testimony to the district attorney. "Slacks", a female friend, gives him a false alibi but the police soon sort that out. The veteran thinks that one of his fellow high school students from 1945 was the murderer. He has got possible suspects on a list. Is the murderer among them?
