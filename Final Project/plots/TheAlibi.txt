A man (Steve Coogan) who runs an alibi agency, a service for adulterous husbands and wives that provides airtight alibis, runs into trouble with his latest client. In order to remedy the problem, he has to rely on a very enticing woman (Rebecca Romijn), his assistant/partner. The plot thickens when he switches identities with one of his clients (James Marsden) for a weekend, and the clients girlfriend dies in an accident. With the police, an assassin, and a jealous ex-boyfriend to run from, he discovers that he will need all the ingenuity he can muster to survive.
