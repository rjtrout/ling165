Undergoing a messy divorce, Sarah Lawson visits her brother Robert Harmon, an alcoholic playboy and writer who is in a relationship with a professional singer. Robert is visited by his ex-wife and forced to take care of their eight-year-old son, whom he has never met before, for twenty-four hours. Roberts son is terrified by the hedonistic and decadent world of his father, and begs to be taken home following an overnight trip to Las Vegas. After dropping him off, Robert is beaten up by the boys stepfather, after which his son testifies his love for Robert. Fleeing the scene, Robert returns home to take care of his sister, his "best friend". Sarah tries with some success to curb the nihilistic self-destruction of Roberts life and simultaneously deal with her own depression and divorce, while Robert struggles between his intense desire to protect his sister, and the challenge of accepting her freedom as the necessary cost of love.
