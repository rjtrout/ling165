Insurance investigators Eve Rogers and Mike Reagan are assigned to a Louisiana case involving a stolen emerald necklace, following a private detectives death. Disagreeing over how to work the case, Eve and Mike decide to do so separately, not revealing their true identities to their suspects, the Baylor family. Rosalind Baylor confides that she and her mother despise brother Eric and relate how another brother, David, committed suicide. Eric takes a romantic interest in Eve, which becomes mutual, even though he is under suspicion. Mike, meantime, teams with Marie Revelle, a woman he meets, unaware that she is secretly Erics lover. David turns out to be still alive. But when he presses his brother Eric for his cut of the insurance loot, Eric kills him. Eric also murders Marie and has the same thing in mind for Eve after discovering who she really is, but a violent fistfight with Mike results in Erics death and recovery of the necklace. Mike and Eve, relieved to be alive, realize they are in love with one another.
