Kate Bosworth (Bette Davis) is a sincere, demure, artist who misses her boat to an island off New England, where she intends to meet her twin sister Patricia (also Davis) and her cousin Freddie (Charles Ruggles). She persuades Bill Emerson (Glenn Ford) to take her home in his boat. Later, their relationship grows while she paints a portrait of Eben Folger (Walter Brennan), the old lighthouse keeper, and Kate is very much in love. However, her sister Pat, a flamboyant, man-hungry manipulator, fools Bill when she first meets him pretending to be Kate. Pat then pursues him on a trip out of town, and when they return, they announce to Kate their intention to marry. A heartbroken Kate focuses on her work with artist Karnock (Dane Clark), but rejects his romantic overtures. Bill eventually goes to Chile, allowing Kate to spend some time with her sister, whom she hasnt seen since the marriage. When the two go sailing, a sudden storm washes Pat overboard and she drowns, her wedding ring coming off in Kates hands while trying to save her. Kate passes out and is washed ashore in the boat. When she regains consciousness, she is mistaken for Pat. Bill is about to return, so Kate decides to assume her late sisters identity. To her surprise, she learns that Bill is angry at Pat for her many affairs and in no mood to continue the marriage. Cousin Freddie has guessed the truth and insists that Kate must reveal to Bill her real identity. When she does, Bill realizes that Kate is the one he truly loves.
