Jack Lemmon stars as the playboy landlord Hogan, a swinging bachelor. Women are mere playthings to him, plus hes a master con man. His bachelor pad is a holy temple of seduction: blood-red walls, African sculptures, a well-stocked cocktail bar, a switch-operated fireplace, and mechanized violins that play romantic music at the touch of a button. He walks around wearing a scarlet cardigan (with matching socks and shirts) and a devilish smirk. As the independently wealthy landlord of a beautifully designed California apartment block that includes tropical plants, he only rents rooms to gorgeous single women at just $75 a month. The film begins as Irene (Adams), a recently divorced tenant, has just concluded a relationship with Hogan. Shes moving out of the apartment with the assistance of her friend Charles (Lansing). It is immediately snapped up by her naive niece, Robin (Lynley). Hogan is thrilled at the prospect of yet another beautiful tenant to seduce, but is initially unaware that Robins short-tempered, frustrated, bumbling boyfriend David (Jones) is moving in with herâ€”but in a platonic capacity only, to determine their compatibility. Temptation is naturally there, but Hogan does his best to prevent David and Robin from consummating their relationship. Irene, who has only lately come to realize the extent of Hogans promiscuity, is determined to prevent him from getting his hands on her niece. Irene confronts him at his barber, and Hogan is self-defensive and self-deluded to comic effect. An older married couple, handyman Murphy (Lynde) and maid Dorcas (Coca) work for Hogan, he the stereotypical harried husband, she the stereotypical loud and overbearing wife. Irenes counsel/advice (about what love is) to the young couple at the end of the film is particularly moving, when considering Edie Adams had lost her real-life husband, Ernie Kovacs, the previous year.
