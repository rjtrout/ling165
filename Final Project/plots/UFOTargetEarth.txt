The film opens with "eyewitness accounts recounting incredible UFO sightings and abductions", according to sci-fi scholar Howard Hughes. The story follows an electronics expert (Alan Grimes) who picks up strange signals: he then finds the signals are coming from a rural section in his area, and tries to find out if this is the start of an invasion from space. He enlists the help of a psychic "sensitive" (Vivian), and two fellow university computer electronics experts (Dr. Mansfield and Dan Rivers), and together they trace the source to a location somewhere beneath the surface of a lake. The alien presence discloses itself to Alan as formless energy trapped there 1000 years by the fears of humans, which impose shapes on them. Alan is the source of the energy they need to return. All he has to do is set aside his fears and die. They tell him that in the whole history of the human race only three had ascended and now he will be the fourth to ascend. Alan rapidly ages, walks into the lake, fights off Dans attempts to restrain him, and dies. Dan frantically pulls Alans skeletal remains back onto the shore, the energy pattern departs into space, and the screen displays a quote from Revelations 5.9.
