Cal Wayne accidentally kills a fellow Confederate soldier during the Civil War. He returns to his hometown of Abilene, Kansas after the war and ends up replacing the corrupt Joe Slade as the towns sheriff. A feud is ongoing between local cattlemen and farmers. Cattle baron Grant Evers takes it upon himself to exact harsh justice against rustlers, with or without proof. A grudge exists between Evers and the new sheriff because Cals fiancee, Amy Martin, believing he was dead, is now engaged to marry Evers. Evers learns that it was his own brother who was shot by Cal during the war. But he is killed by Slade in a quarrel, whereupon Slade is shot dead by Cal.
