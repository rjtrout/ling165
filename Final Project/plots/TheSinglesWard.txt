After faithfully serving a full-time mission for the LDS Church and marrying, Jonathan Jordan finds himself divorced and once again a member of the LDS single adult world. He attends a "singles ward", a congregation specifically for unmarried adults where the ultimate goal is Eternal Marriage. Disenchanted, Jordan stops going to church. He even creates a standup routine lampooning the Mormon lifestyle. His resistance to the church continues until he falls for Cammie Giles, a member of the local singles ward. Suddenly, Jordan finds going to church more appealing. But is he attending church again just to impress her? During the course of the movie, Jonathan frequently breaks the fourth wall to narrate events to the audience.
