Charlie is a young Italian-American man in New York City. He is hampered by his feeling of responsibility towards his reckless younger friend Johnny Boy, a small-time gambler who owes money to many loan sharks. Charlie works for his uncle Giovanni, a powerful loan shark and political fixer, mostly collecting debts. He is also having a secret affair with Johnny Boys cousin Teresa, who has epilepsy and is ostracized because of her conditionâ€”especially by Charlies uncle. Charlies uncle also wants Charlie not to be such close friends with Johnny, saying "Honorable men go with honorable men." Charlie is torn between his devout Catholicism and his illicit work for his uncle. Johnny becomes increasingly self-destructive and disrespectful of his creditors. Failing to receive redemption in the church, Charlie seeks it through sacrificing himself on Johnnys behalf. At a bar, Michael, a small time loan shark, comes looking for Johnny to "pay up". To his surprise, Johnny insults him. Michael lunges at Johnny, who pulls a gun. After a tense standoff, Michael walks away, and Charlie convinces Johnny that they should leave town for a brief period. Teresa insists on coming with them. Charlie borrows a car and they drive off, leaving the neighborhood without incident. A car that has been following them suddenly pulls up, Michael at the wheel and his henchman, Jimmy Shorts, in the backseat. Jimmy fires several shots at Charlies car, hitting Johnny in the neck and Charlie in the hand, causing Charlie to crash the car. An ambulance and police arrive at the scene, and paramedics take Charlie and Johnny away.
