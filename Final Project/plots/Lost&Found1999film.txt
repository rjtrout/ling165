Restaurant owner Dylan Ramsey (David Spade) is head-over-heels in love with his new neighbor, a French cellist named Lila (Sophie Marceau). In a desperate attempt to garner her affections, he kidnaps her beloved pet dog and offers to help her find him on a phantom dog hunt. A wrench is thrown in his plans, however, when the dog swallows his best friends diamond ring, and things get worse for Dylan as Lilas ex-fiancee, Rene, arrives to win her back. At the end, Dylan and Lila got together while Rene is arrested after a boy lied and told the police that he touched him.
