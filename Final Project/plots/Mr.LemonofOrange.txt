El Brendel plays the dual role of Silent McGee, a tough gangster, and Mr. Oscar Lemon, a mild-mannered Swede who coincidentally looks exactly like the gangster McGee. Silent McGee disguises himself as a Swedish immigrant while running from the law, causing Mr. Lemon to be mistaken for the wanted man. Fifi DOrsay stars as Julie LaRue, a comedic vamp who pursues the comparatively innocent Mr. Lemon.
