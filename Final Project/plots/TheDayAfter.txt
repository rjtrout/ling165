The story follows several citizens—and people they encounter—in and around Kansas City, Missouri and the college town of Lawrence, Kansas, 40 miles (64 km) to its west. The films narrative is structured as a before-during-after scenario of a nuclear attack: the first segment introduces the various characters and their stories; the second shows the nuclear disaster itself; and the third details the effects of the fallout on the characters. During the first segment, as the characters are introduced, the chronology of events leading up to the war is depicted entirely via television and radio news broadcasts as well as communications among US military personnel and hearsay, enhanced by characters reactions and analysis of the events.
