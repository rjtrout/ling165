The film is based on the 1894 novel by Stanley J. Weyman and is set during the religious wars of early 17th century France; events in the novel itself means it can be dated to the autumn of 1630. Notorious gambler and dreaded swordsman Gil de Berault returns to Paris after carrying out a mission for the Red Robe or Cardinal Richelieu and finds him concerned by growing opposition from French Protestants or Huguenots in the south. He also warns de Berault dueling has been outlawed and henceforth punishable by death but Gil promptly disobeys the law and is sentenced to be executed as a result. The Cardinal offers de Berault a pardon if he is able to capture the Protestant Duc de Foix who is organizing plans for an uprising. Gil agrees, travels to the dukes home and is allowed to stay as a guest, but the dukes wife and his sister Lady Marguerite immediately suspect he is a spy. Nevertheless, he makes good progress but then falls in love with Marguerite, forcing him to choose between conscience and self-interest.
