Chaplins character attempts to convince a passerby (director Henry Lehrman) to give him money. Chaplin is then shown flirting with a woman and proposes to her, which she accepts. Lehrman enters to present the woman with flowers and a ring, which the woman refuses citing shes engaged. Lerhman sees Chaplin and a slapstick fight between the two ensues. Later, Lehrmans character takes a photograph of an automobile accident; Chaplins character steals the camera whilst the journalist is helping a trapped motorist and rushes back to the paper with it to claim the photograph as his own. A short pursuit with the Keystone Kops follows.
