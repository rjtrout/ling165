Chili Palmer helps the widow of an executed friend to resurrect a record company using the talents of young and talented female vocalist and songwriter. The plot is complicated by several facts: In a loan-shark subplot from Get Shorty of "who owns who", Chili makes deals and owns all the players as a "producer". The Russian Mafia (headed by Alex Kubik as Roman Bulkin) are trying to kill Chili because he witnessed the execution of Athens. Athens record company owes money to a gangster/producer, Sin LaSalle.
