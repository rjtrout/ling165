The story sees brother and sister Tom and Ellen Bowen as stars of a show Every Night at Seven, a Broadway success. They are persuaded to take the show to London, capitalizing on the imminent royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip Mountbatten.  On the ship, Ellen meets and quickly falls in love with the impoverished but well-connected Lord John Brindale. Whilst casting the show in London, Tom falls in love with a newly engaged dancer, Anne Ashmond. Tom assists Anne to reconcile her estranged parents and also asks his agent to locate Annes supposed fiancé in Chicago – only to discover that hes married and therefore Anne is free to do what she likes. Carried away by the emotion of the wedding, the two couples decide that they will also be married that day. Thanks to the resourcefulness of Toms London agent, Edgar Klinger, who knows someone in the Archbishops office who can cut through the official red tape and also has a cooperative minister in his pocket Anne and Tom, and Ellen and John, are in fact married on the royal wedding day.
