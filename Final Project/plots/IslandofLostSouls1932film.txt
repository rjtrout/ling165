Shipwrecked traveler Edward Parker (Richard Arlen) is rescued by a freighter delivering animals to an isolated South Seas island owned by Dr. Moreau (Charles Laughton). When Parker objects to the freighters captain (Stanley Fields) mistreating Mling (Tetsu Komai), an odd-looking passenger with strangely bestial festures, the captain tosses Parker overboard into Mr. Montgomery (Arthur Hohl) and Moreaus boat. When Parker arrives at his island, Moreau offers Parker the hospitality of his home and introduces him to Lota (Kathleen Burke), a beautiful, gentle girl who seems a bit simple. When the two hear screams coming from a locked room, which Lota calls "the House of Pain," Parker investigates. He sees Moreau and Montgomery operating on a person without anesthetic. Convinced that Moreau is engaged in sadistic vivisection, Parker tries to leave, only to encounter brutish-looking men resembling apes, felines, swine, and other beasts emerging from the jungle. Moreau appears, cracks his whip, and orders the one known as the Sayer of the Law (Béla Lugosi), a wolflike creature, to repeat the rule against violence. Afterward, the strange men disperse. Back in the main house, the doctor corrects Parkers mistaken impression. Moreau explains that he started experimenting in London many years previously, accelerating the evolution of plants. He eventually graduated to animals, trying to transform them into people through "plastic surgery, blood transfusions, gland extracts, and ray baths". He would still be working in England on his "bio-anthropological research" if a dog had not escaped from his laboratory and so horrified the people that he was forced to leave. He reveals that Lota is the sole woman on the island, but hides the fact that she is derived from a panther. Later in private, he expresses his excitement to his assistant, Montgomery, that Lota is becoming more human in her emotions due to her attraction to Parker. To keep Parker around to continue the process, Moreau sees to it that the boat that was to take Parker away is destroyed and places the blame on his beast-men. As Parker spends time with Lota, she falls in love with him. Eventually the two kiss, but Parker is stricken with guilt, as he has a fiancee, Ruth Thomas (Leila Hyams). When Lota hugs him, Parker feels pain from her fingernails, which have reverted to animal-like claws. In a fit of rage, he storms into the office of Dr. Moreau and tells him that he considers it criminal to turn panthers into women. Dr. Moreau calmly explains that Lota is his most perfect creation, and he wanted to see if she was capable of falling in love with a man and bearing human-like children. Parker punches Moreau and orders him to make arrangements for him to leave the island as soon as possible. When Moreau discovers that Parker found out about Lotas nature because she is starting to revert to her panther origin, then he despairs, believing that he has failed – until he notices Lota weeping as humans do. His hopes are raised and he screams that he will burn out all the animal in her in the House of Pain. In the meantime, the American consul (George Irving) at Apia in Samoa, Parkers destination, learns where Parker is from the cowed freighter captain. Ruth persuades Captain Donahue (Paul Hurst) to take her to Moreaus island. She is reunited with Parker, but, as it is late, Moreau persuades them that it is too dangerous to return immediately to Donahues ship. They reluctantly agree to stay the night. The apelike Ouran, one of Moreaus creations, tries to break into Ruths room. (It is implied that this is arranged by Moreau, who is eager to see if his beast-men can successfully mate with humans.) Fortunately, she wakes up and screams for help. Donahue then offers to try to reach the ship and fetch his crew. Moreau, seeing him depart, dispatches Ouran to strangle him. This has an unforeseen effect, however. The beast-men no longer feel bound by Moreaus laws, as he has himself broken one of them. Reverting to their animal nature, they set their huts ablaze and defy Moreau, who tries to regain control with his whip, but to no avail. In desperation, he demands of them, "What is the law?" Their response is, "Law no more!" The beast-men drag the doctor into his House of Pain, where they bind the screaming man to the operating table and destroy him with his own surgical instruments. With help from the fed-up Montgomery, Parker and Ruth make their escape. Parker insists on taking Lota with them. When Lota sees Ouran following, she waits in ambush. In the ensuing struggle, both are killed. The others escape by boat as the island goes up in flames, presumably destroying all of Moreaus work and eradicating the beast-men.
