Accused of throwing races back home, American jockey Danny Arnold now rides horses in Italy, where a gangster named Bork insists he deliberately lose a race. Dan double-crosses him, then avoids Borks thugs, taking young son Joe with him to Paris. Intending to look up an old friend, Dan learns from cafe owner Paule Manet that the friend was murdered by criminals due to unpaid debts. British jockey George Gardner is able to find Dan gainful employment at the racetrack, while Joe persuades his dad that a new horse of theirs called Gilford would make a fine steeplechase racer. Dan disappoints his son by winning money on a fixed race that involved George. Bork and his henchmen turn up. They threaten to kill Dan if he doesnt lose the next steeplechase race. They have their own jockey in the race to make sure things go their way, but Dan defies them, with Georges help. He wins the race, but when another horse runs into Gilford at the finish line, Dan is thrown off and killed.
