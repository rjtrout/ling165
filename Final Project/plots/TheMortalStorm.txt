In 1933, Freya Roth (Margaret Sullavan) is a young German girl engaged to a Nazi party member (Robert Young). When she realizes the true nature of his political views she breaks the engagement and turns her attention to anti-Nazi Martin Breitner (James Stewart). Her father, Professor Roth (Frank Morgan), does not abide by the attitude of the new order towards scientific fact. Though his stepsons Erich (William T. Orr) and Otto (Robert Stack) eagerly embrace the regime, Professor Roths reluctance to conform leads at first to a boycott of his classes and eventually to his arrest. He, a 60-year-old man, is imprisoned and forced to perform strenuous physical labor. His wife is permitted a five-minute visit in which the professor urges her to take Freya and her younger brother and leave the country. He dies soon after. Freya is kept from leaving by Nazi officials suspicious of her fathers work. She reunites with Martin and together they attempt to escape through a mountain pass. A squad (reluctantly led by her former fiancee) gives chase and Freya is fatally wounded, dying in Martins arms just after they cross the border. Later, Erich and Otto are informed of their sisters death. Erich responds with anger towards Martin. Otto, however, experiences an epiphany, and flees their once-happy home, rejecting the Nazis and their cruel doctrine.
