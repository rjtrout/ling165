Twelve-year-old Gretas dad Tom is moving the kids cross-country, promising a California paradise and packing half the household into a dented station wagon. Mom is supposed to join them later. But as they travel through forests, plains and deserts, stopping at fast food joints, shoddy motels, and a poor substitute for the Grand Canyon, Greta gradually realizes that her family is falling apart.
