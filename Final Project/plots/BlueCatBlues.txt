A depressed Tom sits on a railroad bridge, bent on suicide. Watching from overhead, Jerry laments his old friends state and recalls the events leading up to Toms depression. Tom and Jerry had been inseparable until Tom fell in love with a beautiful white female cat. The white cat initially reciprocated Toms affections, but, as Jerry suspected, proved herself to be a gold digger when she leaves Tom for the much wealthier Mr. Butch. Jerry urges Tom to forget about the white cat, but Tom ignores Jerrys advice. He pushes himself and his finances to beyond absurd lengths to buy gifts to try to win back his ex-girlfriend. However, every heartfelt, though paltry, gift that Tom presents to the white cat to impress her is outrageously and excessively outdone by Mr. Butch. Heartbroken, penniless, and hopelessly in debt, Tom drowns his sorrows in milk as Jerrys pleas for him to stop are rebuffed. Tom tries to literally let himself go down the gutter, but Jerry rescues him. As Jerry resuscitates Tom, they see Mr. Butch and the white cat driving by in Mr. Butchs coupe, newly married and embarking on their honeymoon. Jerry breaks from the sad story to think about his own girlfriend, Toots. He is reveling in her love for and faithfulness to him until he sees her riding by with another mouse, just married and going on their honeymoon. Jerry, now dejected, joins Tom on the railroad tracks, as the whistle of an oncoming train grows louder as the cartoon fades out.
