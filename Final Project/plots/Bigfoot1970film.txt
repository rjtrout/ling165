Fast-talking Jasper B. Hawks drives through a forest with his sidekick, Elmer Briggs, while pilot Joi Landis flies a single engine small aircraft over the same area. Joiâ€™s engine conks out, so she parachutes to safety. Safely on the ground, she encounters a Bigfoot that has emerged from the woods to attack her. Laconic biker Rick, rolls into the woods with his girlfriend, Chris, who stumbles onto a Bigfoot burial ground, and then is also under attack by a Bigfoot. A skeptical Sheriffs department and the rangers station are notified of the womens disappearance, but to no avail, with respect to the authorities actually making a search for the missing women. Rick seeks help, but only Jasper B. Hawks believes his story; Jasper offers aid because he plans to capture a Bigfoot for freak show exhibition. Meanwhile, Peggy, is captured and tied up next to Joi. Jasper, Elmer, and Rick trek through the woods until they reach the Bigfoot lair. The creatures, it turns out, who have been guarding the women are just the children of a 200-foot male Bigfoot. He shows up and fights a giant bear. The 200-ft male Bigfoot is gassed by the bikers, and gets put in the freak show. He escapes rather quickly, steps on a local drunk, Lucky Bob, then goes on a rampage through town before returning back to his cave and getting blown up by Ricks dynamite-wielding bikers. Jasper says a line from King Kong and with all the creatures dead, everybody returns to their normal lives.
