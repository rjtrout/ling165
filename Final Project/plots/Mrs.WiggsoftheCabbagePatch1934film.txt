Mrs. Wiggs (Lord), facing eviction, scrabbles for survival with her number of children and hopes for the return of her husband, who left many years before, looking for gold in the Klondike. The family owns the shack but it has a mortgage of $25 (in 1901, about $675 in todays money) and the evil moneylender is threatening them. Mrs. Wiggs is a laundress but cant manage to save enough back because whatever extra money she gets is used to help others, often animals. The oldest son, James, has worked hard all his life, but now is seriously ill with tuberculosis. The little girls are all named "out of geography", Europena (Virginia Weidler), Asia (Carmencita Johnson) and Australia (Edith Fellows). The second-oldest boy, Billy (Jimmy Butler), is something of an entrepreneur. When he finds a spavined and dying horse he brings it home and the family nurses it back to reasonable health, naming it Cuba. Neighbor Tabitha Hazy (ZaSu Pitts) seeks a husband and takes out a subscription to "The Matrimonial Guide", the 1901 version of a dating service. Alice (Evelyn Venable), a wealthy girl who is a volunteer social worker, brings the family a feast of a Thanksgiving dinner (in the book, they promptly sell it and buy cheaper food). Her fiance becomes involved, finally taking Jimmy to a hospital. Billy makes enough to take the family to a vaudeville variety show, and Mrs. Wiggs describes it all to Jimmy as he dies. She places an advertisement in national newspapers, directed to her husband, saying that Jimmy is dead and he must come home. Tabitha has found a man she likes (W. C. Fields), but fears he wont like her because she cant cook. Mrs. Wiggs conspires with her to serve an exquisite dinner. When he finds out the truth, he refuses to marry her, but she tells him she doesnt want someone who thinks only of his own pleasure and throws him out. In the midst of all this, Mr. Wiggs arrives and sits quietly in a corner until he is noticed. Hes got enough money to pay off the mortgage, and everyone lives happily ever after.
