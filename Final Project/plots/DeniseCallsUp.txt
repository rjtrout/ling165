Linda (Aida Turturro) wakes up one morning to her ringing phone. Her friend, Gale (Dana Wheeler Nicholson) wants to know how her party went last night. To her dismay, Linda tells her that no one showed up. "Not a one." Thus begins Denise Calls Up, the story of seven friends living in New York City who no longer find it necessary to actually meet face to face due to the new age of the internet and wireless phones. But Gale is less upset about the absolute absenteeism, than about the fact that her friend Barbara (Caroleen Feeney) never got to meet Jerry (Liev Schreiber). Gale has been trying to set them up. So she calls Barbara, chastising her for not making it to Lindas and goading her into meeting Jerry. After protesting that shes just been too busy, Barbara eventually acquieces. Meanwhile, Denise (Alanna Ubach), who has gotten pregnant by an anonymous sperm insemination, locates the donor, Martin (Dan Gunther) and decides to call him. And so it goes, as the characters, via phone and fax, duck and miss each other time after time, using one excuse after the other to avoid meetings, births, and even a funeral until, finally, Frank (Tim Daly) determined to finally get everyone together, plans a New Years Eve party. All swear that they will be there.
