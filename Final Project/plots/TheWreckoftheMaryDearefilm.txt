The steamship Mary Deare is found adrift at sea by salvager John Sands (Charlton Heston). Sands boards it hoping to claim it for salvage, but finds the first officer, Gideon Patch (Gary Cooper), still aboard and trying to run the ship on his own. Patch has stayed on the ship in order to prove that it was sabotaged to collect insurance on cargo that had secretly been off-loaded at Rangoon. Patch convinces Sands to help him beach the ship on the reefs of the Minquiers, even though it will void his salvage claim. When they return to London, Patch is brought before a board of inquiry to determine what happened. It soon becomes apparent that the ship owners were planning to wreck the Mary Deare all along and have Patch as the fall guy.
