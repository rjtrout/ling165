She is joined by nightclub entertainer Larry Todd (Martin) who, believing he has killed a mobster, flees New York with a friend, Myron (Lewis). Once on the island the three enter the eerie castle and, after viewing the ghost of one of Marys ancestors and fighting off a menacing zombie, find the key to the castles treasure.
