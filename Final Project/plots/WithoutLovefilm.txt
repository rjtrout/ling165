Lonely widow Jamie Rowan (Katharine Hepburn) helps the war effort by marrying a military research scientist, Patrick Jamieson (Spencer Tracy on film, Elliott Nugent on the stage), who has set up his lab in her house in Washington, D.C. Patrick has had all the worst of love and Jamie, all the best. They both believe that a marriage could be a success without love, as it reduces the chances of jealousy and bickering and all the other marital disadvantages. But as the film progresses, the inevitable happens as they begin to fall in love with each other. In the movie, Jamies house is at 481 Connecticut Avenue, N.W. In real life there is no 481 Connecticut Avenue, N.W. in D.C. Connecticut Avenue begins at the 800 block. If Connecticut Avenue were extended further south, 481 would be near the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion.
