In Panama, infamous nightclub hostess Carlotta (Tallulah Bankhead) kills in a struggle a man in self-defence and is put on trial for murder. Her defence counsel is Dick Grady (Fredric March), a lawyer who has become an alcoholic. When he proves Carlottas innocence, however, Dick regains respect and new employment through Roger Metcalf (Harry Davenport (actor)). He also manages to save Carlotta from committing suicide. He lends her money, and they both dream up a new identity for her as "Ann Trevor," and she moves to New York. Through various letters and repayment checks, Dick learns that "Ann Trevor" is happy and successful and he soon realizes he is in love with her. In the meantime Ann is successfully working in New York as interior decorator, sharing an apartment with her boss, Helen Grace (Lily Cahill). One customer, Larry Gordon (Scott Kolk), is so enthusiastic about Anns work, that he falls in love with her. When Roger Metcalf comes to a dinner with Larry, his mother and Ann, Roger recognizes her and calls Dick to come along. Ann is somehow forced to tell Larry the truth about her past. And after that the relationship breaks apart. Finally Dick moves to New York, buys the cottage Larry had bought for her, and calls in the shop to send him Ann Trevor for remodeling. They confess their love for each other, and they walk together through the entrance of the cottage.
