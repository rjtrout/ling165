Danny Hawkins (Dane Clark) is the son of a murderer who was hanged for his crimes. Haunted by his fathers past already in his childhood, the young man is tormented by the young people of the small southern town in which he lives. Hawkins only friend is Gilly Johnson (Gail Russell), a girl who is quickly falling in love with him. When Hawkins kills her bully boyfriend Jerry Sykes (Lloyd Bridges) (who by the way was one of the children tormenting him since early years) in self-defense, he fears the same fate as his father. When the dead body is found and Sheriff Clem Otis (Allyn Joslyn) starts closing in, Danny becomes crazed. He jumps off a Ferris wheel and nearly strangles the harmless mute Billy Scripture (Harry Morgan) who found Hawkins pocket knife near the body. While hiding out in the swamps, Hawkins visits his Grandma (Barrymore) who tells him the truth about his fathers crime. Hawkins realizes hes not tainted by "bad blood" and turns himself in to the police.
