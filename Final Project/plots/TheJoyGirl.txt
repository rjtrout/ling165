Jewel Courage (Borden) rejects a suitor (Hamilton), whom she thinks is a chauffeur, in favor of a man she thinks is a millionaire. It transpires that the roles were, in fact, reversed; Hamilton is the millionaire and the other man a chauffeur. Jewel is crushed but manages to do well for herself in business, until she and the real millionaire find themselves reconciled.
