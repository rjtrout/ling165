Wealthy car manufacturer James Alden (George Arliss) is forced to retire by his physician, Dr. Harvey (J. C. Nugent). However, idleness soon bores him. He takes the advice of brash life insurance salesman Schofield (James Cagney) and buys half interest in a gas station from Peterson (Noah Beery) without telling his wife Laura (real-life spouse Florence Arliss) or socialite daughter Barbara Babs Alden (Evalyn Knapp). As he is known nationwide, he uses the alias Charles Miller. He and new partner William Bill Merrick (David Manners) quickly discover that they have been swindled. A new highway opens the next day and Petersons new gas station takes nearly all their business away. Refusing to give up, James convinces Bill to borrow $1000 from his aunt to build a new gas station right across the street from Petersons. Bill is an architect, so he does the design work. With James business sense, they thrive, while Peterson languishes. One day, Babs stops at the station for gas. Bill recognizes her (they met once at a dance when they were attending the same university) and strikes up a conversation. Soon, Babs is a frequent customer. James is secretly pleased, as he disapproved of the rich idler she had been dating, Carter Andrews (Bramwell Fletcher), but publicly he discourages his daughter from seeing someone not of their lofty social rank. In the end, Peterson buys James and Bill out (at a substantial profit to them). Bill finally works up the courage to speak to Babs father about marrying her and is stunned to learn his future in-laws identity.
