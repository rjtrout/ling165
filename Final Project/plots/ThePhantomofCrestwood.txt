Ricardo Cortez plays Gary Curtis (alias Farnsbarns), a PI in New York who is known for skirting the law. Curtis is sent to get some letters from Jenny Wren (Karen Morley), who is a courtesan. Wren tells Priam Andes (H. B. Warner) to have some of her former lovers come to a gathering at Crestwood. At the gathering, she tells her former lovers that she is leaving but wants money from all of them, and explains that a boy she was trifling with committed suicide. Later that night Jenny Wren is killed. A road washed out keeps everyone at Crestwood. Now Gary Curtis must find out who the murderer is before the police arrive and pin it on him.
