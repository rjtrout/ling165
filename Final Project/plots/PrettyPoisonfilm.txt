Dennis Pitt is a disturbed young man on parole from a mental institution who becomes attracted to teenager Sue Ann Stepenek. He tells her that he is a secret agent, and takes her along on a series of "missions". Things, however, turns out disastrously when Dennis takes Sue Ann along to sabotage a factory on imaginary orders from the CIA, during which the couple encounters the factorys night watchman, as Sue Ann knocks the watchman unconscious and then drowns him. While Dennis is wracked with guilt over both what he has done and what he has allowed to happen, Sue Ann is excited by the "adventure" and entreats Dennis to run away with her to Mexico. First, however, they have to get rid of her disapproving mother. However, as the couple return to Sue Anns home for her clothes and are interrupted by the arrival of Mrs. Stepanek, Sue Ann realizes that Dennis is incapable of actually killing a person, so she shoots her mother and orders Dennis to dispose of the body. But instead, he calls the police. Dennis knows that the police will take Sue Anns word over his, so he makes no effort to defend himself in court and takes the blame for their crimes. Sue Ann, meanwhile, betrays him without a second thought, sending him to prison for life. Dennis is more than happy to be locked up, as it keeps him away from Sue Ann, of whom he is now quite frightened. While Dennis refuses to tell his skeptical parole officer Azenauer the truth, he asks him to "see what Sue Ann is up to" in hopes she will be exposed for what she really is. The film ends with Sue Ann meeting a young man and lamenting to him that the people who took her in after her mothers death wont let her stay out late; it is implied that she will use and destroy him just as she did Dennis. But Dennis parole officer is indeed watching as she departs with her latest victim.
