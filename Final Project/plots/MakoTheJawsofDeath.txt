Sonny Stein, who is played by Richard Jaeckel, learns while working as a marine salvager in the Philippine Islands, that he has a connection with Mako sharks, and is given a medallion by a Filipino shaman. Becoming alienated from society, Stein lives alone in a small stilt house offshore of Key West, Florida. He develops an ability to telepathically communicate with sharks. He then sets out to destroy anybody who harms sharks. People enter into his strange world to exploit his abilities and his shark "friends", including an unethical shark research scientist and a morbidly obese strip club owner (Buffy Dee) who wants to use a shark in his dancers acts. Stein then uses these sharks to get revenge on anybody he considers a threat. He later loses the medallion and is then killed by the sharks himself.
