The film is narrated by Charlotte Flax, a quirky and awkward 15-year old girl living in Oklahoma with her single, eccentric mother, Rachel (whom she calls "Mrs. Flax"), and her sweet nine-year-old sister, Kate. Rachels daughters have different fathersâ€”Charlotte is a product of a teenage romance and Kate is from an affair with an athlete. The narration begins in early fall of 1963. Just as Rachels latest fling with her married employer ends, she decides to relocate with Charlotte and Kate once again. This time, they move to a new home near a convent in the small town of Eastport, Massachusetts. Charlotte has an unusual obsession with Catholicism, strengthened by her mothers disapproval, and idolizes the nuns living in the convent. Kate, on the other hand, loves all things swimming and is an avid competitor, apparently getting it from Rachels Olympic one night stand from which she was conceived. In Eastport, Charlotte becomes especially interested in Joe Poretti, the 26-year-old handsome caretaker of the convent and local school bus driver, while Rachel falls in love with a local shop owner named Lou Landsky. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Charlotte finds Joe ringing the convent bell and consoles him. However, they begin to kiss and feeling filled with sin she flees. After the encounter, she begins fasting in order to purge her sinful thoughts, but eventually passes out from hunger and the fear of immaculate conception and starts eating again. Soon fearing that God may be punishing through pregnancy and unable to talk to her mother about it, she steals her car and runs away. She stops at the house of a "perfect nuclear family" in New Haven, Connecticut, asking to spend the night, telling them her name is Sal Val and other wild stories, which they dont seem to completely believe. Later on, she is picked up by Lou and taken home after the family reports her, where Charlotte immediately receives a harsh scolding from Rachel believing she could have been murdered. When Rachel calms down, she tells Charlotte that she was worried sick about her safety, and, thinking that its her fault that Charlotte ran away from home, admits that even though shes not an expert in parenting, shes willing to compromise and try her best to take care of both Charlotte and Kate. The next day, Charlotte makes an appointment at the nearest clinic under the name Joan Arc, where she sees an obstetrician and is told she is still a virgin and therefore cannot be pregnant. Relieved, she goes home, dispelled of her assumption that "one kiss can get you pregnant". At a New Years Eve costume party sometime after a large fight with Lou, he asks Rachel to marry/move in with him but she declines both, reminding him that hes still married. However, shes not willing to break up with him nor let their relationship progress either. This ends with Lou calmly leaving in disappointment. Rachel then asks Joe for a ride home, before she wishes him a happy New Year and kisses him. Charlotte sees this and feels that her mother is trying to steal him away. The night after the incident, Charlotte dresses up in Rachels clothes and makeup in an attempt to show that she can be just as appealing as her mother. She and Kate get drunk on wine and talk on the porch about Kates birth. Hearing the church bells ringing, Charlotte then takes Kate to the convent and tells her that shell be back. Kate decides to drunkenly collect rocks while Charlotte goes up to the bell tower to find Joe, where they have sex. Unbeknownst to them, Kate falls into a river and almost drowns due to her inebriation, but is saved by the nuns and is taken to the hospital. Outraged at the turn of events, Rachel and Charlotte argue, eventually leading to an understanding of each other as mother and daughter and not just friends. Charlotte convinces Rachel to stay in Eastport for at least another year. Time passes in the small town and Rachels relationship with Lou continues. Joe moves to California and opens up a plant nursery, but keeps in touch with Charlotte via postcards. Charlotte, in turn, gains a reputation in high school due to her sexual encounter with Joe and replaces her Catholicism obsession with Greek mythology and a less conservative look; Rachel now reminding her that they are not Greek. Kate has recovered and is swimming again, although the accident left her hearing sometimes "sounding fuzzy". The film ends with all three of them dancing while setting the table for dinner.
