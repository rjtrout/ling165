The Stooges operate the Jive Cafe and are enduring significant debt. They reluctantly take a second job hanging posters (Ã  la Three Little Twirps), earning a penny for each poster hung. Moe takes notice of one particular poster advertising a cow milking contest that pays $100 to the winner. Without hesitation, Moe and Larry nominate Curly for the contest, and go about looking for a cow to practice milking on. They coincidentally find a "cow" (a bull) behind the fence. Curly is no match for the wild animal, and he is quickly booted over a fence twice, then up onto a telephone pole. When the contest day arrives, Curly (nicknamed K. O. Bossy) cannot squeeze an ounce of milk from the cows udder. While fresh cows are being brought in for the second round, Moe and Larry jump into a cow costume with a jug of milk. The scheme works until Curly yanks the mock udder off the jug, and the milk comes gushing out which caused Curly to be disqualified. After the contests champion throws all of the stooges off the stage, they are left helping each other leaving while being booed at by the audience because they were cheating.
