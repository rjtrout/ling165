The story revolves around three married couples living in New York City who take vacations together during each of the seasons. After this pattern has been established, Nick leaves his wife of 21 years, Anne, during the Spring trip to the cabin, for a much younger woman, Ginny. He then proceeds to bring Ginny on the Summer, Fall, and Winter vacation trips. This causes the other two couples to be uncomfortable, feeling as if they have betrayed their good friend Anne.
