While their submarine is docked in New York City, three sailors on liberty invest the money theyve earned at sea in a Broadway musical and its up-and-coming star. Choirboy Jones (Gordon MacRae) carries a gunnysack stuffed with $50,000 in cash from his fellow sailors. Joe Woods (Sam Levene), producing a new show starring the singer Emilio Rossi (George Givot), is delighted to find a new investor, but female lead Penny Weston (Jane Powell) is worried that the boys are in over their heads. After the shows out-of-town opening is a flop, Woods, Rossi and even the author want out. Penny consults some distinguished Broadway artists for their advice, which includes casting the talented singer Jones, dancer Twitch (Gene Nelson) and comic Porky (Jack E. Leonard) in key roles. The show is a smash and the sailors reap a handsome return on their investment, with Jones and Penny falling in love as a bonus.
