Nomadic, flaky Caroline Wolff (Ellen Barkin) wants to settle down, find a decent man, and provide a better home for her and her son, Tobias "Toby" Wolff (Leonardo DiCaprio). When she moves to Seattle, Washington, and meets Dwight Hansen (Robert De Niro), she thinks she has accomplished her goals. However, Dwights true personality is revealed after Toby spends a few months separated from his mother with Dwight and his children. Dwight seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but his methods include emotional, verbal, and physical abuse. The marriage proceeds, and Caroline recognizes Dwights need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Toby befriends a classmate, the misfit and ambiguously gay Arthur Gayle (Jonah Blechman). Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for East Coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not good enough to be accepted, he plans to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby, saying he is behaving more and more like Dwight. Arthur helps his friend get the papers he needs to falsify his grade records, and Toby submits his prep-school applications. After numerous rejections, he is accepted by the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, with a full scholarship. At the end of the film, Caroline defends Toby from Dwight during a physically violent argument, and they both leave Dwight and the town of Concrete. The real Dwight died in 1992. Caroline remarried and moved to Florida. Arthur left Concrete and became a successful businessman in Italy. Dwights children all married and stayed in Seattle.
