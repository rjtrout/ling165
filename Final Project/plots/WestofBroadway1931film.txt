Jerry Stevens is a Chicago millionaire whose fiancee Anne falls for another man while Jerrys off to war. Jerry ends up escorting two young ladies, roommates Dot and Maizie, to a party, and when Anne turns up there with her new lover, a jealous Jerry lies and introduces Dot as his new love. Dot goes along with the gag and has been kind to Jerry all evening, so much so that, after having too many drinks, he proposes marriage to Dot and takes her to a justice of the peace. He wakes up having little or no recollection of what occurred. Recognizing that he has a drinking problem, Dot becomes determined to help Jerry regain sobriety. Annoyed that she wont grant a divorce, Jerry leaves for a ranch he owns in Arizona, only to find Dot there waiting for him. She doesnt fall for his fib that he is ill and has six months to live. But when he goes to greater lengths to get rid of her, Dot gives up and goes back home, declining his offer of $10,000. Anne is available again, but it gradually dawns on Jerry that the woman he really loves is Dot.
