Steve Kendall is an American telegraph operator aboard a cargo ship. He inadvertently discovers that his ship is carrying contraband arms, when a revolutionary agent forces him to send a message to the revolutionaries ashore. When the secret police catch him catch the two together, the revolutionary flees, but is shot dead as he attempts to jump overboard. Seeing the two of them together, the police mistakenly believe Kendall to be in league with the local revolutionaries. Nearing port, Kendall dives overboard and swims to ashore in a foreign country. Being chased by the militia and police, he winds up meeting a local member of the revolutionary party, Nedra. It is discovered that Nedra was the sister of the man killed by the police on the boat, and Nedras group had been planning to hijack the illegal arms which Kendalls ship was carrying. Nedra introduces Kendall to Tio, an American expatriate who runs a local dance hall. Tio agrees to hide him in the basement of the hall, while Nedra tries to figure a way to smuggle Kendall out of the country. Eventually Nedra arranges transport for Kendall on a steamship heading north, but before he can make good his escape, the police descend on Tios, forcing not only Kendall to flee, but Tio and his friend, Studs, as well. The police chase them via speedboat, heading them off at the steamship. The group heads back to land, where Tio radios a call for help. After a gunfight, the foursome escape via seaplane to the United States, where, after they arrive, Nedra tearfully lets them know that she has to go back and help her comrades in their fight for freedom.
