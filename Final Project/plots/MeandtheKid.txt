A couple of ex-cons, Harry (Danny Aiello) and Roy (Joe Pantoliano), break into a home expecting to find $250,000 in a safe, but come away empty-handed. They do, however, take 8-year-old Gary (Alex Zuckerman) with them, hoping that the boys father will pay a ransom. Harry forms a bond with Gary, who has multiple allergies, is home-schooled and has rarely been out in the world. Roy resents the kid-glove treatment of the boy and becomes at odds with his partner over what to do with him. In the end, things between Roy and Harry get violent but Gary saves Harrys life. While Gary enjoys life with Harry much more than his home life, things get too dangerous and Harry is forced to leave him behind. However, Gary aids Harry in escaping from the authorities. Sometime later, Harry visits Gary at home and the two leave together once more, heading for Mexico to start a new life.
