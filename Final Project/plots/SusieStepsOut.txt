Jeffrey Westcott is a popular singer. He is represented by Starrs advertising agency and attracted to Clara Russell, a secretary there. Clara and her 15-year-old sister Susie are concerned because their father, a cello player, is currently unable to work. Susie lies that she is 19 and lands a job singing in a nightclub. Jeffrey goes to the club with Starr and can tell that the girl is underage, even though he is unaware Clara is her sister. He takes her home, where Clara tracks him down and accuses him mistakenly of improper behavior. Starrs wife believes he is having an affair with his secretary and therefore sees to it that Clara is fired. Susie confronts her and explains all.
