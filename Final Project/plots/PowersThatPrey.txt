Burton Grant exposes politician Jarvis McVey as a crook in a newspaper and is run out of town. He asks his daughter Sylvia to turn his job at the Daily News over to editor Frank Summers. Sylvia has inherited her fathers talents and decides to fire Frank and take over the newspaper herself. Meanwhile, Frank finds out McVey is involved in a scheme concerning the city franchise. When Sylvia is informed, she publishes the news. She publishes stories about merchants who do not do business in ways that she believes are correct, which almost ruins the paper. Soon, the townspeople are after her and her father comes back to protect her against the outraged townsfolk, while Frank concerns about proving her reliability. She is successful in preventing McVey from furthering his graft policies, and becomes engaged to Frank.
