Twin brothers David and Tom Cook go their separate ways, David as a lawman, Tom as an outlaw. The latter is in league with a corrupt sheriff, McDaniels, and at odds with two members of his gang, Hardman and Marsden. The honest, upright David has few allies except for an elderly uncle, Hardtack. Saloon singer Phyllis OConover is in love with Tom, even though he has gone bad. Due to a case of mistaken identities, she ends up married to his twin. Tom considers this unforgivable, even though Phyllis was sincerely in love with him, and kills her. David, meanwhile, falls in love with Phylliss jealous older sister, Julie. Hardman and Marsden are ultimately done away with, leading to a showdown between the twins. Tom has the drop on David and appears to be the victory until he is shot dead by their uncle.
