A competition is held between two brothers on their fathers ski slopes; one is a skier, the other a snowboarder. The competition would determine if snowboarders could be allowed to be a part the ski patrol. Into the scene arrives Rudy James, played by Jim Varney who stumbles his way into a job as ski patrol, entertainment host, and jack of all trades. What was cut out of the film was that Rudy James was hired by Mimi, played by Brigitte Nielsen, to ineptly sabotage the ski hill so that she could win it in a divorce proceeding. The two brothers discover her plot to damage their fathers ski hill (played by SCTVs Joe Flaherty) and further hilarity ensues. While nearly uncommon today, there was a time when snowboarding was banned from many worldclass resorts, resulting in the concept of poaching. Writer/producer, Rudy Rupak, who was an avid skier trying to learn how to snowboard, seized upon this interesting concept to mine it for its subversive comedic value. Subsequently though Columbia Pictures removed all references to poaching from the script.
