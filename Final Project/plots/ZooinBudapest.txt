Flamboyant Zani (Gene Raymond) is a kindly young man who grew up entirely and works in the zoo in Budapest. His only true friends are the zoos animals, and indeed Zani (Gene Raymond) has been chastised by his boss for being too nice to them. From the fashionable women visitors who wear them, Zani steals their animal furs. While hiding out, Zani meets Eve (Loretta Young), a young and beautiful orphan girl. Eve must somehow escape from her strict orphan school, since she is faced with the prospect of being forced to work as an indentured servant (more like a slave) until she grows up. Zani and Eve together hide overnight in the zoo. Dr. Grunbaum (O.P. Heggie), the zoo director, is forced to organize a search party. Zani proves too elusive and harbors Eve in a bear cave. When evil zookeeper Heinie discovers them, Zani saves Eve from vicious attack. More scuffles result in crisis when dangerous animals become freed from their cages. The resourceful Zani brings pacification and redeems himself by saving a young child from a hungry tiger.
