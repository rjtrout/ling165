A brilliant research psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Venner, is driven out of Budapest by another researcher who has taken false credit for Venners work. After going to London, Dr. Venner is offered a job in a Scottish sanitarium where he can continue his research on dementia precox, a disease from which his father had suffered. Mary Murray, a young, pretty doctor, becomes his laboratory assistant. They fall in love, though she has plans to go to China to engage in medical missionary work in a years time. Paul convinces her to remain with him, and the two become betrothed. A fire breaks out in the lab and Mary tragically dies in an effort to salvage Pauls valuable records. The deeply distressed doctor turns down several posts at prestigious universities in order to realize Marys dream of helping the sick in China. The working title of the film was Winged Victory, but this was changed after it was learned that Moss Hart was writing a play with that title. Harts Winged Victory was filmed in 1944.
