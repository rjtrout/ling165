Close friends Anne Carr (Mary Ann Mobley) and Helen Todd (Lana Wood) move into a singles complex where every tenant must be unmarried and under 30. A couple of neighbors make a wager with bachelor playboy Bret Hendley (John Saxon) that he cant seduce Anne successfully. Bret is too much a gentleman to accept, but when Anne learns the money would pay for Brets college education, she willingly goes along with a romance. Mr. Parker (Milton Berle), the buildings manager, throws an engagement party for Bret and Anne, then proceeds to evict them from the premises. While they work through their issues, Helen endures a traumatic experience, making her consider giving up men for good.
