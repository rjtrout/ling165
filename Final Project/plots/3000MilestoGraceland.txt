Outside of Las Vegas, Michael Zane, a recent parolee, stops at a run-down desert motel. There, he catches a boy, Jesse, stealing the deaths head wheel nuts off his cars wheels and chases him, meeting his mother, Cybil Waingrow, whom he later beds. The following morning four men dressed in Elvis costumes arrive to pick him up: Murphy, Hanson, Gus, and Franklin. Together they set off into Vegas to a casino holding an Elvis convention intent on robbing it â€” dressed as Elvis impersonators. Michael rigs the elevator while the others rob the cages and counting room, and after a grotesquely violent firefight, Franklin is killed during their escape. Back at the motel, Hanson starts an argument about who gets Franklins share and Murphy shoots and kills Hanson. Michael hides the money in the crawl space, unaware that Jesse is observing him from the next room. The three thieves drive out to the middle of the desert to bury Hanson. Offscreen, Murphy shoots Gus and Michael as well. It is later revealed that Michael was wearing a bulletproof vest and played dead. He starts running back to the motel hoping to get there before Murphy does. Driving from the scene, Murphy hits a coyote, skids off the road, and is knocked unconscious after crashing his car. Michael gets back to the motel. Discovering the money is missing, he storms into Cybils place and finds the money where Jesse has hidden it. Michael gives Cybil $100,000 in exchange for her silence, but is eventually manipulated into taking Cybil and Jesse along with him. Michael explains to Cybil that the money is marked, but that Murphy has found a money launderer in Idaho to help them. Murphy, who has since returned to the motel and discovered that the money is missing, has decided to go to Idaho to wait for them. Cybil sneaks away from Michael and her son at a restaurant, stealing Michaels wallet and car. Cybil calls the money launderer, using the password that she has extracted from Michaels wallet. Murphy suddenly appears at the money launderer, Peterson, (Jon Lovitz), using the same password. Peterson explains that Cybil called first, so they wait for her. Finally, Cybil arrives, and finds only Murphy, whom she assumes is Peterson. Soon afterwards, Michael and Jesse, who have been stealing money and cars to survive, arrive and find Peterson and his secretary dead in the bathroom. Realizing that Murphy killed the two and remembering that Murphy is driving Michaels car, Michael reports his car stolen. Murphy is then arrested. However, Michael is arrested as well when police discover that Michael is also driving a stolen car. The men are then put in adjoining cells and the two have a confrontation. Michael makes bail, thanks to Jesse, who hired a lawyer, under the agreement that Michael make him his partner. Murphy calls a man named Jack (Howie Long) and arranges to get out as well. Michael, who has been allowed to retrieve his car, finds Cybil tied up and gagged in the trunk. Murphy makes bail and is picked up by a passerby while hitchhiking, he then kills the man and takes his clothes and vehicle. Murphy sees Cybil and Jesse pass by in a car. He runs them off the road, and grabs Jesse, to hold as collateral, telling Cybil to find Michael and the money. Cybil finds Michael and begs him to help her. After initially disbelieving her, Michael decides to help her, reporting Murphy to the authorities. Murphy has met up with Jack, who has enlisted the help of a shadowy figure named Hamilton (Ice-T). Michael appears with the money and convinces Murphy to hand Jesse over. Just as Murphy realizes that Michael tricked him by replacing the money with cut up newspaper, he is stung by a scorpion that Michael hid in the bag. Suddenly, a SWAT team surround the warehouse. Murphy puts his hands up, but quickly grabs a nearby shotgun and shoots Michael. A gunfight ensues; Jack and Hamilton are killed. Murphy, getting weaker from the scorpion sting, refuses to lose, and he is shot and killed by the police. Michael is rushed by ambulance to the nearest hospital. However, the ambulance is stolen by Cybil and Jesse. Its then revealed that Michael, once again, wore a bulletproof vest, and is only slightly injured.
