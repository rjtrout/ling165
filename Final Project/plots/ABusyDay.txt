In A Busy Day, a wife (played by an energetic Charlie Chaplin) becomes jealous of her husbands interest in another woman during a military parade. On her way to attack the couple, the wife interrupts the set of a film, knocking over a film director and a police officer. Finally, the husband pushes the wife off a pier and she falls into the harbor.
