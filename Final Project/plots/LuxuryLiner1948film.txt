A captain of cruise ships, Jeremy Bradford use a brief leave to visit Polly, his teenaged daughter. He takes her to see the opera Aida, where she is entranced by the singing talents of Olaf Eriksen and Zita Romanka. On learning that Olaf and Zita will be passengers on her dads voyage to Rio de Janeiro, she begs to come along, but Capt. Bradford says no. He is furious when he finds out that Polly is on board as a stowaway, and puts her to work in the ships kitchen. Also on board is a jilted bride, Laura Dene, and her fiance Charles, who is still thinking things over. Polly strikes up a friendship with Laura, who isnt aware at first that the girl is the captains daughter. Polly is forgiven by Capt. Bradford, who permits her to sing a duet with Olaf aboard ship. Polly is equally pleased when her dad develops a romantic interest in Laura, which turns out to be mutual.
