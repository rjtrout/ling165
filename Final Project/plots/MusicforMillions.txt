"Mike" (Margaret OBrien), age 6, arrives in New York to stay with her pregnant older sister Barbara Ainsworth (June Allyson), who lives together with a group of young women, her co-players in a symphony orchestra. As the orchestra prepares to go on a tour of army camps, a telegram is received informing them of the death of Barbaras soldier husband in the Pacific war theater. The girls decide to keep the tragic news from her until after her baby is born. The orchestra is shown playing several classical standards before various military audiences. The talented Iturbi variously conducts the group as well as effortlessly plays difficult piano pieces, while Durante sings comically and acts as a grandfather figure to Mike. In a surprise ending, just after giving birth, Barbara receives a letter from her husband saying he is in good spirits and convalescing in a military hospital.
