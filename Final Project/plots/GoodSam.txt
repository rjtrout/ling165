Sam Clayton is too good for his own good. A sermon by Rev. Daniels persuades him to help others in every way he can, including his wife Lus good-for-nothing brother, Claude, whos been living with them rent-free for six months, and their neighbors the Butlers, who need a car for a vacation when theirs breaks down. Sam is a department store manager whose boss, H.C. Borden, wants him to sell more and socialize less. Sams a shoulder for clerk Shirley Mae to cry on when her romance breaks up. He also gives a $5,000 loan, without his wifes knowledge, to Mr. and Mrs. Adams, who need it to save a gas station they bought. Lu is fed up with Sams generosity, particularly when he ends up paying for the Butlers car repairs, then letting the mechanic come over for home-cooked meals. The last straw for Lu comes when she learns they have a chance to put a down payment on a new house, except Sam has lent their nest egg to the Adamses. Sam is unhappy, too. Hes annoyed with the Butlers, who have crashed his car and cant pay to fix it. He also wants Claude to move out. Shirley Maes troubles come to his door after she takes too many pills. Sam even gets robbed, and the bank refuses to make him a loan. He is at his wits end when the Adamses surprise him with a check for $6,000. They also give Claude a job, and Shirley Mae suddenly thinks she and Claude could have a future together. Sam and Lu feel better about life, particularly when Borden surprises him with a promotion at work.
