Butch Rogers (Pat OBrien) and Sock McGillis (Wayne Morris) are old submarine hands stationed in Panama. On land, Butch and Sock battle over pretty Ann Sawyer (Doris Weston). At sea and underwater, however, our two heroes are virtually inseparable. This film offers many insights into the U.S. Navy submarine force just prior to World War II. Use of the Momsen lung for emergency submarine rescues is featured as well as the training tank structures of New London, Connecticut submarine base. The film also has exceptional footage of the U.S. Fleet, including USS Cincinnati, Farragut class destroyers and many battleships. One can also hear the men singing the Sub Division 9 song.
