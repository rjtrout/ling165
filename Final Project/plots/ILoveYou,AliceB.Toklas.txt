Attorney Harold Fine (Sellers) is forced into setting a date for marriage by his secretary/fiancée Joyce (a bimbo). Because of a fender bender, he ends up driving a hippie vehicle, a psychedelically-painted station wagon. At the funeral of his familys butcher he encounters his brother, Herbie, a hippie living in Venice Beach. Herbies girlfriend, an attractive flower power hippie girl named Nancy (Leigh Taylor-Young), takes a liking to Harold and makes him pot brownies. However, she departs without telling him, and not knowing what they are he eats them and feeds them to his father, mother, and fiancée, who dissolve in laughter and silliness. Harold considers the "trip" a revelation, and begins renouncing aspects of his "straight" life. He tells his fiancée "no" at the chuppah, starts living with Nancy, and tries to find himself with the aid of a guru, whose name is Guru. Ultimately he discovers the hippie lifestyle is as unfulfilling and unsatisfying as his old lifestyle—Nancy says that monogamy "isnt hip"—and once more decides to marry Joyce. At the last minute, he again leaves her at the altar and runs out of the wedding onto a city street saying he doesnt know for sure what he is looking for but, "theres got to be something beautiful out there." Additional characters include a large Mexican family all wearing neck braces (an automobile accent; Harolds a lawyer). He hallucinates that two very non-identical fraternal twin Jewish cantors at his wedding are also in neck braces.
