In November 1918, at the end of World War I. A private, using his trench knife, slays a German soldier, who was approaching with his arms raised and speaking in German. When he returns to his companys headquarters, the private is told that the "wars been over for four hours." In November 1942, the soldier, now a sergeant in the "Big Red One", leads his squad of infantrymen through North Africa, where they are initially fired on by a Vichy French general, who is then overpowered by his French troops who are loyal to Free France. Over the next two years, the squad serves in campaigns in Sicily, where they are given intelligence by a peasant boy, and are fed by grateful women, Omaha Beach at the start of the Normandy Campaign, the liberation of France where they battle Germans inside a mental asylum, and the invasion of western Germany. The sergeants German counterpart, Schroeder, participates in many of the same battles and displays a ruthless loyalty to Hitler and Germany. At different times, he and the sergeant express the same sentiment that soldiers are killers, but not murderers. During the advance across northern France, the squad crosses the same field where the sergeant killed the surrendering German at the start of the film, where a memorial now stands. The squads final action in the war is the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. Shortly after this, the sergeant is in a forest at night, having just buried a young boy he had befriended earlier after liberating the camp. Schroeder approaches, attempting to surrender, but the sergeant stabs him. His squad then arrives, and informs him that the war ended "about four hours ago." This time, as the squad walks away, Pvt. Griff notices that Schroeder is still alive; the sergeant and his men work frantically to save his life as they return to their encampment.
