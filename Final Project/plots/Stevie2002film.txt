In 1995, James returned to Pomona, a rural town in Southern Illinois, USA. After 10 years with no contact, he attempts to reconnect with Stevie Fielding, a troubled young boy to whom he had been an Advocate Big Brother. Jamess re-entry into Stevies life is brief. The story then picks up again about two years later after Stevie is charged with a serious crime. Through interviews with Stevie and his family and friends, James paints the portrait of a man who is still very troubled, while he tries to understand what led Stevie down the path of self-destruction.
