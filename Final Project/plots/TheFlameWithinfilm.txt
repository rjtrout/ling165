A suicidal woman, Lillian Belton (Maureen OSullivan), unsuccessfully attempts suicide by taking pills, and she is referred to a psychiatrist for therapy. While at the psychiatrist, Lillian attempts suicide again by trying to jump out the window, and she is only stopped by the psychiatrist, Dr. Mary White (Ann Harding). Dr. White learns that Lillian’s troubles are connected to Jack Kerry, (Louis Hayward) who she contacted just prior to her attempt with the psychiatrist. Lillian loves Jack, but he is an alcoholic and does not love Lillian the way she loves him. Dr. White contacts Jack, and persuades him to seek treatment for his alcoholism. As Jack completes his treatment, he falls in love with Dr. White, but the Dr. reminds Jack of Lillian’s need for him, and Jack and Lillian marry. Lillian’s physician, Dr. Gordon Phillips (Herbert Marshall), is also in love with Dr. White, but cannot convince her to leave her patients and her practice. Dr. White encounters Lillian and Jack at a costume ball, and Jack manages to get a dance with Dr. White, as a suspicious Lillian looks on. Jack confesses his love for Dr. White, but she again reminds him of his marriage and commitment to Lillian. An enraged Lillian creates a scene with Dr, White, who uses this experience as a parallel of her and Dr. Phillips’ relationship.
