Vince Majestyk (Charles Bronson) is a farmer, an ex-con, a former U. S. Army Ranger instructor and Vietnam War veteran, who owns and operates a watermelon farm in rural Colorado. He needs to harvest his crop in order to keep the farm financially solvent. A small-time hoodlum, Bobby Kopas (Paul Koslo), attempts to coerce Majestyk into a protection racket of using unskilled drunks to harvest his watermelon crop. Majestyk runs him off with Kopass own 12 gauge Winchester Model 1200 shotgun and hires skilled Mexican migrant workers, including Nancy Chavez (Linda Cristal), a crops picker union leader. They begin a relationship. Kopas brings assault charges against Majestyk, resulting in the farmer being placed under arrest. In jail, Majestyk meets and annoys Frank Renda (Al Lettieri), a notorious mob hit man being transferred to a higher-security prison. Rendas men try to break him out of police custody during a prisoner transport by bus. In the escape attempt, Majestyk drives off in the bus with Renda still in handcuffs. Majestyk plans on trading Renda to the police in return for being released to finish his harvest. Renda offers his captor $25,000 for his freedom, but Majestyk just wants to get back and pick his melons. With the help of his girlfriend Wiley (Lee Purcell), Renda escapes from Majestyk. He meets up with his right-hand man Lundy (Taylor Lacher) and is advised to fly to Mexico to elude a police dragnet, but Renda wants revenge. He orders his men to find the "melon picker" so that he can have the satisfaction of killing him personally. Renda injures a friend of Majestyk and destroys the crop. Majestyk turns the tables. He sets a trap at Rendas cabin hideout. Renda betrays his own men, leading to Lundys death. He attempts to use Kopas as bait to lure out Majestyk, but when Kopas lies, Majestyk doesnt believe it. He kills Renda, after which Kopas and Wiley are arrested.
