Ken McLaughlins (Roddy McDowall) mare Flicka gives birth to an all-white colt that, unknown to Kens dad, Rob (Preston Foster), was actually sired by a neighboring ranchers thoroughbred racehorse, Appalachia, rather than Robs own stallion, Banner. Kens mother, Nell (Rita Johnson), names the colt Thunderhead after the billowing white clouds she sees overhead. Ken trains Thunderhead as a race horse, but the colt suffers an injury during his first race, ending his racing career. Meanwhile, the Albino, a wild stallion that has been raiding local ranchers herds for years, steals Rob McLaughlins best mares and kills Banner, putting the family near bankruptcy. The Albino is also Thunderheads grand-sire. Rob, Ken, and the ranch hands search for the mares, but during the night, Thunderhead gets loose and runs off. Tracking Thunderhead on foot to a secluded valley, Ken discovers the Albinos herd, including his fathers horses. The Albino attacks Ken, but Thunderhead fights and kills the Albino, saving Kens life. Rob and the others arrive as Thunderhead rounds up the Albinos herd, heading them to the McLaughlin ranch. But once there, Thunderhead is uneasy. Rob tells Ken that Thunderhead is a king now and wants to roam his realm. Ken removes Thunderheads halter, freeing him.
