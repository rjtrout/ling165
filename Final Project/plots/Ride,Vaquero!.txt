Mexican bandit Jose Esqueda resents settlers in the Brownsville, Texas region, and conducts raids against them. He threatens to burn down homes, including the ranch house King Cameron has just built for his wife Cordelia. Rio, raised like a brother to Esqueda, joins forces with him at first. But in time he forms a partnership with Cameron instead, and even saves his life, although Cordelia continues not to trust him. Complications arise when Cordelias distrust turns to desire. Cameron must save both his property and his marriage after Esqueda goes on a rampage, robbing Brownsvilles bank and killing the sheriff. Shot several times by Esqueda and close to death, Cameron is once again saved by Rio, who confronts Esqueda in a final gunfight. Cameron forgives Cordelia for her feelings toward Rio.
Ride, Vaquero!
