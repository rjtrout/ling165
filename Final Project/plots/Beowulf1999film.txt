The setting is a post-industrial castle that defends the border of an unnamed kingdom. It is terrorized by a creature named Grendel, who kills the castles defenders, one by one. After fighting his way past several soldiers trying to keep anyone from entering or leaving, the warrior Beowulf offers his help to the castles king, Hrothgar, who welcomes his help. Hrothgar has a daughter named Kyra, who is loved by Roland, the castles strongest soldier, but she does not return his affections. It is revealed that Hrothgars wife (and Kyras mother) committed suicide when she found out Hrothgar had an affair. The woman he had an affair with was actually an ancient being who had originally lived on the castles lands. The affair resulted in an offspring, Grendel. Beowulf and Grendel fight, wounding each other. Later, after recovering, they fight again and this time Beowulf rips Grendels arm off with a retracting cestus. That night the castle celebrates as they believe Grendel is dead. Kyra declares her love for Beowulf and he returns her affection. Kyra tells him that she killed her previous husband after he abused her. Beowulf tells her that his mother is human and his father is Baal, "God of darkness, Lord of lies". This explains his tremendous fighting prowess. While Kyra is with Beowulf, everyone else in the castle is killed by Grendels mother. Grendel kills Hrothgar, after the truth of his heritage is revealed. Beowulf attacks and kills Grendel by stabbing him through the stump where his arm once was. Grendels mother appears and attempts to seduce Beowulf as she had done Hrothgar. Beowulf sets the castle on fire, which kills Grendels mother and completely consumes the building as he escapes with Kyra.
