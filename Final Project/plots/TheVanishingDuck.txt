George has bought wife Joan a singing duck named Quacker for her birthday, much to her delight. They then leave the house to go out, but Joan is worried about leaving Quacker alone in the house with Tom outside. Despite George assuring her, Tom sneaks inside behind the twos back and immediately goes to look for Quacker. Tom swallows the duckling, but Quacker escapes and retreats to Jerrys mouse hole. The two become friends. Tom grabs Quacker, but Jerry trips him with an extension cord, causing Tom to release Quacker, who flies straight into a tub of vanishing cream. Quacker turns himself invisible and returns the favour by saving Jerry from Tom. Jerry then joins his friend and the two turn invisible to have fun pranking Tom. The duckling and mouse eat Toms watermelon and spit the seeds at him, shove aspirin down his throat, jam his tail into a door and cut it short, and fool the cat with a disguise tail. A poor Tom is bamboozled, and Jerry and Quacker finally trap him in the house door and bash him outside with a coal shovel. As Jerry and Quacker celebrate their victory, the cat overhears them mention the vanishing cream, and sneaks behind them to test it on himself. Fed up of Jerry and Quackers playing and bullying, Tom gleefully decides to exact revenge and turn invisible to give Jerry and Quacker a taste of their own medicine. The mouse and duckling are happily gloating until the invisible cat hits them from behind with the coal shovel. Jerry and Quacker run away in fright as a victorious Tom chases them around the house, hitting them alternately with the coal shovel.
