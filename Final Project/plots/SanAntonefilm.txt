Confederate army officer Brian Culver comes to propose marriage to Julia Allerby, but she is distracted by Chino Figueroas plans to leave her ranch. She tries to persuade Chino to keep working for her, first by seducing him, which fails, then by false accusations that he attacked her. Culver is angry enough when civilian Carl Miller turns up with a troop movement that he, Miller, will lead. Carl is a friend of Chinos and in love with Chinos sister, Mistania. As usual, Julia intervenes and attempts to use her wiles on Carl, then becomes furious when he slaps her face. Riding through a canyon where he expects Culvers soldiers to be attacked, Carl and the soldiers are deserted by Culver and end up captured. By the time Carl is released and returns to San Antonio, Chino has taken some of Culvers men hostage while others have taken jobs with wealthy rancher John Chisum. Carl discovers that Culver murdered his father. A desperate Julia and Cutler are trying to get across the border. Carl ultimately decides to let them go, believing they deserve each other.
