Jo is a taxi driver in Chinatown, San Francisco who, along with his nephew Steve, are seeking to purchase a cab license of their own. Jos friend Chan Hung was the go-between to finalize the transaction but at the beginning of the film, Chan has disappeared, taking Jos money with him. The two men begin their search for Chan by speaking with a series of Chinatown locals, each of whom has a different impression of Chans personality and motivations. The portrait that is created is incomplete and, at times, contradictory. As the mystery behind Chans disappearance deepens, Jo becomes paranoid that Chan may be involved in the death of man killed during a "flag-waving incident" between opposing supporters of the Peoples Republic of China (mainland China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan). In the end, Chan remains missing but through his daughter, he returns Jo and Steves money. Jo, holding a photo of Chan where his face is completely obscured, eventually accepts that Chan is an enigma, saying in a voiceover, "heres a picture of Chan Hung but I still cant see him."
