A successful Los Angeles-based businessperson, doting father of two and a loving husband, Ron Lewis (John Daniels) turns into a completely different self at night â€“ his alter ego, the "Black Baron", a prominent, powerful and feared pimp; but after killing two racist police officers in his pursuit, the Baron realises that his pimping days are numbered.
