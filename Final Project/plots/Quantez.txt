Hellers (John Larch) gang of outlaws pull a robbery, kill a man and ride toward Mexico, fleeing a posse. To spend the night, they first head for the border town of Quantez, but are shocked to discover that it has become a ghost town, with no one else there. Gentry (Fred MacMurray), the gangs most experienced man, finds liquor in the saloon, while Teach (John Gavin), a younger gunslinger, becomes interested in Chaney (Dorothy Malone), who is Hellers woman but upset over the murder during the holdup. Gato, who was raised by Apaches, is infuriated by Hellers referring to him as "breed" and making him proceed on foot after a horse collapses from exhaustion. Gato (Sydney Chaplin) discovers a warning from Apaches to anyone who comes to town. He seeks out Delgadito (Michael Ansara), the tribes leader, and proposes they kill the whites and divide the loot. Heller, meantime, is trying to get his partners to do the same, kill the others so theres more money to split among whos left. Gentry and Teach both have feelings for Chaney, who wants to leave town as soon as possible. A wandering minstrel comes to town, calling himself Puritan (James Barton), and while he paints Hellers portrait, he sings a song about John Coventry, a legendary outlaw in these parts. Puritan is suddenly astonished when he spots Gentry and realizes that he is Coventry. The veteran gunman is trying to put his violent life behind him for good. In a final gunfight, Gato is killed by Delgalito after a betrayal. Heller is killed by Gentry, and with arrows raining down, Gentry sacrifices himself, providing cover while Chaney and Teach make their getaway.
