Charlie works on a farm from 4am to late at night. He gets his food on the run (milking a cow into his coffee, holding an chicken over the frying pan to get fried eggs). His love interest in the village is the girl played by Edna Purviance. He loves her, but is disliked by her father. He rides a cow into a stream and is kicked off. Unconscious, he dreams of a nymph dance. Back in reality a city slicker is hurt in a car crash and is being cared for by Edna. He appears to have an eye for Edna too. Chaplin tries to win her back. When Charlie is rejected after attempting to imitate the slicker, the result is ambiguousâ€”either tragic or a happy ending. Critics have long argued as to whether the final scene is real or a dream.
