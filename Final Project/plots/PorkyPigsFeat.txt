The cartoon centers around Porky Pig and Daffy Ducks attempts to escape the Broken Arms Hotel manager without paying their bill (on which they are charged for every luxury, including breathing air, sunshine, and goodwill); the reason for trying to evade the payment is due to Daffy losing all their money playing craps. Despite numerous methods to elude the hotel manager (from using the elevator, sending the manager down a large spiral staircase, or going out of the window), he eventually gets the upper hand and locks them up in Porky and Daffys hotel room until they pay up. Winter approaches, and Daffy is beginning to lose his sanity. Porky (after writing "Porky Loves Petunia" amidst the graffiti on the wall) wishes Bugs Bunny was with them. Daffy concurs and decides to call Bugs for advice, as the trickster is famous for being able to get out of seemingly inescapable situations. While on the phone, Bugs asks Daffy if hes tried various methods of escape, to which Daffy replies that he has. ("Yes, we tried all those ways.") The door to the next room opens up and Bugs is seen in shackles. He says, "Ahh, dont work, do they?" The cartoon irises out, with the "Porky drum" ending.
