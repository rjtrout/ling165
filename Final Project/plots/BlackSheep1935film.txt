Aboard a luxury liner, gambler John Francis Dugan makes the acquaintance of socialite Jeanette Foster, who has a reputation for using men to get her way. Jeanette cajoles him into sneaking her into First Class, where they see young Fred Curtis lose $12,000 at poker to a couple of oilmen, Belcher and Schmelling. Freds troubles grow worse when the haughty Millicent Bath has his markers and threatens to tell the police unless he helps her at Customs, sneaking some valuable pearls into the country that she ha stolen. Fred is so forlorn that he considers jumping overboard, until Jeanette stops him. Dugan decides to help. He wins back Freds debts at cards. When they return to Freds stateroom, Dugan spots a photo of Freds deceased mother and is shocked to discover that she was his ex-wife. Fred is his long-lost son. Mrs. Bath has hidden the pearls inside a canes handle. Dugan distracts her, replaces the pearls with pills, then hides the valuables inside the pocket of Belcher, the oilman. They spill out at Customs and are claimed by Mrs. Bath to belong to her, causing her to be taken away by the authorities. Dugan has become fond of Jeannette, who promises to change her old ways.
