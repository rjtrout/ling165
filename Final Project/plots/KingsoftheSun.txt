Balam (George Chakiris) is the son of the ruler of a Mayan tribe who use wooden swords (with obsidian edges). His father is killed in battle against metal-blade armed rivals led by Hunac Ceel (Leo Gordon). Balam succeeds to the throne, but is convinced by his advisers, including the head priest, to lead his followers away from the Yucat√°n, sail to the American Gulf Coast region, so they might regain their strength and fight again another day. Balams party comes to a coastal settlement with many boats. Balam wants the population of the settlement to join him with their boats. The settlements chief agrees if Balam agrees to marry his daughter, Ixchel (Shirley Anne Field), and make her Queen. Balam agrees. The new land they arrive in is a province occupied by a Native American tribe led by Black Eagle (Yul Brynner). They are none too pleased about these strange, uninvited immigrants. In a small raid to capture one of the Mayans, Black Eagle is wounded and taken captive to the Mayans fortified settlement. Balams love interest Ixchel tends to the Indians wounds and gains an interested suitor, one who is more forthcoming with his love for her. Balam is under pressure to resume their custom of human sacrifice by sacrificing Black Eagle. Balam has always been against the policy of human sacrifice and sets Black Eagle free. Eventually, the two leaders agree to coexist in peace. However, they quarrel, and the Native Americans depart, just as Hunac Ceel finds Balam and his people. Hunac Ceels army mounts a furious attack, but is eventually defeated by the united front of Indians and the transplanted Mayans. Black Eagle is killed in the fighting, resolving the love triangle.
