Maddie Wirtz is a high school senior living in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. Her plans to coast through her last school year before college are waylaid when she meets another teenage girl whos a drifter, "Legs," who takes shelter from the rain inside her school. The same day she meets them, Legs convinces Maddie and fellow students Rita Faldes and Violet Kahn to confront Mr. Buttinger, a teacher whos been sexually harassing Rita and Violet. Maddie, Rita, and Violet flee after the confrontation turns violent, witnessed by student Goldie Goldman, who flees with them. Later, Legs finds Maddie at her house from the address in a notebook Maddie dropped in Mr. Buttingers classroom. Legs spends the night at Maddies house and bonds with her further in the morning before school. Maddie finds out at school that she, Rita, Violet, and Goldie are being suspended for the confrontation of Mr. Buttinger, despite their explanation of what happened. After getting kicked out of school, the girls go to an abandoned house where Maddie suggested Legs stay, finding Legs there. All five girls quickly form a close bond, with the abandoned house as their "headquarters" and engaging in further acts of rebellion, such as breaking into the school to retrieve part of Maddies art school application (which the principal refused to let her get before she got kicked out) and Legs tattooing a flame on all of them. Legs and Maddie also learn that Goldies father physically abuses her. Everything culminates when the girls crash a car stolen from a group of boys who were about to rape Maddie. Though not seriously injured, the girls go on trial for stealing the car, with the boys and one of their girlfriends, Cindy, lying about the events leading up to it. Legs is sent to a juvenile prison and the group flounders without her, with Goldie starting to use heroin. Eventually, Cindy, feeling guilty, tells the judge the truth, leading to Legs release. The girls reunion is tempered by Legs learning of Goldies addiction; Maddie has taken to the abandoned house to detox. In an effort to help her, Legs leads Maddie, Rita, and Violet to Goldies house to demand $10,000 from her parents to send Goldie to rehab. The situation escalates when Goldies father refuses and Legs, holding him at gunpoint, forces the others to take him to the abandoned house. He is tied to a chair while the girls try to think of what to do next, and the tension rises as Legs begins taking her own paternal frustrations out on him. Throughout the chaos, Rita, who was told to hold the gun on Goldies father, accidentally shoots him in the shoulder. Panic ensues and the girls resolve to get Goldies father to the hospital. When Goldie, Rita, and Violet leave with Goldies father, Maddie realizes Legs is missing. She finds Legs walking along the bridge, looking for a ride to another town. Both girls make proposals, Maddie for Legs to stay with her and the others and Legs for Maddie to join her on the road. Sad but resolute, the two eventually go their separate ways. Legs gets a truck to stop and boards as Maddie watches it disappear. In a voice-over, its revealed that Maddie finishes high school and goes on to art school. She travels the world, always stopping at airports and bus stops along the way. Although none of the group ever see Legs again, they still get together once in a while and strengthen their bond over the past.
