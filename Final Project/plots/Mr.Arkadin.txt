Guy Van Stratten (played by Robert Arden), a small-time American smuggler working in Europe, is at the scene of the murder of a man named Bracco. The dying man whispers two names that he claims are very valuable, one of which is Gregory Arkadin. Using this small bit of information and lots of bluffing, Van Stratten manages to meet multi-millionaire business magnate and socialite Arkadin, who then hires Van Stratten to research his own past, of which Arkadin claims to have no memory before 1927. Traveling across the world, Van Stratten pieces together Arkadins past from the few remaining people who knew him as a gangster in Europe after World War I, but in each case, the individuals Van Stratten speaks to end up dead. When he ultimately discovers the truth about Arkadins past, there is a climactic race to Spain between the two, with disastrous consequences.
