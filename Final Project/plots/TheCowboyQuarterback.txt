Rusty Walker, a scout for the Chicago Packers professional football team, discovers a young fellow named Harry Lynn in remote Montana who has amazing prowess as a quarterback. He persuades Harry to come to Chicago, but because Harry is afraid to leave girlfriend Maizie alone with rival suitor "Handsome Sam" Saxon, he insists that Maizie be permitted to come along. Harrys play is as good as Rusty expects it to be, but Maizie is a constant distraction. When she leaves town, team management fixes up Harry with the attractive Evelyn Corey and, sure enough, he falls in love. Harry writes a letter to Maizie, breaking off their engagement, then has second thoughts, but teammate Steve mails it without Harrys knowledge. Getting drunk, Harry loses $5,000 gambling while unaware he was betting real money. Crooks instruct him to throw the Packers big game against the Ramblers, and things get further complicated when Harry learns that Evelyn actually intends to marry Rusty, not him. Maizie returns with Handsome Sam, and after leading the team to victory in the final seconds, Harry manages to intercept Handsome Sam as hes about to hand Maizie the unopened letter.
