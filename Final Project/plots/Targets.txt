Byron Orlok (Boris Karloff), an aging, embittered horror movie actor, abruptly announces his decision to retire and return to his native England to live out his final days. Orlok considers himself outdated because he believes that people are no longer frightened by old-fashioned horror, citing real-life news stories as more horrifying than anything in his films. But after much persuasion, particularly from young director Sammy Michaels (Peter Bogdanovich), Orlok agrees to make a final in-person promotional appearance at a Reseda drive-in theater before leaving Hollywood for good. Bobby Thompson (Tim OKelly) is a young, quiet, clean-cut insurance agent and Vietnam War veteran who lives in the suburban San Fernando Valley area with his wife and his parents. Thompson is also deeply disturbed and an obsessive gun collector, but his family takes little notice. One morning, after his father leaves for work, Thompson murders his wife, his mother, and a delivery boy at his home. That afternoon, Thompson continues the killing spree, shooting people in passing cars from atop an oil storage tank that sits alongside a heavily traveled freeway. When the police respond and start to close in on Thompson, he flees, taking refuge in the very same drive-in theater where Orlok is to make his appearance that evening. After sunset, Thompson kills the theaters projectionist and perches himself on the framing inside the screen tower. While the Orlok film is shown, he begins shooting at the patrons around the lot. After Thompson wounds Orloks secretary, Jenny, Orlok confronts Thompson, who is distracted by Orloks simultaneous appearance before him and on the large movie screen behind him, allowing the actor to disarm Thompson using his walking cane. As the defeated Thompson shrinks into a corner, Orlok remarks, "Is that what I was afraid of?" Thompson is then arrested by the police; as he is taken away, he remarks with apparent satisfaction that he "hardly ever missed."
