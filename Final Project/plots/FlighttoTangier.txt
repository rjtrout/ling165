Aboard a private plane, pilot Hank Brady pulls a gun on his lone passenger, Franz Kovaz, after putting the instruments on automatic pilot. Watching from the Tangier airport is another American pilot, Gil Walker, alongside his French girlfriend Nicki, a woman named Susan Lane and a police lieutenant, Luzon, as the plane goes down in flames. The eyewitnesses are taken in to Luzons superior, Col. Wier, for questioning. It is revealed that Gil had known Hank during the war and Susan was an acquaintance of his. Suspicious characters follow them, led by a man named Danzer, who forces his way into their car. It turns out Kovaz was carrying forged documents worth a great deal of money. Gil, Susan and Nicki are held by Danzers men, but they are rescued by the police, led by Luzon, although he is shot and killed. Gil ends up on the run, not sure whom to trust. The plot thickens when both Hank and Kovaz turn up, having parachuted to safety from the plane. In a final confrontation, Hank is killed, and he and Susan are both revealed to be government agents, working undercover. Gil is free to go, and Susan goes along.
