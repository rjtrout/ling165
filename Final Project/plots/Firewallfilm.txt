Jack Stanfield is chief of security of Landrock Pacific Bank in downtown Seattle. He is visited by a collection agency, claiming he owes $95,000 ($115,000 today) to their online gambling site. Believing the incident is due to an identity theft, Jack entrusts a colleague to take care of the claim. He goes out for a drink with Harry Romano who introduces him to Bill Cox, a potential partner. After they leave, Cox follows Jack into his car and forces him to drive home at gunpoint. At home, Jack finds his wife Beth and two children unharmed, but under surveillance by Coxs henchmen. The next morning, Jack is given instruction to transfer $10,000 each from the banks 10,000 largest depositors – $100 million total ($120 million today) – to Coxs bank account. Cox rigs Jack with a camera and microphone to make sure he cannot ask for help without them knowing. At Landrock Bank, Cox visits Jack, reintroducing himself as Bill Redmond, a potential partner. Cox asks Jack to give him a tour of the banks security system. On the way back home, Jack attempts to bribe a henchman to betray Cox, but Cox kills the henchman. At home, Jack attempts an escape with his family, but his attempt is foiled. In retaliation, Cox gives Jacks son Andy a cookie containing nut products, sending him into an anaphylactic shock. Cox withholds the treatment (an EpiPen), until Jack acquiesces to their plan. The next day, Cox forces Jack to fire his secretary Janet, fearing that she is growing suspicious. Jack initiates a wire transfer to send the money to Coxs offshore accounts. Before leaving, Jack uses an employees camera phone to take a picture of the account information on the screen. Cox then begins wiping his tracks. He forces Jack to delete security data and surveillance tapes, and use a virus to cripple the buildings system into disarray. Returning home, Jack finds the house empty except for Liam, one of Coxs men. Realizing Cox has no intention of letting him live, Jack kills Liam. He tries to call Harry, but his colleague doesnt answer. Jack goes to Harrys house to inquire about Cox. However, Cox kills Harry with the gun he had earlier confiscated from Jack. Beth, held at gunpoint, leaves a message suggesting an affair on Harrys answering machine. This implicates Jack in Harrys death. In addition, the false $95,000 debts will be considered motive for Jack embezzling the banks money. Jack turns to the only ally he has left: his secretary Janet. She helps him retrieve the phone with the picture of Coxs account information. Jack calls Cox and announces a change of plans. Jack has hacked into his Cayman Island accounts and threatens to transfer the money away, unless Cox frees his family. During the conversation, Jack hears the family dog in the background, and realizes he can locate his family by the GPS tracking unit in the dogs collar. The signal leads him to an abandoned house. He tells Janet to call the police and approaches the house. When one of his henchmen takes pity on the family, Cox kills him. Jacks daughter Sarah runs out of the house. Another henchman chases after her, but Jack runs him over with Janets car. Cox, seeing that the tide has turned, panics and takes Beth and Andy to the upper floor. Jack enters the house and after a confrontation, he manages to kill Cox with a pickaxe, saving his family.
