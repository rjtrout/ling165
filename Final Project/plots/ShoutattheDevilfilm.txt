Colonel Flynn OFlynn (Lee Marvin), a hard-drinking American, manipulates British aristocrat Sebastian Oldsmith (Roger Moore) into helping poach ivory in Tanganyika, which is part of the German-controlled pre-World War I territory of German East Africa. On hearing news that the American has returned, Herman Fleischer, the local German Commander of the Southern Provinces, relentlessly hunts OFlynn with his Schutztruppen (colonial troops). Later Sebastian meets and falls in love with OFlynns daughter, Rosa (Barbara Parkins). They are married and have a daughter together. Meanwhile the poaching continues. Fleischer has his warship ram and sink OFlynns Arab dhow (ship) loaded with poached ivory. Later, while attacking OFlynns home, Schutztruppe under Fleischers command kill Sebastians daughter Maria. OFlynn and Sebastian decide to go and kill Fleischer as revenge for the death of the little girl. But when it is discovered that Britain is at war with Germany, allied officers convince OFlynn to locate and destroy the German warship awaiting repair. OFlynn, Sebastian, and Rosa pursue Fleischer, who happens to be on the warship. Eventually they find her in an inlet and plant a bomb on board. OFlynn sacrifices himself so that Sebastian and Rosa can escape while Fleischers crew search for the bomb. Fleischer jumps overboard just in time to get away also, but as he comes ashore, Sebastian dispatches him with a rifle. Sebastian and Rosa then watch the ship as it is ripped apart by more explosions and burns.
