In 1881, a quartet of bandits have their eye or robbing the bank of Cholla. Though several attempts have ended disastrously for the bank robbers, Cully, the leader, has a plan. On their way they meet Simon Bhumer and Lolly, his daughter. Dutch, one of Cullys gang, was a former friend of Simon when both were gunfighters until Simon gave up gunslinging to settle down and raise a family, though his wife was later killed in an Indian attack. The gang meets up again with Simon and Lolly at their friend Greasys general store and see signs of Apache activity leading to war. Cully and Lolly hate each other at first, but each senses something good in the other. They separate after the bank robbery. Simon and Lolly ride to their new farm at Shadow Valley. Cullys plan is to ride into his former town of Cholla, where he was expelled by rival Jim Flannery, now the town sheriff. As all the men in town watch Cully and Jim beat the living daylights out of each other, the others rob the bank without incident or witnesses. Heading for the Mexican border, the gang sees that the Apaches are on the warpath. Cully has to choose between being safe and rich in Mexico or rescuing Simon and Lolly from an Apache war party.
