Aspiring ballerina Meg Merlin idolizes the head of her dance school, Ariane Bouchet, so much so that she often neglects her own studies just to watch Ariane dance. Only the intervention of kindly Mr. Paternos keeps her from being expelled. When she hears that the "first lady of ballet," Lady Anna La Darina, is coming to the school, Meg is livid at Ariane being upstaged. She sets out to sabotage Annas stay, beginning with mischief like turning off the lights in the middle of a session. Meg is so obsessed in her quest, she even strikes dance student Phyllis Brigham when she dares prefer Annas talent to Arianes, earning a formal reprimand. During a performance of "Swan Lake," intending to switch off the lights again, Meg accidentally pulls the lever instead on a trap door. Anna plummets and seriously injures her spine. Phyllis and friend Josie have a hunch whos responsible, so Meg is blackmailed by them. Worse yet, she discovers that Ariane is actually arrogantly self-involved, whereas Anna is generous and kind, coming back to the school to advise the students as best she can. When she learns the truth, Anna even forgives Meg, who now has a new idol.
