Mama Teresa runs a small New York cafe. She keeps son Joe Lorenzo out of reform school and adopts his hopeless, homeless pal Nick, hoping theyll stay out of trouble. Joes life of crime pays for Nicks education. He pretends to be out west running a ranch, but Joe is actually doing time in San Quintin prison for his crimes. He gets out and returns to New York with his girl, Laurie Romayne, a convicted forger, to see Nick graduate from college. Laurie is drawn to Mamas wholesome way of life and also falls for Nick, so Joe threatens to reveal her past. Joe also informs on criminals Scarfi and Turner, who had framed him into landing behind bars. Turner wants revenge after Scarfi is executed, but Joe is able to elude him. His guilty conscience allows Laurie to pursue a relationship with Nick.
