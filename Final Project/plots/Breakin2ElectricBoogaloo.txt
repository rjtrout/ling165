Breakin 2 features three characters from Breakin – Kelly (Lucinda Dickey), David "Ozone" Barco (Adolfo Quinones), and Jason "Turbo" Ainley (Michael Chambers) – who struggle to stop the demolition of a community recreation center by a developer who wants to build a shopping mall. Viktor Manoel, Ice-T, and Martika (who was little known then) also appear as dancers.
