Los Angeles Dr. Henry Pride (Bernie Casey) is an accomplished, wealthy, African American medical doctor working on a cure for cirrhosis of the liver along with his colleague, Dr. Billie Worth (Rosalind Cash). Desperate to create this remedy, Pride conducts unethical experiments on others and himself, which turns Pride into a white, Frankenstein-like monster with superhuman strength and invincibility as he begins to rampage throughout Watts killing prostitutes and pimps. After not being able to test his remedy on Linda (Marie OHenry), Pride goes into a rampage which results in him being chased down by the police. Cornered at Watts Towers, Pride attempts to escape by climbing up the towers, which leads to the police gunning him down as he falls to his death. According to Frederick Douglass in the Atlanta Daily World, the film was "for escapism and fun" as "everything is taken in an extreme and comes off as being comical rather than serious."
