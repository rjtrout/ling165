Ellen Beldon is about to be hanged in Texas for the cold-blooded murder of her husband. Her ranch foreman, Judd Farrow, busts her out of jail and escorts Ellen to a safe hideout in New Mexico. Her father-in-law, Mace Beldon, determined to avenge the killing of his son, hires gunman Gil McCord for $5,000 to track down Ellen and do away with her. Ellen explains to Gil what really happened, that her husband was murdered by another son, Kel Beldon, who wants to be sole heir to their fathers money and land. Kel comes after Ellen, but is killed in a shootout with Gil.
