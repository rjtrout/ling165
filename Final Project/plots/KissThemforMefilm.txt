Three decorated Navy pilots finagle a four-day leave in San Francisco. They land a posh suite at The Fairmont San Francisco Hotel where Commander Andy Crewson (Cary Grant), a master of procurement, arranges to populate it with wine, women and song. Blonde bombshell Alice Kratzner (Jayne Mansfield) is one of these women, lured to the suite under the false pretense that Crewson has a stash of nylon stockings. Once there, she is naturally attracted to Crewson, but later turns her attention to Lieutenant McCann (Ray Walston), a married man who also is in the process of running for a Congressional seat back home in Massachusetts. If he is elected, McCann can leave the Navy immediately and return to civilian life. Lieutenant Wallace (Werner Klemperer) tries to get the three pilots, including "Mississip" (Larry Blyden), to make morale-raising speeches at the plants of shipyard magnate Eddie Turnbill (Leif Erickson), so that Turnbill will vouch for the men with the Navy and also to grease a lucrative job for himself upon leaving the service. Crewson and his cohorts, however, are physically and mentally exhausted from the war and simply want to enjoy a few days away from it. Suffering from combat stress and confronted with a number of reminders of the horrors of war, Crewson tries to amuse himself by making a play for Turnbills attractive fianc√©e, Gwinneth Livingston (Suzy Parker). She resists his advances at first, but ultimately throws her engagement ring in Turnbills face. Crewson declares his love for her shortly before he and his mates board a plane leaving San Francisco to return to duty.
