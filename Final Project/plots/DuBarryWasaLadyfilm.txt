The entertainer May Dalys nightclub act includes her portrayal of Madame Du Barry of days of yore. Equally smitten with her are coatroom attendant Louis Blore and master of ceremonies Alec Howe, but unfortunately for both, May persists in holding out for a wealthy husband, her current interest being a rich but snooty gent, Willie. A telegram arrives notifying Louis that in the Irish Sweepstakes he is the winner of a prize of $150,000. Louis immediately and publicly declares his love for May, who is teased by Alec that she now has no reason to stay with Willie and avoid Louis, who is a sweeter fellow. Then after accidentally swallowing a drugged drink, Louis falls into a deep sleep and dreams that he is King Louis XV, holding court with Madame Du Barry (May) and holding off her colorful suitor, The Black Arrow (Alec). After swordplay and the sentencing of the Black Arrow to the guillotine, Louis awakens from his dream. He realizes that May is in love with Alec and generously offers them a wedding gift of $10,000. May declines, saying she has changed her mind about moneys importance. Everybody ends up happy until a tax collector comes to demand that Louis pay him $80,000.
