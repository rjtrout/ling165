American millionaire Frederick Harmon (played by Lionel Barrymore) is in Paris, France, for business and pleasure. While enjoying the Parisian night life, he meets and falls in love with Ginette (played by Hope Hampton), a fashion model who moonlights as an apache dancer in a nightclub. They marry and he returns to New York with her. When Harmon meets the urbane divorcee Nina Olmstead (played by Louise Glaum) he becomes involved in an affair. Ginette discovers her husbands infidelity and decides to win him back by going out with an old boyfriend, Jean (played by Jean Del Val), a member of the Paris underworld. Nina schemes to end the marriage of the Harmons using the seeming romance between Ginette and Jean. Harmon learns of Ninas treachery and her attempt to estrange the couple fails. He realizes that Ginette was merely trying to make him jealous and that he completely trusts her loyalty to him. They are happily reconciled.
