Scotland, 1751: At a stately manor near Edinburgh, the young David Balfour arrives with a sealed letter from his recently deceased father for Ebenezer, his uncle. It is meant to be delivered to a family lawyer to introduce David as the rightful heir to the property. After slyly trying to kill his previously unknown nephew but failing, Ebenezer conspires with a sea captain, Hoseason, to take the boy hostage and sell him into slavery. A prisoner aboard ship, David soon meets Alan Breck, who, in need of rescue, now finds himself in danger of Hoseason stealing his gold and perhaps murdering him as well. Davids quick intervention saves his life. Washed up ashore after a storm, David is hidden by an innkeepers daughter, Aileen, then begins a long and arduous journey home. With the help of Alan, he is able to coerce a confession about the kidnapping from his uncle that is overheard by the lawyer, who now knows David to be the proper heir. Hoseason, feeling betrayed, tries to kill Ebenezer in a sword fight, resulting in the deaths of both.
