Rachel Foster (Linda Haynes) is a country singer travelling alone through the United States. She resists the advances of lecherous bar owner Mat Tibbs (Aldo Ray) and in her hurry to leave town, she accidentally wrecks her car. Looking for assistance, she finds what appears to be an abandoned house - but after stumbling inside the place, unbeknownst to her, she discovers that in fact its instead actually the scene of a grisly multiple homicide perpetrated by a young boy. Simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time, shes railroaded into a womens correctional facility by the prurient bar owners brother Sheriff Tibbs (Jackie Coogan) as well as falsely charged with the murders, the innocent musician finds herself at the mercy of prison psychiatrist Doctor Kline (Geoffrey Lewis) who has insidious intentions up his sleeve. Evidently it doesnt take Rachel long to realize that something is greatly amiss, as well as that the prison is also hiding a dark secret from the public eye when some female inmates inexplicably go missing without a trace. Kline has some radical techniques for "curing" criminality, and after a failed escape attempt she undergoes his treatment and completely loses her mind.
