Newspaper reporter "Scoops" (Brown) is sent out on assignment, to investigate the failed assassination attempts on Archduke Julio (Harry Davenport). Trying to get the story, he runs into Jane Hamilton (Helen Mack) who is really Princess Helen. He doesnt realize that she is the story: a princess in exile, in danger of assassination; and, falling in love with "Scoops", while engaged to a prince. The film ends with a wild chase and a shootout with machine guns. The question is, who will survive to tell the tale?
