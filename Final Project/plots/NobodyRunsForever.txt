New South Wales Police Sergeant Scobie Malone (Taylor) is summoned to Sydney by the Premier of New South Wales (Leo McKern) who at the time was the controversial Sir Robert Askin. The Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir James Quentin (Plummer) is wanted for a 25-year-old murder charge, that the Premier, Quentins gruff political rival, has discovered. Upon arrival in London, Malone meets Lady Quentin (Lilli Palmer) and her husband, the sophisticated Sir James, as well as Sir Jamess secretary (Camilla Sparv). Sir James offers no objection to the murder charges but demands several days before departure as he is conducting delicate peace negotiations. As Malone waits as a guest of the High Commissioner, he prevents assassination attempts against Quentin by a dangerous spy ring headed by Maria Cholon (Daliah Lavi).
