Tom Herrera (Robert Horton) the head of a stagecoach station in New Mexico prepares to defend against an attack by an Apache party, seeking revenge for the killing of several Indians by an outlaw. When a stagecoach arrives at the station with passengers Nancy Dekker (Barbara Ruick) Cyril R. Snowden (Gene Lockhart) Lorraine Sayburn and Fanny Webson (Glenda Farrell) they are stranded at the station with Tom and his outlaw father Peso Herrera (Gilbert Roland). Peso is the most wanted outlaw in the country and is after the gold contained in the casket of the stagecoach. Tom knowing about his fathers intention takes his guns away as a precaution. As the Apaches begin their attack, suspicion is immediately cast on Peso as the reason for the Apaches attack. Tom and Fanny defend Peso when others in the station suggest Peso be turned over to the Indians to end the conflict quickly. Tom eventually wins the argument and Peso stays in the station. However, with the help of Fanny, who gives her guns to Peso, he holds up Tom and the others and demands that they hand over the gold. Tom shoots the gun out of his fathers hand. Despite the robbery attempt Tom continues to believe that his father is not responsible for the Indians attack. A fierce battle begins with the Indians and those trapped inside the station. During the fighting, a Indians emissary tries to negotiate the surrender of the murderer, but Tom again refuses to turn his father over and the fighting resumes. During the battle, Peso knocks out Pike Curtis (Myron Healey) who Peso knows is the killer and turns him over to the Indians. With all doubt about his father removed Tom joins Fanny on her journey to San Francisco. Later, Nancy informs Tom that the gold is not as safe as he thinks because the young boy assigned to guard the gold is actually another one of Pesos sons.
