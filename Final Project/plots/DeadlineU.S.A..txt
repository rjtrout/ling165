Ed Hutcheson is the crusading managing editor of a large metropolitan newspaper called The Day. He is steadfastly loyal to publisher Margaret Garrison, the widow of the papers founder, but Mrs. Garrison is on the verge of selling the newspaper to interests who plan to permanently cease its operation. Hutcheson has other concerns, including that his estranged wife Nora is about to remarry. He also puts his reporters to work on the murder of a young woman and the involvement of racketeer Tomas Rienzi, which could turn out to be a circulation builder that keeps the paper in business or else the last big story it ever covers. Reporters discover that the dead girl, Bessie Schmidt, had been Rienzis mistress, and that her brother Herman had illegal business dealings with the gangster. Hutcheson gets to Herman with an opportunity to safely tell his story, but Rienzis thugs, disguised as cops, take him away, resulting in Hermans death. All seems lost when Mrs. Garrisons daughters, majority stockholders Kitty and Alice, refuse to budge, causing a judge to permit The Day to be sold. Bessies elderly mother, Mrs. Schmidt, turns up in Hutchesons office with her daughters diary, implicating Rienzi in his illegal activities. The presses roll as Hutcheson ignores the gangsters threats.
