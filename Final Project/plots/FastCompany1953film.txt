Carol Maldon leaves New York to run her recently deceased fathers stable. Rick Grayton is the trainer and jockey of her horse Gay Fleet. It is an exceptional horse, but no one yet knows Gay Fleet because it is still young. Rick has been intentionally losing races to make the horse seem inferior so that he can buy it from Carol cheaply. However, he is discovered by Mercedes, a rival stable owner, who tells Ricks plan to Carol.
