Miriam Wilkins (Mona Freeman) is as usual trying to help more than her family can bear. She has founded an association for rehabilitation of former prisoners. Her father is honorary president without knowing it. As one convicted, Mr. Baxter, is set free on parole she sees the opportunity for her association to get in action. She hires Baxter as gardener letting him live in their house (over the garage). As it turns out his conviction had been imposed by Judge Wilkins, now senator, the situation in the house gets a bit chaotic.
