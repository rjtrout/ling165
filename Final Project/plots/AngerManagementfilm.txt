In 1978, a young Dave Buznik is about to kiss the girl of his dreams, when a local bully, Arnie Shankman, pulls down his pants and underwear, embarrassing him in front of everybody. This leaves Dave with lasting trauma about public affection, as well as repressing his emotions. Twenty five years later, Dave Buznik lives in New York City, working as an associate for Frank Head, an abusive boss who takes credit for Daves work. His problems also extend to his private life; his girlfriend Lindas ex-boyfriend Andrew is still close friends with her and is condescending to Dave at work. While flying to a business meeting, a series of annoyances from a flight attendant and a sky marshal cause Dave to lose his temper. The sky marshal, who also mistakes Dave for a racist, tasers him. Dave is then arrested for assaulting the flight attendant and sentenced to anger management therapy. The therapist is Buddy Rydell, who is revealed to be the man Dave sat next to on the plane. Buddys unorthodox techniques cause Dave to lose his temper, and Buddy tells Dave he recognizes his problem as passive-aggressive anger. When Dave is sent back to court, Buddy intervenes on his behalf choosing to move in with Dave and shadow him in his life as part of more intensive therapy. Failure to comply will result in a year of jail time for Dave. Although Dave believes Andrew is doing nothing to ruin him at work, Buddy suspects otherwise and tells him that he needs to start fighting back or nothing will change. After receiving a phone call for Buddy informing him his mother is undergoing minor surgery, Dave jokes to him about its seriousness, prompting Buddy to warn hell get Dave back. After seeing Buddys mother, the two stop at a restaurant on the way back to New York. After Buddy pressures him, Dave flirts and goes home with a young lady, but rejects her amorous advances out of loyalty to Linda. Later, Dave is devastated to learn that Buddy has told Linda about the woman, but Buddy explains the woman was a former patient of his, having set up the encounter to get revenge on Dave for the "dying mother" prank. The next morning, Buddy apologizes to Dave and says he explained everything to Linda, followed by him taking a detour to a Buddhist temple, so that Dave can confront a reformed Arnie, who has become a monk. While confronting his tormentor, Arnie expresses his sincerest apologies to Dave for bullying him, but he laughs when Dave reminds him of the kiss incident. Buddy and an initially hesitant Dave provoke Arnie by lying about Dave molesting Arnies mentally ill sister, and Dave and Arnie fight. Buddy teases the monks into a rage and the two are chased off the grounds, with Dave feeling good on confronting his tormentor. Back in New York, Dave attempts to propose to Linda but loses his nerve, and Linda suggests that they take a break from their relationship. Soon after Buddy begins dating Linda, Dave sees this as the last straw and loses his cool by attacking Buddy. Being called back into court, Dave is given a restraining order by the judge, who threatens to lock him up if Dave has another incident. Called into work and yelled at by his boss, Dave finally snaps when he learns that his boss intentionally passed him up and gave the promotion to Andrew.  Dave calls Andrew out for trying to interfere with both his promotion and relationship with Linda, revealing he wants Andrew out of their lives forever. Andrew attempts to insult him but taking Buddys advice, Dave knocks him out cold. He proceeds to humiliate his boss by using a golf club to wreck his office and reminding him of all the years of his loyal services just to be denied of the promotion he wanted so much. Dave then tells his boss that if he gets out of jail within the next two to five years, he expects his boss to do the right thing and give him the promotion that Andrew presumably resigned from. His boss agrees and Dave deliberately steps on Andrews head as he leaves. Learning from Andrew that Buddy has taken Linda to a New York Yankees game, Dave assumes Buddy intends to steal his proposal idea and races to the stadium. Security captures him and begins to remove him from the stadium but Mayor Rudy Giuliani orders them to allow Dave to speak. After admitting that he does have an anger problem and is willing to change, Dave agrees to kiss Linda in front of the stadium in exchange for her marrying him. Linda and Buddy then reveal that the game was the final part of Daves therapy, and explain that the tormentors and aggravations he has been put through were Buddys doing to teach him how to unleash his anger in healthy doses to avoid it building up. The passenger, the Judge, the waitress, and the flight attendant are all Buddys friends, while the sky marshal who tased him was just having a bad day. The three attend a picnic with Buddys other patients, where Dave plays a final joke on Buddy with a friend holding the group up with a  water pistol, and the film ends as the friends sing "I Feel Pretty" from West Side Story together.
