Mary Ann "Pookie" Adams is an oddball, quirky teenager who meets the quiet, reserved Jerry Payne while waiting for a bus heading to their colleges. Their colleges are near each other, and they have each enrolled as freshmen. Jerry immediately sees that Pookie is different, even strange. She lies to a nun on the bus so the nun will switch seats with her. Jerry is beginning to settle into college life with his roommate, Charlie Schumacher, when the aggressive Pookie arrives unannounced one Saturday morning. Pookie and Jerry spend much time together over the weekend, and soon begin to see each other regularly. Jerry falls in love with Pookie, but their different personalities starts to pull them apart. After having sex, Pookie tells Jerry she might be pregnant. After the pregnancy scare is over, Jerry wants to spend spring break alone to catch up on his studies. Pookie pleads to stay with him, and he relents. A week alone with the needy and somewhat unstable Pookie makes Jerry realize that they need time apart. Discovering later that she has dropped out of her college, Jerry finds her in the same boarding house where she had stayed on the first day she came to visit. He puts her on a bus for home, and the young lovers part ways.
