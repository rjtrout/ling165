Jack Martin (Danny Kaye) is an American entertainer. He has a skit in his show, making fun of the Captain Henri Duran (also Kaye). On one particular evening, the Captain and his wife, Lili (Gene Tierney) come to see Jacks impersonation. To the surprise of the couple, the act is amazingly realistic. Backstage, the Captain meets Jacks girlfriend, Colette (Corinne Calvet), and invites her to a party he is going to hold. Colette declines. Later in the evening, Jack meets Lili and is attracted to her beauty. He does an impersonation of the Captain for her. But the real Captain receives a telegram that his airline is in danger because a contract is not being renewed and he has already purchased 51% of the stock. He has to leave France. Jack is hired to play the Captain to confuse his rival, Periton (Jean Murat), but at the stock market, he buys the remainder of the airline stock. That evening, at the party, Jack is hired again to play the Captain. He does not want Lili to know, but Lili is informed without his knowing. He sweeps her off her feet and they stay close to each other for the remainder of the evening. Meanwhile, Colette is furious to discover that Jack is at the party and decides to go there as well, where she discovers that he is impersonating the Captain. To make matter worse, the real Captain returns to his house, confusing all involved. Periton corners Jack instead and talks to him in French, which Jack cant understand.
