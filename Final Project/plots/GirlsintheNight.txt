Hannah Haynes, a pretty girl who competes in a beauty contest, dreams of moving away from her New York slum neighborhood. So does older brother Chuck, who has a chance to land a new job on Long Island, but is hit by a car and needs to recover first. Hannah frustrates her boyfriend by going on a date with a hoodlum named Irv Kellener, which causes a fight between the men and makes the evil schemer Vera Schroeder jealous. Chuck and his girlfriend Georgia, who does seductive dances to get men to throw coins her way, become so desperate, they decide to steal from a beggar who is pretending to be blind. Anticipating their plot, Irv gets there first but is caught red-handed by the beggar and shoots him. Vera hides the gun and provides an alibi. Chuck and Georgia later go through with their plan and steal more than $600, unaware that their victim is dead. Vera blackmails them for $2,000 or will snitch to the police. The principals end up confronting one another in a warehouse, where Irv kisses Hannah and infuriates Vera. The police arrive, Irv runs and is accidentally electrocuted. Chuck and Georgia are permitted to go free after returning the stolen money.
