In a hotel lobby a heavily drunk tramp runs into an elegant lady, Mabel, who gets tied up in her dogs leash, and falls down. He later runs into her in the hotel corridor, locked out of her room. They run through various rooms. Mabel ends up in the room of an elderly husband where she hides under the bed. Enter the jealous wife, who soon attacks Mabel, her husband, and Mabels lover, not to mention the staggeringly drunken tramp.
