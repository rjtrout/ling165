Jay Killian (Charles Bronson) is a senior member of the Secret Service. On the day before the Inauguration of the new president, Killian has just returned from a six-month sick leave. He is given a new assignment: to protect the First Lady, Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland). Being highly qualified and a seasoned veteran of the service, Killian is dismayed that he is not on the Presidential detail. To make matters worse, Lara proves to be an extremely difficult charge. She is arrogant, condescending, demanding, and she detests the presence of Killian. With the First Lady doing what she wants and ignoring all of Killians suggestions, it becomes apparent that someone wants Lara dead—especially when a biker tries to shoot her. A wild cross-country adventure ensues as Killian attempts to protect Lara and flush out the assassin and his contractor—and the assassination attempts may have originated from the White House. It turns out that, because of a war injury, the President is impotent and that his wife is about to file in a divorce at the end of his first term. Believing, that the divorce will eliminate the chances of another term, the presidents right-sided supporters staged the assassination attempts, to keep the Presidents impotence a secret and gain him the peoples support in his grief. Killian is able to unravel the conspiracy.
