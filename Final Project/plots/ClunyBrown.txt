A working-class girl (Jennifer Jones) and a Czech refugee (Charles Boyer) meet in England prior to World War II, and Una OConnor, Peter Lawford, Helen Walker, Reginald Gardiner, C. Aubrey Smith, Reginald Owen, and Richard Haydn are around to take up what slack there is. Cluny Brown (Jennifer Jones) is a free spirit, who lives in the moment. She has been told she has to learn her place, and in 1938 England there is much protocol and there are rules to follow. She has a difficult time not being able to be herself, until she meets Adam Belinski (Charles Boyer) who finds her spontaneity intoxicatingly refreshing. A plumbers niece, she has a fascination with plumbing and pipes which get her into trouble, as it is not ladylike, and Uncle decides to send her into domestic service. From there things get even more fun.
