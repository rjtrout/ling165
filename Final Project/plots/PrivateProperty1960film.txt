The film, set in Los Angeles, centers on a pair of drifters, Duke (Allen) and Boots (Oates). As the film begins, they are hanging out at a gasoline station on the Pacific Ocean. They menace the owner and steal from his store. Duke promises Boots that he will fix him up with a woman. They hitch a ride with a motorist (Jerome Cowan), whom they force to follow an attractive woman, Ann Carlyle (Manx) to her home. They break into an empty house next door, eavesdrop on her, and learn that she is unhappily married to an older man, Roger. They proceed to manipulate the woman, but Boots fails to have relations with her. The two men have a dispute which ends in Duke killing Boots. Roger returns home, fights Duke, and Ann shoots Duke.
