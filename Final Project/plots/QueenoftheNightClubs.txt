After working as a hostess for Nick and Andy, Tex Malone leaves their employ and opens a club of her own. Looking for talent to book for the floor show, Tex hires Bee Walters and thereby breaks up Bees act with Eddie Parr. Andy spitefully kills Texs friend, Holland, and young Eddie is arrested for the crime on circumstantial evidence. Tex then learns from Eddies father, Phil, that Eddie is her long-lost son. At the trial, Tex comes to Eddies defense and persuades one member of the jury that there is reasonable doubt of Eddies guilt. The jury repairs to Texs club, where Tex discovers a piece of evidence that conclusively links Andy with the murder. Eddie is freed, and Tex and Phil get together for a second honeymoon.
