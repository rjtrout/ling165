Atom (Mark Shonsey) is an avid bowler and hardcore horror movie fan. After having his team barred from the championship due to bowling alley corruption and losing his horny girlfriend Emily (Lindy Starr) to sadistic rival bowler Dario (Zachary Byron Helm), Atom suffers a severe head injury, causing him to hallucinate that everyone around him are the flesh-eating undead. Believing the zombie apocalypse has arrived, Atom must defend himself from the "zombies" in the most violent and unpredictable manner possible. Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer has been described as a "love letter to Troma", featuring much of the campy aesthetic and graphic violence and nudity common of the companys films, as well as including many overt references to Troma movies and a cameo appearance from Troma president Lloyd Kaufman.
