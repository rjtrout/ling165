Everyone travels to Hollywood for screen tests and a visit to Graumans Chinese Theater, where they get a kick out of the footprints of movie stars embedded in the cement. Brooke encounters the casting directors own new find, June Lawrence, a singer. He clashes with the studio, which offers a contract only to Mary and sends his other discoveries home. Carolyn doesnt take no for an answer and comes back. Brooke now gets in her corner and schemes to insert footage from her screen test into a theaters newsreel. The next thing they all know, Carolyn is not only a star, Graumans is inviting her to be immortalized in cement.
