While uranium prospector "Blix" Waterberry is in the desert, he wanders into an active atomic bomb test site and is accidentally exposed to radiation from a direct overhead blast. He miraculously survives, becoming radioactive, and in the process gaining special powers. He is then recruited by the FBI to help break up a spy ring.
