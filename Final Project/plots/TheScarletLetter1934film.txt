Hester Prynne has a child out of wedlock and refuses to name the father (who is a respected citizen). For this, she is sentenced to wear a red letter "A" (for adultery). Her husband is long missing and presumed dead. When the husband returns and finds his wife with another mans child, he sets out to torture them. At last, the father reveals himself, with a letter "A" carved in his chest.
