Her daughter Rosalie and Leftys wife Jessie Belle pick up military servicemen in bars and steal from them. Lorrigan keeps an eye on all. He frisks Leftys brother Posey, warning the Dibsons to keep out of trouble. Lefty immediately plans to rob McBain, owner of the bar where Rosalie and Jessie Belle fleece the servicemen. Using guns from pawnbroker Keller, expressly against Mas wishes, Lefty falls into Lt. Lorrigans trap, with undercover cops disguised as soldiers. In the struggle, Posey is accidentally shot. Lefty, Ma and the girls are all placed under arrest.
