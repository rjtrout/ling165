Five men carry out an elaborate plan to rob a gold shipment from a San Francisco bound US mint train. To throw the police off the track, they split up and drive off in three different directions. Two of the gangs gold-laden trucks are captured by the police, but the third makes it all the way to LA where Eddie (Raymond) melts down the gold and disguises it as fittings for his luxury car. On the verge of getting away he is involved in a freeway accident.
