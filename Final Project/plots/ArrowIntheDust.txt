Cavalry deserter Bart Laish comes upon an ambushed wagon and a mortally wounded major. The officers dying request is for Laish to catch up to the remainder of the wagon train and help guide it safely to a fort. Laish transports the majors body, then dons his uniform and assumes his identity when joining up with a wagon train that has been repeatedly attacked by Indians. He is resented at first by Christella Burke, who owns one of the wagons, and Lt. Steve King, who until now has been leading the wagon train. Laish also shoots a crew boss who challenges him. Unable to understand why the Indians keep staging raids against these same wagons, Laish and scout Crowshaw distract them with cases of liquor. They also anger Tillotson, a trader, by using his large wagon as bait. Christella is impressed by Laishs bravery, then accidentally learns of his true identity. Crowshaw ends up shooting Tillotson, whose wagons are filled with guns and ammunition that the Indians have been after all along. Christella falls in love with Laish, who decides to turn himself in, with Lt. King offering to vouch for his character.
