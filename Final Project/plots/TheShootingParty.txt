Meanwhile, the Nettlebys granddaughter Cicely (Rebecca Saire) is allowing herself to be courted by a Hungarian count (Joris Stuyck), much to the chagrin of her mother Ida (Sara Badel). All of the characters personal tensions reach their breaking-point when one of the party is killed accidentally on the final day of shooting, leading the guests to reconsider their relationships.
