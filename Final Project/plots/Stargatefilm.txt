Egyptologist and linguist Daniel Jackson, Ph.D., is invited by Catherine Langford to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs on cover stones that her father had unearthed in Giza, Egypt in 1928. Jackson is taken to a U.S. Air Force installation and told the project is classified information by its commander Special Operations Colonel Jack ONeil. Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a "stargate" which uses constellations as spatial coordinates. On this revelation, Jackson is shown that the base has this Stargate, also discovered by Langfords father. They use Jacksons coordinates to align the Stargates metal ring with markings along its outside, and once all seven are locked in, a wormhole opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins ONeil and other soldiers as they pass through the wormhole. On the arid desert planet, Abydos, they find themselves in a pyramid-like structure. Jackson locates the Stargate and its controls, but lacks the coordinates to return home. ONeil orders some of his men to stay behind to guard the Stargate. Nearby, they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral from the planet. Jackson is able to communicate with them as they speak a variation of Ancient Egyptian, and finds the tribe sees them as emissaries of their god Ra (Jaye Davidson). The tribes chieftain Kasuf presents Jackson with his daughter Shauri as a gift, and though Jackson initially refuses her, he later becomes romantically attached to her. ONeil befriends the teenaged boy Skaara and his friends, in part because Skaara reminds him of his long-deceased son who had shot himself with ONeils service weapon. Through hidden markings and discussions with the tribe, Jackson learns that Ra is an alien being who had come to Earth during the Ancient Egyptian period, looking to possess human bodies to extend his own life. Ra enslaved these humans and brought some to this planet through the Stargate to mine the mineral that is used in the alien technology. The humans on Earth revolted, overthrew Ras overseers, and buried the Stargate to prevent its use. Ra forbade the humans in the tribe from becoming literate, fearing another revolt. During this investigation, Jackson comes across a cartouche containing six of the seven symbols for the Stargate, but the seventh has been broken off. That night, Ras ship lands atop the pyramid structure, and ONeils men there are captured or killed by Ras soldiers. When Jackson, ONeil, and the other men return, they end up in a firefight against Ras soldiers; Jackson is killed and the others are captured. Ra places Jacksons body in a sarcophagus-like device that regenerates him. Ra then explains to Jackson that he has found a nuclear bomb the humans brought and has used his alien technology to increase its explosive power a hundred-fold, and threatens to send it back through the Stargate. Ra orders the human tribe to watch as he prepares to execute Jackson and the others to demonstrate his power, but Skaara and his friends create a diversion that allows Jackson, ONeil, and the others to escape. They flee to nearby caves to hide from Ra. Skaara and his friends celebrate, and Skaara draws out a sign of victory in a wall, which Jackson recognizes as the final symbol. ONeil and his men aid Skaara in overthrowing the remaining overseers, and then launch an attack on Ra. Ra sends out fighter ships against the humans while he orders his ship to depart. The humans outside are forced to surrender to the fighter ships pilots when they run out of ammunition, but the rest of the tribe, having finally learned of their false gods, rebel against the pilots and overthrow them. Shauri is killed, but Jackson takes her body and sneaks aboard Ras ship using a teleportation system, leaving ONeil to fight Ras lead soldier. After Jackson places Shauri in the regeneration device, Ra discovers them and attempts to kill Jackson. ONeil activates the teleportation system, killing Ras lead soldier and allowing Jackson and Shauri to escape the ship. ONeil and Jackson use the teleporter to transport the bomb to Ras ship; the ensuing blast destroys the ship in space. With the humans freed, the remaining team returns to Earth, though Jackson stays behind with Shauri and the others.
