As described in a film magazine, easy going rancher Jeff Bransford (Gibson) returns to his ancestral acres and finds them heavily mortgaged and about to be foreclosed and the hired men defended them with guns. He tries to borrow money to satisfy the mortgage but is unsuccessful. That night a robbery is committed on a neighboring farm with five thousand dollars stolen from Major Parker (MacQuarrie), and suspicion is thrown upon Jeff. After much hard riding and several stiff fights, the real culprits are apprehended and Jeff is vindicated. Parker had intended to loan Jeff some money to help with his difficulties. In return, Jeff saves the married Elinor Parker (Brunette) from running away with a worthless scamp and causing a scandal.
