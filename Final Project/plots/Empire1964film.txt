Empire was filmed at 24 frames per second and is meant to be seen in slow motion at 16 frames per second, extending the 6 1/2 hour length of the film to 8 hours and 5 minutes. It consists of a stationary view toward the Empire State Building lasting the entirety of the running time. The film begins with a blank white screen. As the sun sets almost imperceptibly, the figure of the building emerges and its details become clearer. As the sun sets further, the building is enveloped in darkness. Floodlights on the upper part of the building snap on. Lights in other structures go on and off. In the background, a beacon atop the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower flashes at intervals corresponding to every 15 minutes in real time (it flashes a single time every 15 minutes, and at hour it flashes the time of day). Eventually, the floodlights shut off and the remainder of the film shows nearly total darkness. At three points in the film, reflections of the film crew (including Warhol) can be seen on the windows of the office where filming took place, as the office lights were not turned off before shooting began following a change of film magazines.
