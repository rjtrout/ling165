In the year 1861, just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War in the Colorado Territory, Owen Pentecost (Robert Stack) is a man from North Carolina who comes west to Denver on a whim. He encounters Ann Merry Alaine (Virginia Mayo), who is going there to open a dress shop. In a Denver hotel saloon, Owen wins a poker game with the owner, Jumbo Means (Raymond Burr), who bet his estate on the last hand. Along with the hotel comes Boston Grant (Ruth Roman), who works there. Both women begin to fall for Owen. He has money on his mind, specifically the gold of the towns Confederates, which turns out to be what brought him here. But the predominantly Union town wants the gold, and with the Civil War approaching, the town is split. Owen leads the Southerners in an escape attempt with the gold.
