As the U.S. Subic Bay naval bases operations slowly wind down and naval manpower begins to dwindle, Commander Hamilton (Wolfgang Bodison) relies on three U.S. Navy Seals to help keep the base secure. William Hawk (John Haymes Newton), a longtime American sailor nearing the end of a tour of duty, is involved with a Filipina, Lisa Velasquez (Nanette Medved), a representative of the mayors office in nearby Olongapo City. Lisa has to deal with the economic crisis that the bases closing will bring to her community, as well as her own personal problems brought on by Hawks imminent departure and the strained relationship of her mother, Anna (Daria Ramirez), and stepfather, Ed (James Brolin). Paul Bladon (Alexis Arquette), another Navy Seal at the Subic Bay base, is the son of a U.S. Senator (Michael York), who will be visiting Subic Bay for the bases closing ceremonies. Senator Bladon is bringing along Pauls American girlfriend Angela (Maureen Flannigan), though Paul has fallen in love with a Filipina, Emma (Alma Concepcion), a former prostitute who now plans to marry Paul. The third Navy Seal, John Stryzack (Corin Nemec), is furious over what he sees as Americas betrayal of its responsibilities in the Philippines; he winds up behind bars after a violent incident, but he plans to escape to assassinate Senator Bladon, whom he believes is responsible for the closing of the base.
