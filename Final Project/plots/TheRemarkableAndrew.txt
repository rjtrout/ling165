Young Andrew Long has three interests in life; working as hard as he can as a bookkeeper at his city council, his fianc√©e Peggy Tobin and the study of American History with a hero worship of President and General Andrew Jackson. When Long discovers the municipal books dont add up and money is missing the guilty corrupt parties aim to discredit then imprison him. Long finds his saviour when General Jackson returns to Earth to help him with aid of several other Founding Fathers of the United States.
