Broadway philandering composer Gary Stuart (Ray Milland) discovers to his outrage that while he was taking a brief holiday from his marriage to Constance Stuart (Jane Wyman), she spent an evening in a "country inn" with rival composer Courtney Craig (Tom Helmore). Connie points out the impropriety of Garys own behavior with dancer Lilly Adair (Valerie Bettis), yet when he agrees with her suggestion to consult a lawyer, she is regretful, and the couple get a divorce.
