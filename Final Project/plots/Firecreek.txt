After years of backing away from criminals and gunfights, one resident of the small western town of Firecreek decides to fight back. Part-time sheriff Johnny Cobb (James Stewart) decides to avenge the death of a young man against gunmen led by Bob Larkin (Henry Fonda). Cobb has a lot on his mind, particularly with his wife Henrietta (Jacqueline Scott) about to give birth. He is a peace-loving farmer whose childishly made sheriffs badge is practically an honorary one. Larkins men ride into town and disrupt the peace. Earl (Gary Lockwood), Norman (Jack Elam), and Drew (James Best) run roughshod over the local citizens and Larkin has no inclination to stop it, despite Cobbs requests. Larkin is more interested in getting to know an attractive widow named Evelyn (Inger Stevens). The only person in town willing to help Cobb is a slow-witted stable boy named Arthur (J. Robert Porter). When one of Larkins men attacks a woman, Arthur kills the man. Cobbs wife goes into labour and he has to leave town. While he is gone Larkins men hang Arthur and no one in the town tries to stop them. Cobb cuts Arthur down and goes after Larkin and his men. They all but kill him and he takes them all out except Larkin who is killed by the widow Evelyn as he is about to kill Cobb.
