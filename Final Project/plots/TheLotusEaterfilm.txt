As described in a film magazine, raised aboard a ship, Jacques Leroi (Barrymore) has never seen a woman until after the death of his father, a man who had been disappointed in love. As the only heir, the will stipulates that he is to remain on board until he reaches 25 years of age. On his 25th birthday, he arrives in New York City to consult his lawyer, and meets the gold-digging Madge Vance (Nilsson), who is being courted by John Carson (Sherry). While off the coast of Florida on his yacht with Miss Vance, Jacques has the captain marry them and they go on a long cruise. Upon returning to New York City Jacques discovers that, according to the will, he will not inherit anything until he is 30 years old if he marries in haste. Madge then leaves him. Jacques becomes despondent, and agrees to attempt to cross the Pacific Ocean in a dirigible balloon with the patentee of a new form of gas. The blimp fails to rise above the air currents and he is forced to land on a small island. There he comes upon the strange occupants of the island, people who have been saved from various shipwrecks. They all wear Greek style clothing, eat at restaurants free of charge, and no one works. He falls in love with the native girl Mavis (Moore), but confesses that he has a wife and must return to the United States. The islanders loan him a boat, and he soon returns to New York City, where he discovers that Madge has become engaged to John Carson. Jacques and John await for Madge to keep an appointment only to receive word that she has eloped with a third man. Jacques is elated and returns to the island for the company of his beautiful native maiden.
