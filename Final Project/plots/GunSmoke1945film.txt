"Nevada Jack" McKenzie, retired marshal, comes upon a toppled stagecoach with two dead bodies. In the town of Pawnee, he learns that one of the victims, Hinkley, was an archaeologist who apparently had discovered the whereabouts of hidden Indian treasure. With his friend Sandy Hopkins disguising himself as a medicine man, Nevada Jack investigates and finds that saloonkeeper Lucky Baker is behind the crimes, helped by a hired gun called Knuckles. With the help of cafe owner Jane and the dead mans son, Joel Hinkley, the two marshals fend off Lucky and his criminal band.
