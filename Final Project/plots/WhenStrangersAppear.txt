When Beth (Mitchell) opens her remote roadside diner, she expects another slow day. But almost immediately, Jack (Watson), a handsome drifter burst in, bleeding and on the run. Within moments, the three surfers Jack claims are chasing him appear and the stage is set for a deadly game of cat and mouse as Beth must decide whom to trust and whom to fear. The film features the single "Calling On" from Weta in its soundtrack.
