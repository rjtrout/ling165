Bill Shelby (David Niven) is a globe-trotting author and photographer on assignment from LIFE magazine to do a photo story on Dorinda Hatch, best-selling author of the title book, "The Lady Says No" (Joan Caulfield). Rather than finding a dour spinster, as he expects, she is a young, attractive blonde, who finds her published theories against love and men set on their head. The unbidden thoughts and impulses even invade her subconscious in a dream sequence. It is a battle of the sexes, and the Id and Ego, as the two clash. Bill tries to show her that her book is "all rot"; Dorinda tries to prove her theories that love is just an autonomic function, which isnt really worth it. They find that they all have a lot to learn, and forgive. It looks like sometimes the answer is "no", and sometimes "yes". Mayhem follows, when her errant uncle returns, and they get pulled into the lives of the colorful local characters. It all ends in a barroom brawl, with the police, army, and General trying to restore order.
