Although he is a minister, the young Gil Allen likes to work out in Tom Kellys boxing gym. Gus MacAuliffe, a manager of fighters who doesnt know the young mans true vocation, offers to find him a fight in the ring, but Gil declines. Gil discovers that the church is desperate to raise funds for two things, a swimming pool for children and an iron lung for a hospital. Without disclosing his profession, Gil agrees to let Gus handle him, and Gils first opponent is knocked out with a single punch. The impressed promoter Tony Lorenzo arranges another fight for the kid. Lorenzos girlfriend, Pearl Gorman, a singer with a drinking habit, is immediately attracted to Gil, but when he doesnt reciprocate, she continues to hit the bottle. His superior at the church, Father Ritchie, mentions to Gil that someone mysteriously has donated the first down payment for the iron lung. Gil fibs to the priest that the donor is a well-meaning individual in "the leather business." Gils actual identity is discovered by Pearl, who is inspired by the young ministers example and vows to quit drinking. Gil raises all the money thats needed, then gladly returns to his preferred line of work.
