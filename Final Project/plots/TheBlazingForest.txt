Determined to keep her struggling Nevada timber business going, Jessie Crain borrows money from long-ago sweetheart Syd Jessup while also promising lumberman Kelly Hansen a quarter of her profits if he will become her foreman. Sharon Wilks, restless niece of Jessie who yearns to leave this region and move to the city, is attracted to Kelly immediately. Jessies crew, meanwhile, resents Kellys hard-driving ways, including making everyone work in a torrential rain to meet a lumber quota. A job is given to Jessies brother, lumberjack Joe Morgan, whose embezzling has forced Jessie to pay his debts. Joe continues to create trouble for the lumberman as well as for Grace, his estranged wife. A resentful Syd, meantime, causes a crash in a speeding truck that starts a forest fire and fatally injures Joe. A helicopter rescue saves lives and the business, as Kelly persuades Sharon to stay by his side.
