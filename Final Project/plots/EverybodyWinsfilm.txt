A prominent doctor from New England has been murdered, and his young nephew has been convicted of the crime. A seductive, possibly unstable woman named Angela Crispini persuades a private investigator, Tom OToole, to look into the case. She claims that the youth is innocent and that "everybody" knows who the real killer is. OToole lives with his sister, Connie, who is convinced Crispini is just using him. OToole is determined to get to the bottom of the case, in part due to his contempt for Charley Haggerty, the district attorney. He discovers that Crispini may be a prostitute and that she also had been romantically involved with Haggerty before him. OToole enlists the help of a friendly judge, Murdoch, only to see Crispini seduce and manipulate the judge as well.
