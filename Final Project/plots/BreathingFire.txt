Michael Moore (Jerry Trimble), a Vietnam vet, pulls off a bank heist with his gang, which includes the banks manager. To ensure the loyalty of everyone involved, a set of keys is made to the hiding place for the loot so it can only be opened if all the members are present. These sets of keys were encrusted in a fake pizza mold that was later sliced and given to the gang. The bank manager gets cold feet and tries to back out, but Michael and his henchman arrive to kill him and his wife in their home. The bank managers daughter Annie (Laura Hamilton) gets hold of the key and runs for help to David Moore (Ed Neil), one of her fathers old friends and also a Vietnam vet as well as Michaels brother. David does some investigation, alongside Michaels two sons, Charlie (Jonathan Ke Quan) and Tony (Eddie Saavedra), to find out who murdered the girls parents. They eventually discovered that Michael is the killer. However, trouble brews up when Michael reveals why he adopted his son Charlie, leading to a showdown between father and son. When Michael is arrested, Tony puts the blame on Charlie and intends to settle the score with his brother at a taekwondo tournament. Among other things, Breathing Fire is known for the scene in which the two adolescents battle kung fu midgets in a bar.
