Mammy leaves for her Saturday night bridge club. Tom then rushes to the window and signals to his three alley cat friends, Butch, Topsy, and Lightning that its "ok for the party". They arrive and play loud jazz music. The noise disturbs Jerry, who is trying to go to sleep. He complains to Tom, who ignores him. Jerry tries to disrupt the party by tearing the needle off the phonograph, shutting Topsy in a drawer and slamming the piano lid shut on Butchs hands. The cats chase Jerry back into his mouse hole and resume their party. Jerry soon emerges again and the cats chase him. Tom eventually catches him and ties him up with windowsill string. Nevertheless, Jerry has had enough, so he is able to reach the telephone and calls Mammy, telling her about the party. Mammy races back home (during which scene her face is briefly shown for the one and only time). She confronts the cats. Tom tries to run but Mammy grabs him by the tail and unleashes her wrath, throwing all four cats out the front door. At home, Mammy badmouths the cats for ruining her entire evening. To Jerrys dismay, she then decides to relax by playing the same jazz recording that the cats were playing, leaving him no better off than before.
