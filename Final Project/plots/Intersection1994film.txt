Vincent Eastman and his wife, Sally, run an architectural firm together. He is the architect and creative director while she is in charge of the business end. Unhappy at home, Vincent encounters a journalist, Olivia, and a romantic spark ignites between them. They attend an antique sale together and begin seeing each other whenever possible. After a quarrel with Sally at home, he moves out. Vincent is torn between his marriage and the possibility of a new future with Olivia, and cant decide what he wants. Thinking that the best course of action for everyone involved is to stay in his unhappy marriage, Vincent writes a letter to Olivia explaining that he is going back to his wife but does not mail it. Shorty after, he stops at a convenience store in the country and sees a little girl who reminds him of Olivia, and his true feelings become too obvious to ignore--he then calls Olivia and leaves a message on her answering machine telling her that he loves her, wants to start a life with her, and that hes certain about his choice. While speeding back to the city to be with Olivia, he is in a car accident and dies. Since Sally is still technically his wife, she receives his belongings at the hospital and finds the unsent letter to Olivia. When Olivia shows up at the hospital, Sally doesnt tell her about the letter; in turn, Olivia doesnt tell Sally about the message that Vincent left for her--this leaves both women believing that he loved them more than the other.
