Kay Kyser, his band, and several entertainers begin a tour of overseas U.S. military forces. In Australia, the group is approached by a stranded American teen-ager, Marcy McGuire, who pleads with Kyser for him to take her with them when they leave. Kyser refuses, but this does not deter McGuire, who stows away on the groups plane heading for India. When she is discovered, the American authorities insist she be returned to Australia, but Kyser agrees to take responsibility for her. Meanwhile, Kysers entourage is infatuated with obtaining historical relics from the cultures they visit. When the group reaches their next stop, China, Auer procures a scarab ring which supposedly belonged to the Borgias, not realizing that the ring contains a secret Nazi document. While in China, Marcy becomes a performer in Kysers band. As the Nazis now attempt to retrieve the document, the band moves on to Egypt. The Nazis attempt to obtain the ring, but are foiled again. The group moves on to Tunisia, and finally Monrovia. In Monrovia, Marcy learns that her father, who was in the Army Air Corps, has been killed in action. Regardless of her new knowledge, Marcy manages to take the stage with her new colleagues.
