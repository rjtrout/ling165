Los Angeles psychologist Chapman (Andrew Duggan) and his assistant Paul Radford (Efrem Zimbalist Jr) are looking for volunteers for their sex survey, and four women volunteer: Sarah Garnell (Shelley Winters), a middle-aged woman who is having an affair with young theater director Fred Linden (Ray Danton); Teresa Harnish (Glynis Johns), a happily married woman who becomes attracted to brawny football player Ed Kraski (Ty Hardin); Naomi Shields (Claire Bloom), an alcoholic nymphomaniac who takes up with an unsavory jazz musician; and Kathleen Barclay (Jane Fonda), a young widow who thinks she is frigid.
