Billy Jack is a "half-breed" American Navajo Indian, a Green Beret Vietnam War veteran, and a hapkido master. Jack defends the hippie-themed Freedom School and students from townspeople who do not understand or like the counterculture students. The school is organized by its director Jean Roberts (Delores Taylor). A group of children of various races from the school go to town for ice cream and are refused service and then abused and humiliated by Bernard Posner (David Roya), the son of the countys corrupt political boss (Bert Freed), and his gang. This prompts a violent outburst by Billy. Later. Jean is raped by Bernard, who also murders an Indian student. Billy confronts Bernard, whom he catches in bed with a 13-year-old girl, and sustains a gunshot wound before killing him with a hand strike to the throat. After a climactic shootout with the police and pleading with Jean, Billy Jack surrenders to the authorities and is arrested. As he is driven away, a large crowd of supporters raise their fists as a show of defiance and support.
