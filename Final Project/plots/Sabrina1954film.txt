Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn) is the young daughter of the Larrabee familys chauffeur, Thomas (John Williams), and she has been in love with David Larrabee (William Holden) all her life. David is an oft-married, idle playboy, crazy for women, who has never noticed Sabrina, much to her and the household staffs dismay. Distraught, she leaves her father a suicide note and tries to kill herself by carbon monoxide poisoning. She fails when Davids workaholic older brother, Linus (Humphrey Bogart) intervenes. Sabrina then attends culinary school in Paris, and after two years she returns home as an attractive and sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her. Linus sees this and fears that Davids imminent marriage to Elizabeth Tyson (Martha Hyer) may be endangered. If the engagement is broken, it would ruin a profitable opportunity on a great corporate merger between Larrabee Industries and Elizabeths very wealthy fathers business. Linus confronts David about his irresponsibility to the family, the business, and Elizabeth, but David is unrepentant. Linus then tries to distract Sabrina from David by drawing her affections to himself. He succeeds, but in the process falls in love with her, though he cannot admit this even to himself. Linus reveals his maneuver to Sabrina, leaving her disillusioned about him and David. Sabrina agrees to leave and never come back, and Linus arranges for her to return to Paris by ship the next day. The next morning, Linus has second thoughts and decides to send David to Paris with Sabrina. This means calling off Davids wedding with Elizabeth and the big Tyson deal, and he schedules a meeting of the Larrabee board to announce this. However, David shows up at the meeting and declares that hes decided to marry Elizabeth after all. David helps Linus recognize his own feelings for Sabrina, and assists him in rushing off to join Sabrinas ship before it leaves harbor. Linus and Sabrina meet on board and sail away together to Paris.
