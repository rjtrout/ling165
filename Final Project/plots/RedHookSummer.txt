Flik Royale is a pampered 13-year-old boy from Atlanta who is sent to live with his preacher grandfather, Da Good Bishop Enoch Rouse, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. In the midst a sermon, a strange man strolls into the back of the church and accuses Bishop Enoch of sexual molestation 15 years earlier in Georgia. Enoch then admits that it was subsequently covered up by his church, which paid the boys family hush money and let Enoch go free to start a new life in Brooklyn. The news causes members of his new congregation to turn against him and beat him.
