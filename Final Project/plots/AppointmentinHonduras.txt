Taking place in 1910, during a fictional revolution in Honduras, Corbett was hired to ensure that a large sum of money came to the deposed political leader. Sylvia Sheppard (Ann Sheridan) and her wealthy husband Harry Sheppard (Zachary Scott) are unwilling hostages of Jim Corbett (Glenn Ford), who is accompanied through the jungle by several wanted criminals. Sylvia, ever the unfaithful wife, eventually falls in love with Corbett. They encounter various dangers, including crocodiles, "tiger fish," large snakes, biting ants, a huge swarm of some unnamed, assumedly stinging, insect, malaria, and armed insurgents.
