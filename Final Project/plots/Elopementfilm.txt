Jacqueline "Jake" Osborne (Anne Francis) is sent to college to follow in the footsteps of her successful father Howard (Clifton Webb), only to fall in love with professor Matt Reagan (William Lundigan). They impulsively decide to elope. Howard and his wife (Margalo Gillmore) are furious, but when they confront the young professors parents, they find them equally irate. The parents hit the road together hoping to head off the kids marriage plans, while Jake and Matt begin to bicker and wonder if maybe things are going a little too fast.
