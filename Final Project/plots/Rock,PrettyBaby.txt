Young musician Jimmy Daley needs to come up with $300 to purchase the electric guitar he wants. He pawns his law books, to the disappointment of his father, a doctor whose goal is for Jimmy to become a lawyer. Jimmys jealous nature results in a ruckus at a party and $150 in damage to a neighbor, which Dr. Daley insists his son pay. His girlfriend Joan Wright learns that a battle of the bands has a cash prize. Jimmy and his group end up losing the contest, but he earns the respect of his dad.
