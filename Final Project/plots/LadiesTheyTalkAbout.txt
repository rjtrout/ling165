Nan Taylor (Barbara Stanwyck) is a member of a gang of bank robbers, posing as a regular customer to distract the security guard while her accomplices take the money. Her cover is blown by a policeman who had arrested her before, and she is arrested. Reform-minded radio star David Slade (Preston Foster) falls in love with her and gets her released as a favor from District Attorney Simpson (Robert McWade). However, when she confesses that she is guilty, Simpson has her imprisoned. At San Quentin State Prison, Nan meets fellow inmates Linda (Lillian Roth), "Sister Susie" (Dorothy Burgess) and Aunt Maggie (Maude Eburne), as well as prison matron Noonan (Ruth Donnelly). Slade continues to send Nan letters, but she refuses his entreaties. Meanwhile, Linda has a fancy for Slade, and resents Nan for spurring him. Her bank accomplice, Lefty (Harold Huber) visits her, and tells her that Don is now imprisoned in the mens section on the other side of the wall. Lefty tells her to make a map of the womens section as well as a copy of the matrons key so that the men can escape via the womens section of the prison. However, Nan believes Slade told the prison officials about the escape plot and Don is shot dead as he gets to Nans cell to break her out. Nan is given another year, and is not allowed visitors, but vows to seek revenge on Slade. When she is released, Nan goes to a revival group meeting hosted by Slade. He is glad to see her, and she is escorted to a back room where he professes his love for her. She scoffs and accuses him of turning in her bank robber accomplices. She shoots him but misses, hitting him in the arm. Sister Susie sees this from outside via a keyhole, but Slade denies that he has been shot, and Slade and Nan announce their intention to marry.
