After coming off a successful comedy tour, Dolemite throws a get-together at his mansion. The party is crashed by racist police officers, and they find out that the Sheriffs wife is offering Dolemite money for sexual services. When the sheriff catches them red handed, he shoots and kills his wife. Dolemite and his friends kidnap a young man and decide to head to California to meet Queen Bee. There, they find out that the local mob boss, Joe Cavaletti, kidnapped two of Queen Bees girls, forcing her to close her business and work for him. Dolemite rescues Queen Bee, her girls and teaches his enemies a lesson all while being chased by the sheriff, who has pinned the murder of his own wife on Dolemite.
