During the last days of the Civil War, President Lincoln (James Griffith) selects Indian scout James Kingston (Bill Williams) to facilitate a cattle shipment from Texas to the north. He is helped by cattle driver Oâ€™Roarke (Ray Teal) and Maj. McGuire (Don Harvey). Mexican fanatic Joaquin Jironza (Alex Montoya) wants the Henry Repeating Rifles that Kingston has. Embittered ex-rebel leader Lee Parker (Richard Jaeckel) is also an obstacle to Kingstons mission, as he tries to get the cattle through Apache territory.
