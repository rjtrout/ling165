As described in a film magazine, because of his ability to fix things Dick Remington (Fairbanks) becomes known as "Mr. Fix-It" and enters the aristocratic home of the Burroughs as their nephew. Before long he has melted the stone hearts of three aunts and one uncle and won the heart of Mary McCullough (Hawley) in addition to setting aright the affairs of pretty Georgiana Burroughs (MacDonald) and Olive Van Tassell (Landis).
