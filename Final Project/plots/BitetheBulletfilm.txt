Based on actual events of the early twentieth century, the story concerns a grueling 700-mile (1,100 km) cross-country horse race in 1906, with a winner-take-all prize of $2,000 ($54,500 today), and the way it affects the lives of its various participants. The colorful contestants include two former Rough Riders (Hackman and Coburn) who cant let friendship come between them if they intend to win, a lady of little virtue (Bergen), a punk kid (Vincent), an old cowhand in poor health (Johnson), an English gentleman (Bannen) whos competing just for the sheer sport of it all, and a Mexican with a toothache (Mario Arteaga) who literally needs to bite the bullet. All must race against a thoroughbred of championship pedigree owned by a wealthy man (Coleman) who has no intention of seeing his entry lose. The film touches on the themes of sportsmanship, animal cruelty, the yellow press, racism, the end of the Old West and the bonds of marriage and friendship. As the race progresses, the conditions test not only the endurance of horses and riders but also their philosophies of life and the meaning of victory and defeat.
