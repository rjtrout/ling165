The town of Pitchfork, Arkansas makes national headlines when Esmeralda the sow gives birth to 18 piglets. Among the visitors to Pitchfork are a troupe of showgirls hoping to entertain the visitors and a folk music group returning to their home after their touring is through. In addition to the artists a meat packing company sends two men to investigate what made Esmeralda give birth to so many piglets and to bring the secret back to increase meat production.
