The Arena, set in the ancient Roman town of Brundusium, is about a group of slave girls who are sold to a man named Timarchus (Daniele Vargas), the organizer of the events that take place in the townâ€™s colosseum. After a fight breaks out amongst the girls, Timarchus gets the idea of putting the women in the ring to fight to the death. The recently captured Mamawi (Pam Grier) and Bodicia (Margaret Markov) realize they must stick together if they are to survive.
