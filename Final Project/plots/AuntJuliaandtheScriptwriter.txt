Set in Peru during the 1950s, it is the story of an 18-year-old student who falls for a 32-year-old divorcee. The novel is based on the authors real life experience. Mario, an aspiring writer, works at a radio station, Panamericana, writing news bulletins alongside the disaster-obsessed Pascual. Mario has an aunt (married to a biological uncle) whose sister, Julia, has just been divorced and has come to live with some of his family members. He frequently sees her and though at first they dont get on, they start to go to movies together and gradually become romantically involved. Marios bosses also run Panamericanas sister station, which broadcasts novelas (short-run soap operas). Theyre having problems buying the serials on bulk from Cuba, with batches of scripts being ruined and quality being poor, and hence they hire a highly eccentric Bolivian scriptwriter named Pedro Camacho to write the serials. The novel chronicles the scriptwriters rise and fall in tandem with the protagonists affair and includes episodes of Pedros serials, in prose form. These scripts tend to shed light on what the latter is like and has done, and change depending on what hes going through.
