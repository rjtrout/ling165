Andrea Walker, known as Andi, is a girl who does not want to move to her animal-allergic great-aunt Alice because to do so would mean having to say goodbye to her beloved dog Bebe, which will be living with another family until Andis family finds a new home for themselves because of her. Regardless of this, she is forced to go. However, shortly after the move, she finds a stranded dog and wishes to keep her. Andis mother vetoes this idea, so, along with her older brother Bruce, she keeps the dog (which she names Friday) and her pups in an abandoned house across the street. After a while, Andi and Bruce allow in three more partners, Tim, Debbie, and Tiffany, and eight more dogs: Red Rover (an Irish Setter that ran away from his abusive owner and Andi and Bruces enemy, Jerry Gordon, who is Aunt Alices neighbor and pretends to be nice), MacTavish (an abandoned dog left by his owner and eats scraps and sometimes food from kids), Preston (a praying beagle), and five "Bulldales" (puppies owned by Tiffany, and her father threatens to drown them if they are not sold.) In the end, their expenses overwhelm them, and they are discovered by their father, mother, and aunt. During a final scene, Jerrys wickedness is revealed to his ignorant father, prompting him to sell Red Rover. Also, all the dogs living in the hotel leave it. Red Rover (which Bruce wants to adopt), Friday, and Bebe return home with the Walkers when they move out of Aunt Alices house, MacTavish is adopted by Tim, the Bulldales find a home, Preston returns to his home, and Andis writing is finally published.
