A college buys her residential building and intends to evict her, but elderly Sarah Freeman explains that she has an iron-clad lease that only she can break. School representative Jim Parsons agrees to let her stay, whereupon incoming male students discover that an old woman will be sharing their dorm. The boys take a liking to Sarah, who has spent 27 years there waiting for the return of a missing grandson, unwilling to believe he is gone for good. After she helps a young couple, Lucia and Tom, with their romance and studies, Sarah believes the missing boy is about to visit at long last. Her heart gives out from the excitement. Soon thereafter, a friend reveals that the boy was killed many years ago, but that no one had been able to get Sarah to accept it.
