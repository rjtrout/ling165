A scientific corporation of ill repute, Genetic Laboratories, loses control of a test subjectâ€”a poisonous, mutant cat (the Uninvited) that inhabits the body of an ostensibly benign house cat. At the behest of two attractive co-eds, the Uninvited is offered lodging aboard the luxury yacht of a duplicitous arbitrageur, "Wall Street" Walter Graham, en route to the Cayman Islands to escape criminal prosecution by the SEC. Ensuing challenges to the Uninviteds viability result in widespread carnage.
