In court, criminal attorney John Campbell defends a man, Frank Bricolle, who is charged with murdering a night watchman in a fur warehouse during a robbery. Frank having saved his life during the war, John believes in him so much that both he and wife Ruth provide the defendant with an alibi, resulting in his acquittal. Frank later confesses to John how he did indeed commit the crime, aided by Joe Corsi and other accomplices. John expresses regret for his actions and leaves Ruth, wanting to be alone for a while. He is actually busy scheming to frame Corsi for the murder. Corsi tries to avoid a conviction by accusing Bricolle in the courtroom, where Bricolle pulls a gun and tries to shoot his way out. He is killed, and John returns home to Ruth.
