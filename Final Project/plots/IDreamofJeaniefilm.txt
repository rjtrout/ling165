In 1849 the song Oh, Susannah is a nationwide hitâ€”but bookkeeper Stephen Foster has given his work to several music houses without charge and without credit. His refined true love Inez McDowell, a classically trained singer, despises popular music, especially Stephens songs. Fosters world changes when Edwin P. Christy sets him straight on the music business and launches his career as an author of the songs the Christy Minstrels use in their shows.
