Years have passed since the death of her daughter, Emma. Aurora Greenway is still her usual strong, willful self, but all is not well with the three grandchildren she raised after Emmas death, particularly eldest boy Tommy, who is serving time in jail on a drug charge. Younger grandson Teddy now has a girlfriend and a son. Melanie (who is both the youngest and the only girl out of the three grandkids), is all but grown and still living with Aurora at home but giving serious thought to moving out. Auroras only true companion is housekeeper Rosie, particularly now that a man shes been spending time with, the General, is a friend, not a romance. Her late daughters old friend, Patsy, still has a home in Houston and thinks of herself as Auroras friend now, dispensing advice to Melanie, something that Aurora does not appreciate. Rosie is being courted by an elderly gentleman named Arthur, who has bought astronaut Garrett Breedloves former house next door. On seeing how lonely Aurora obviously is, Rosie tricks her into seeing a licensed counselor, Jerry, to whom Aurora admits that she is still seeking "the love of my life." Thoroughly unprofessional in almost every way, Jerry jumps into a romantic situation with Aurora himself. However, he has an ulterior motive, which she soon learns. Aurora is cheered up only by a brief visit from Garrett, who advises her to find that true love soon because "there arent that many shopping days left till Christmas." Needing a cause, Aurora decides to take charge after Melanie moves to California to try to become an actress. She is peeved to discover that Patsy has exactly the same idea. Melanie succeeds in landing a role on a television show. Aurora comes home to a new problem, however, when it turns out that Rosie is critically ill. She is left once more facing the prospect of being alone.
