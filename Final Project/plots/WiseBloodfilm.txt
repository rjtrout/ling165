Wise Blood follows the troubled life of Hazel "Haze" Motes, a 22-year-old veteran of an unspecified war and a preacher of the Church of Truth Without Christ. The Church – a "religious" organization of Hazes own creation – serves to further his bitter, passion-fueled and often spiteful words against anyone or anything representing a belief in God, an afterlife, judgment, sin or evil. Hazel Motes himself is quite "peculiar", as his unique "head-down speed walk" he demonstrates throughout the film might suggest. His attire is a crisp, black hat and sharp dark grey suit, which complements his tall, lean, lanky figure remarkably well. Various women he encounters like the seductive Sabbath Lily Hawks, are seemingly charmed by his unusual, dark demeanor; likewise, other individuals, like the dog-like Enoch Emery, are simply drawn to him with the innocent intent of befriending Hazel. Motes is incapable, however, of maintaining any such relationships. A borderline sociopath, he is never content with either himself or anyone else he encounters and feels the unceasing stirring need to pursue the foundation of his anti-church, devoting his every waking moment to attracting followers to his organization. Over the course of the film, his time in the crumbling, hostile Georgian city of Taulkinham, and his various encounters with the strange people within, lead him to an odd territorial war over street preaching between the faux-blind Asa Hawks and the piggish copycat Hoover Shoates, and then eventually to a violent confrontation with the destiny he has been avoiding.
