After his father wins the Olympic decathlon but is disqualified for being judged a paid professional athlete rather than an amateur, Johnny Kent becomes a rising star in the athletic world himself. William Stevens, the runner-up who received the gold medal after John Kent was stripped of it, has a daughter, Joan, who begins seeing young Johnny socially while he trains. The distraction she causes, combined with a rivalry with Duke Hale in competition both in sports and for the girl, complicates matters as Johnnys quest continues.
