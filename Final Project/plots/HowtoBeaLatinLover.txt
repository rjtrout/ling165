Having made a career of seducing rich older women, Maximo marries a wealthy woman more than twice his age. 25 years later, spoiled, out of shape and bored from waking up next to his now 80-year-old wife, he gets the surprise of his life when she ends up dumping him for a younger car salesman. Forced out of his mansion and desperate for a place to stay, he crashes in the upscale playhouse of another gigolo, Ricks older girlfriends granddaughter, and eventually moves in with his estranged sister, Sara and her nerdy son, Hugo in their small apartment. Anxious to return to the lap of luxury, Maximo uses his nephew’s crush on classmate Arden to get to his new target—her grandmother, Celeste, a widowed billionaire. Maximo teaches his nephew some tricks he thinks work on women, during which he finds himself bonding with his nephew Hugo. Maximo tries to reignite his charm as a Latin lover, and fails at it miserably. Sara comes to know of Maximos scamming and kicks him out. Eventually, he moves in with Ricks older girlfriend, who had a crush on him, and patches up the relationship with his sister and nephew.
