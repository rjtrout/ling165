Mary Blake insists that mild-mannered insurance salesman Henry Twinkle demand a raise if they intend to get married. Henry earns praise and a raise from his boss when he sells a valuable policy to a man named Gus Fender. Fender turns out to be a gangster with a huge reward for anyone who brings him in, dead or alive. Henrys furious boss orders him to personally assure Fender doesnt end up dead. Fender and his moll, Lila Hanley, however, dupe Henry into a scheme in which theyll end up with the reward money themselves. Henry foolishly tries to pay them with a check. Mary, who quit her job after Henrys raise, bemoans his acceptance of a worthless stock and even sues him to get back money she feels shes got coming. The stock ends up valuable after all and Henry ends up with $150,000 in hand. He naively gives Fender a fistful of cash, which then accidentally gets burned into ashes.
