In 1962, Tracy Turnblad is a heavyset high school student living in Baltimore. Along with her classmate Penny Pingleton, Tracy frequently watches The Corny Collins Show, a local teen dance television show. The teenagers featured on the show attend Tracy and Pennys school, among them Amber von Tussle and her boyfriend Link Larkin, the lead male dancer. Amber’s mother, Velma, manages WYZT, ensuring that Amber is prominently featured. Collins and the dancers on the show are white, and Velma only allows African-American kids on the show once a month on "Negro Day", hosted by R&B disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle. One day, one of the dancers on the show takes a leave of absence, and auditions for a replacement are held. Tracy attends, but Velma turns her down for her overweight physique and for supporting integration. Tracy is given detention for skipping school, and discovers the "Negro Day" kids practicing in the detention room. Tracy befriends Seaweed, the students best dancer and Motormouth Maybelles son, who teaches Tracy several dance moves. As Tracy leaves detention, she inadvertently bumps into Link, and dreams of a life with him. At a record hop, Tracy’s moves attract the attention of Collins, and he chooses her to join the show. Tracy becomes one of Cornys most popular performers, threatening Ambers chances of winning the shows yearly "Miss Teenage Hairspray" pageant and her relationship with Link, as he grows fonder of Tracy. Mr. Pinky suggests that Tracy should be the spokesgirl for his Hefty Hideaway boutique. Tracy persuades her agoraphobic mother, Edna, to accompany her to the boutique as her agent. Tracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two are smitten. Later, when Tracy and Link are in detention, Seaweed invites the girls and Link to follow him and his sister, Little Inez, to a party at Maybelles store. Edna finds Tracy there and tries taking her home, but Maybelle convinces her to stay, and tells her to take pride in herself. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has canceled "Negro Day", and Tracy suggests that they march for integration. Edna returns to her husband Wilburs shop, but Velma gets there first, and tries to seduce him. After accusing Wilbur of infidelity, Edna forbids Tracy to be on the show. She changes her mind after she and Wilbur reconcile. The next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest, which is halted by a police roadblock. The protesters engage in a brawl, while Tracy runs to the Pingletons home, and hides in a fallout shelter. However, Pennys mother, Prudence, reports Tracy to the police before tying her daughter to her bed. Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her, and realizes that he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape. With the pageant underway, Velma places police officers around WYZT to prevent Tracy from entering. She also changes the pageant tallies, so Amber is guaranteed to win. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Seaweeds sister, Little Inez, to the stage to dance in the pageant. Ambers attempt to re-claim her championship crown fails. Little Inez wins the pageant after a late surge of support, successfully integrating The Corny Collins Show. Velma tells Amber about her rigging scheme in front of a camera planted by Edna, resulting in her firing. The Corny Collins Show set turns into a celebration as Tracy and Link kiss.
