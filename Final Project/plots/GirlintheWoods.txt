Steve and Bell Cory arrive in timber country, where Bell is eager to begin a new life, tired of moving from place to place and weary of Steves gambling habit. A lumber baron, Whitlock, has recently laid claim to land belonging to another man, who begins poaching logs from him. Whitlocks foreman, Big Jim, offers a job to Steve, who must fend off romantic advances from Jims young and restless daughter, Sonda. In a snit over Steves rejection, Sonda helps point out the whereabout of the man Whitlocks after, who is then shot, with Steve being blamed. Bell is furious with Steves behavior until finally realizing that none of it has been his fault.
