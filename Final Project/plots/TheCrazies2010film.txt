In the town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa, local sheriff David Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) is enjoying a baseball game when it is interrupted by a crazed local resident entering the outfield with a shotgun. David attempts to dissuade him, but is forced to kill him when he raises his weapon. David and his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell), the lA community family doctor, has begun to notice another town resident exhibiting bizarre behavior, including lifeless and repetitive speech. The next night a local farmer Judy had seen just that morning locks his wife and son inside their farm house and burns it down, and then "mows the goddamn lawn". Learning of a pilots body found in a swamp, David and his deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) investigate it. They discover a military aircraft that crashed into the river a few days before. Suspecting a link between the contaminated water and the residents bizarre behavior, David attempts to have the towns water supply shut off, but is denied. He does so anyway, knowing it may cost him his job. Soon after, all communication services are lost in town and David urges his wife to leave and go to her parents house, but she refuses. Suddenly soldiers arrive to take all residents to quarantine at a high school. Everyone is examined for symptoms of infection. Judy does not pass the examination (later we find out the reason is that she is pregnant) and is separated from David. David escapes evacuation and heads back to his office, encountering Russell. The two head for the school to free Judy. At the school, the infected townspeople breach the perimeter, and the military personnel evacuate, abandoning the civilians. Judy wakes up strapped to a gurney, and helplessly watches as a crazed school director kills quarantined people one by one. David and Russell save her and also find Becca (Danielle Panabaker), a hospital assistant. Unable to find a working vehicle, the four make their way out of town on foot. They encounter Beccas boyfriend, Scotty, at his farm. Soldiers raid the farm, shoot Scotty and his mother, and burn the bodies. They learn that the soldiers have been ordered to shoot all civilians. The group repair an older patrol car in Davids garage, and are ambushed by the infected family of Rory. After a struggle, Russell furiously shoots the infected multiple times. This greatly disturbs Judy, who argues with David about Russells state of mind. On the road, they are spotted by an attack helicopter and drive into a car wash for cover. The workers attack the car and drag Becca out with a wrapped hose, breaking her neck. When the rest of the group leaves the car to help her, the helicopter destroys the car. While walking down the road, the group spots a black SUV speeding toward them, which Russell disables with a police spike strip. The driver, a government employee, reveals the cargo plane contained "Trixie," a "Rhabdoviridae prototype" biological weapon. It was en route to Texas to be destroyed when the plane crashed. Enraged, Russell shoots him and threatens Judy and David. When confronted about his behavior, Russell realizes he is infected and, after being disarmed, begs to go on with Judy and David. At a roadblock, Russel volunteers to distract the soldiers so that Judy and David can sneak past. He calls out the soldiers on their actions and gets killed. David and Judy arrive at a truck stop to search for a vehicle, discovering that the military have also executed those who were evacuated. Judy kills an infected while David fights with another infected and burns its body, killing it. They escape in a semi-truck, but as they drive away, a massive explosion destroys Ogden Marsh and causes a shock wave that flips over their vehicle. As the couple walk towards Cedar Rapids, a view from a military satellite highlights first the couple, then the city, and the words "Initiate containment protocol" appear, signifying a new containment task. In the credits, Bruce Aune, a real newscaster from KCRG-TV 9 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa reports that an explosion originating from the Dakon Pendrill chemical plant started a massive fire in Ogden Marsh. He says a perimeter has been set and civilians are not being allowed into the area. A Trixie-infected individual appears on camera just before the signal is lost.
