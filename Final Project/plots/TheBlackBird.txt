When San Francisco private detective Sam Spade dies, his son, Sam, Jr., inherits his fathers agency, including the sarcastic secretary, Effie Perine (also known as "Godzilla"). He must also continue his fathers tradition of "serving minorities." When Caspar Gutman is killed outside Spades building, his dying words are, "Its black and as long as your arm." Spade is given an offer by a member of the Order of St. Johns Hospital to purchase his fathers useless copy of the Maltese Falcon. A right-wing thug named Gordon Immerman has been hired to make sure Spade delivers the bird. He later gets an offer from Wilmer Cook for the Falcon, but before they can negotiate, he is killed. Shortly thereafter he meets a beautiful and mysterious Russian woman named Anna Kemidov, daughter of the general who once owned the real Maltese Falcon. She also wants Spades copy and is willing to seduce him to get it. Spade is soon dealing with Litvak, a bald Nazi dwarf who is surrounded by an army of Hawaiian thugs. In the ensuing chaos, Immerman tries to become Spades partner. Spade discovers that his "false" copy may be the real thing.
