Broadway leading lady Valerie Stanton (Russell), accidentally kills her producer and former lover, Gordon Dunning (Ames), during an argument about the direction her career should take. He expects her to sign for his next production, a typical frothy comedy for which he is known, whereas she wants to star in a revival of Hedda Gabler to prove her versatility as an actress. Other characters involved in the plot are Michael Morrell (Genn), Valeries new beau; supporting actress Marian Webster (Trevor), who is accused of committing Valeries crime; and police Capt. Danbury (Greenstreet), who may know more than he is willing to disclose.
