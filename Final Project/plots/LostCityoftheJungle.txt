Recent atom tests show a certain element that can be used as defense against the atomic bomb. War monger Sir Eric Hazarias (Lionel Atwill) has traced the element, dubbed Meteorium 245, to the Himalayan province of Pendrang, ruled over by casino owner Indra (Helen Bennett). Hazarias fakes his own death and shows up in Pendrang as philanthropist Geoffrey London along with his secretary Malborn (John Mylong), who is secretly the real war monger, Hazarias being his beard, and they start an archaeological dig for the legendary Lost City of Pendrang as a cover for their search for Meteorium. United Peace Foundation operative Rod Stanton (Russell Hayden) arrives in Pendrang soon after having trailed Hazarias there with a twofold mission, prove London is really Hazarias and find out what he is looking for in Pendrang.
