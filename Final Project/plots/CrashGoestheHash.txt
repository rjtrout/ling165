Fuller Bull (Vernon Dent), the head of the ailing Daily News, confronts the reporters he hired for not getting him a story to keep up with a competing newspaper called the Daily Star Press. Fuller Bull catches three shirtmen (the Stooges) outside; thinking they are reporters from the Daily Star Press, he immediately hires them to get a picture of visiting Prince Shaam of Ubeedarn (Dick Curtis). Word has it that Shaam has plans to marry local wealthy socialite Mrs. Van Bustle (Symona Boniface). The trio disguise themselves as servants, and work their way into a party being held at Mrs. Van Bustles home in the honor of the prince. The Stooges all but sabotage the festivity by serving hors d≈ìuvres consisting of peas and dog biscuits, along with a turkey stuffed with a live parrot. The prince leaves in disgust, with the butler (Bud Jamison) following close behind. Undaunted, the Stooges manage to expose both the prince and butler as crooks who were planning to rob the house. The next day, the Stooges tells Fuller Bull that a man claiming to be Prince Shaam is not a prince and they had both him and the butler arrested. As a result of their findings, Bull becomes overwhelmed with joy, and tells the people printing the paper to stop the presses for an extra. He gives the boys a large bonus, and Mrs. Van Bustle thanks the boys for preventing her from marrying Shaam.
