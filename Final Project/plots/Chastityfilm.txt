Chastity (Cher) is a young hippie runaway who drifts and hitchhikes aimlessly, reflecting on life and love. She survives by her wits, engaging in occasional scams (such as pretending to be a gas station attendant and keeping the customers payment) and accepting offers of rides, food and lodging from men she meets, but firmly and coldly rejecting any sexual advances that come with these offers. Sometimes she is childlike, other times she is angry or destructive for seemingly no reason. She chose the name "Chastity" for herself from the dictionary because it meant "abstinence, purity, freedom from ornamentation, simplicity." Chastity meets a law student named Eddie (Stephen Whittaker) who is kind to her, and briefly stays with him at his house. Next she travels over the border to Mexico, ending up in a brothel run by lesbian madam Diana Midnight (Barbara London). After Chastity rips off an inexperienced young male customer, Diana takes a personal interest in her and the two begin a brief romantic relationship. At first, Chastity seems happy with Diana, despite Chastitys expressed hatred of being touched. However, Chastity soon becomes angry with Diana, runs away and returns to Eddie, whom she renames "Andre". Eddie and Chastity live together for a short time and Chastity seems to finally be settled in a traditional relationship. But when Eddie is out, Chastity begins to hear in her head the voices of her parents talking about how she was sexually abused when she was younger (providing the motivation for Chastitys behavior up to this point). Crying and traumatized, Chastity overturns the dining room table, writes "I think I love you" on Eddies kitchen wall and runs away again, heading for the highway. A truck driver pulls up to offer her a lift, but Chastity hesitates about getting in, and the film ends without showing whether she accepts the ride.
