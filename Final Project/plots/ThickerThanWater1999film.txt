In Los Angeles, two rival gang leaders are also trying to be music producers. When DJs (Mack 10) equipment shorts out and Lonzo (Fat Joe) is cut out of the action by a record producer, the two join forces, which also requires a tentative peace between gangs. With backing from Gator (CJ Mac), a smooth New Orleans drug king, DJ and Lonzo start drug dealing, organizing their gangs into pushers. Just as their finances are looking up, one of Gators team pulls a double cross and two of DJ and Lonzos gang bangers start a shooting war. Can the erstwhile music producers salvage anything of their bond or their plans?
