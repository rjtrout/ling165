A former stewardess, widow Julie Benton is terrorized by her insanely jealous second husband, Lyle. It becomes a life-or-death matter after friend Cliff Henderson relays his suspicions to Julie that her first husbands death might not have been a suicide. She pretends that she would have fallen for Lyle even if her first husband had still been alive, and Lyle confesses the murder to her. Julie flees with Cliffs help, but police are unable to arrest Lyle without proof. Julie instead changes her identity, moves north and returns to her former job with the airline. Lyle has a confrontation with Cliff, shoots him and learns where Julie can be found. With police in pursuit, Julie is warned that Lyle might be on her flight. She spots him, but Lyle pulls a gun on her, then kills the pilot before being shot himself. Julie must be instructed on how to land the aircraft. She does so successfully, and her nightmare comes to an end.
