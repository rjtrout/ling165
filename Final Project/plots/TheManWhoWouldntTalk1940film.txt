A man shoots dead a business leader and confesses to the killing, but refuses to say anything more than providing the name Joe Monday which is obviously an alias. His attorney joins forces with a woman claiming that she is his sister and that he is really a soldier reported missing during World War I. Still the accused refuses to offer further information. He is tried for murder with the case seemingly hanging on events from over twenty years earlier when the dead man and the accused had served in the same infantry company in France.
