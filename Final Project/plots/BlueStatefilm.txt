John Logue (Breckin Meyer), a dedicated John Kerry campaigner in the 2004 election, actually follows through on a drunken campaign vow to move to Canada if George W. Bush would be re-elected. When Bush indeed wins again, John finds his employer and his friends took his public vow seriously and he can not help but stay true to his word. He meets Chloe Hamon (Anna Paquin), a reader of his blog, who wants to accompany him to Canada. On his way, they visit Johns parents who are upset about his liberal views because his father (Richard Blackburn) is an inveterate Republican supporter. Moreover, Johns brother is a soldier who fought in the Iraq War. Later, close to the Canadaâ€“United States border, Chloe reveals to John that she is a deserter who was in Iraq as a soldier and is supposed to return there. John insists on taking Chloe to Canada although he then risks getting in trouble should she get arrested. In Canada, they are welcomed by a community of American expatriates but neither John nor Chloe really fit in there, despite the arrangement of a marriage to allow John to remain. Making a difficult decision to return, John and Chloe head for the border and an uncertain fate. When Chloe is arrested and has to go to prison, John waits for her, and in his return to the United States, has made a determination that he must make a difference. "Logue for State Senate" is the bumper sticker on his car.
