Republican newspaper magnate Kay Thorndyke (Angela Lansbury) intends to make her lover, aircraft tycoon Grant Matthews (Spencer Tracy), president with her as the power behind the throne. Thorndyke plans to use her newspaper chains influence to deadlock the 1948 Republican National Convention, so it will choose Matthews as a compromise dark horse candidate instead of Thomas E. Dewey, Robert A. Taft, or former Governor of Minnesota, Harold Stassen. Matthews is skeptical of the idea of running for president, but Thorndyke, Republican strategist Jim Conover (Adolphe Menjou), and campaign manager Spike McManus (Van Johnson) persuade him to run. Matthews reunites with his estranged wife, Mary (Katharine Hepburn), for the campaign. Despite knowing about Thorndyke and her husbands affair, Mary agrees to support him in public because of his idealism and honesty, and because she is unaware of Thorndykes role in the campaign. The politically na√Øve Matthews makes a controversial speech in Wichita, denouncing big labor. Before he makes another controversial speech in Detroit denouncing big business, Thorndyke secretly persuades him to moderate his tone to help his chances for the nomination. With her and Conovers help, Matthews makes deals with various special interests for their support. At a nationwide fireside chat from the Matthews home, Mary learns of Thorndykes continuing relationship with her husband and discovers the deals that he has made. Matthews realizes that he has betrayed his and Marys ideals. While promising to seek bipartisan reform, he denounces as frauds both his backers and himself on live radio, and withdraws as a candidate. Matthews also asks for his wifes forgiveness.
