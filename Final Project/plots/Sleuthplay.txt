The play is set in the Wiltshire manor house of Andrew Wyke, an immensely successful mystery writer. Wykes home reflects his obsession with the inventions and deceptions of fiction and his fascination with games and game-playing. He lures his wifes lover Milo Tindle, to the house and convinces him to stage a robbery of her jewelry, a proposal that sets off a chain of events that leaves the audience trying to decipher where Wykes imagination ends and reality begins. Shaffer said the play was partially inspired by one of his friends, composer Stephen Sondheim, whose intense interest in game-playing is mirrored by the character of Wyke.
