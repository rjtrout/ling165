A nobody, comic Kip Cooper does his act on stage in Asbury Park, New Jersey to more snores than roars. He asks out one of the performing Washburn sisters for a date, and finds that Fays parents once did a vaudeville act that Kip still knows by heart. Kip convinces Fay to do the old act themselves. But when hes offered a solo engagement, Kip grabs it, only to flop and be cheated out of his pay. He takes a small part in a show, lying to the Washburns that he was hired to be the lead, and does an impromptu gag that gets him fired. Fay needs a job, so she joins the chorus of old-time comedian Eddie Eagens touring show. Kip takes a bit too much interest in Eddies beautiful and much younger wife, Nancy, who co-stars in the revue. Kip ends up going on for Eddie during an illness, and then becomes his replacement. Eddie attempts a comeback when the show gets to New York, but collapses on stage. Kips career takes off after that, but what he wants most is for Fay to take him back.
