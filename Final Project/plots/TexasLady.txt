On a riverboat, gambler Chris Mooney loses heavily to Prudence Webb, borrows another $30,000 and loses that to her, too. He offers her a partnership. Prudence declines, informing him that her father embezzled funds to gamble with Chris, then committed suicide after he lost. Prudence has her revenge and the money to pay back her late fathers employer. She rides to Fort Ralston, Texas to claim her inheritance, the Clarion newspaper, which her dad won in a card game. Stringer Winfield, the postal carrier, warns her that town founder Micah Ralston and ranch partner Sturdy own practically everything and everybody. Clarion editor Clay Ballard tries to get Prudences ownership overturned, but drunken lawyer Cass Gower sobers up and wins her case, even though Judge Herzog is in Ralstons pocket. A hired gun, Jess Foley, acting as a "deputy," kills Gantz, a rival rancher. Foley then makes a play for Prudence, asking her to dance and to teach him to read. Chris shows up. Foley objects to his romantic interest in Prudence, who warns Chris to beware of Foleys jealousy and gun. Chris manages to hold off Foley, who also has Gantzs widow after him. The crooked sheriff, Herndon, on orders from Ralston, gives 24-hour notice to Prudence to repay $6,000 in back taxes or forfeit her property. Prudence concedes defeat and intends to ride out of town with Chris, who gambled and failed to raise the money. Her new neighbors collect the $6,000 on her behalf, also naming Chris as the new mayor, Cass as the new judge and saloon owner Moore as the new sheriff. Stringer rides for the Texas Rangers as soon as Ralstons men come with guns blazing, Cass getting killed. Law and order arrive in town, with Ralston & Sturdy finally relenting.
