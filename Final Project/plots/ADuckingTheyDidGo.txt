The Stooges are once again unemployed. After an unsuccessful attempt to steal a watermelon from a deliveryman (Cy Schindell), which lands them in trouble with a cop (William Irving), the boys wind up at the offices of the Canvas Back Duck Club. The club, run by conmen Blackie (Lynton Brent) and Doyle (Wheaton Chambers) needs some salesmen and the trio have no trouble getting the job because, unbeknownst to them, the whole thing is a scam. Dressed in duck-hunting gear, Larry, Moe and Curly invade the police station and barge right into the office of the police chief (Bud Jamison). The Stooges somehow convince him, the mayor, and the entire police department to join up. Once the stooges informed the conmen about the sale and who they sold them to, the conmen took the money and leave knowing that theyll get caught. By the time the group arrives at the lodge, the "club owners" are long gone, and an old man assures them that there are no ducks to be found. In a panic, Moe and Larry try to solve this dilemma by hurling decoy ducks and rubber decoys over the pond. Curly arrives at last with a large flock of ducks (Ã  la the Pied Piper of Hamelin) and leads them into the water. Eventually, the old man shows up (with the sheriff) ranting that Curly has stolen his prize domestic ducks, worth $5 apiece. The cops realize they have been swindled and point their guns at the Stooges, who flee the scene.
