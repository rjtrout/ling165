Caroline Bender (Lange) is an ambitious young secretary in a publishing firm who, when jilted, finds consolation in the arms of editor Mike Rice (Boyd). Gregg Adams (Parker) is a typist and an aspiring actress romantically involved with stage director David Savage (Jourdan). When the director dumps her, she is devastated, falls from a fire escape on which she used to lurk outside his apartment, and dies. April Morrison (Baker) winds up pregnant, and jumps from a car when her unborn infants father, Dexter Key (Evans), refuses to marry her and urges an abortion. All three women are under the supervision of editor Amanda Farrow (Crawford), an exacting professional and a frustrated woman who marries, leaves the firm, and returns when she finds the simple life of home and marriage not to her liking.
