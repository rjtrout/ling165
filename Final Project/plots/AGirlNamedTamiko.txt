Ivan Kalin (Laurence Harvey) is a Eurasian photographer who is trapped in Japan, but who wants to emigrate to the United States. His visa is continually delayed, which causes him to use his charm with women to pull some strings and apply some pressure on the embassy. His romantic magnetism works on a thrill-seeking American (Martha Hyer) and an aristocratic Japanese woman (France Nuyen).
