The story is set in the Deep South, where a diabolical, machete-wielding voodoo priest (Tony Todd) is busily turning Haitian migrant farm workers into flesh-eating, zombie slaves. However, his plans are disrupted by the arrival of two college students searching for a missing colleague who turns out to have been one of the priests earlier zombie experiments.
