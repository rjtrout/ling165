Hearing the news from the Merry Men that Robin Hood has been captured, and is sure to hang, Jerry and Nibbles decide to go and free Robin, who is imprisoned in the dungeons of Notthingham Castle, with Tom as guard. They break into the dungeon and find the cell where "poor old Robin is locked up tight, e is", but first they have to get past Tom, who guards the "bloomin key".. They find the "bloomin key" and grab it off Tom, but Tom locks Jerry and Nibbles in the cellar and swallows the key. Jerry and Nibbles escape the cellar, and Nibbles is able to get the key for Robin Hoods cell by abseiling from a piece of string, into Toms mouth, whilst Tom is asleep. However, the string breaks, and Tom swallows Nibbles, waking him up in the process. Hiccuping, Tom drinks down a great deal of red wine, and then he goes back to sleep. Nibbles emerges from Toms mouth, clearly inebriated and singing "The Bonnie Banks o Loch Lomond". He almost escapes, but the prongs of the key get caught on Toms mouth and he wakes up again. Tom closes his mouth, trapping Nibbles. "Blimey! E locked me in, e did!". Nibbles breaks through Toms teeth, using the key as a battering-ram. Jerry helps Nibbles escape Tom, and together they give the key to Robin Hood. However, Tom raises the alarm. A silhouette of Robin Hood is seen diving into the moat around the castle and he escapes, with arrows flying all around him. Jerry and Nibbles celebrate Robins freedom, but Nibbless diaper gets caught on a flying arrow and he is sent into a nearby tree. A still-inebriated Nibbles is carousing, whilst being carried on the arrow-shaft by Jerry.
