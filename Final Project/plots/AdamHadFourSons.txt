Adam Stoddard (Warner Baxter) is a wealthy, easy-going family patriarch who falls on hard times after the death of his wife Molly (Fay Wray) and a stock market crash in 1907 that wipes out his wealth. Recently arrived governess Emilie (Ingrid Bergman) works to keep the family together. But with the loss of Adams fortune, the boys are sent off to boarding school, their schooling paid for by wealthy, aged Cousin Phillipa (Helen Westley). Emilie must return to France until Adam can afford to repurchase the family estate and recall her to look after it. Reversing his fortunes takes Adam several years. By then, the three older boys are fighting in World War I. Then, just as the family is getting back to its former way of life... One son, David (Johnny Downs) returns with his new wife, Hester (Susan Hayward), who turns out be a conniving, evil woman wanting to rule the roost. Cousin Phillipa figures out the false Hester, dying before she can tell Adam. Hester schemes to rid the home of Emilie, and seduces another son, Jack (Richard Denning), while her husband is away at war. Emilie discovers the affair, but keeps quiet to preserve Adams happiness and the brothers reputation, pretending to Adam that she was the one involved with Jack. Later, when David returns, Hester inadvertently exclaims "Oh, Jack" while David is caressing her. Realizing her infidelity, David leaves to commit suicide by flying a plane and crashing on a stormy night. Yet, he is hospitalized and survives. Ultimately, all is discovered, and Hester receives her comeuppance and is evicted from the home. Emilie and Adam become engaged, and all ends happily. (The youngest brother, Phillip, is involved with their neighbor, Vance.)
