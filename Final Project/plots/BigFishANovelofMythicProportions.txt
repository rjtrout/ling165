A young man (William Bloom), at the deathbed of his father (Edward Bloom), tries to reconcile his memories of his dad with the person he really is. Whereas he always saw his father as an irresponsible liar, he comes to understand his dads exaggerations and their roots in reality. The book is written in a chronological (although they may not appear so at first) series of tall tales. Despite the novels first-person narration, there is no present tense part of the book. The various stories are Wills retelling of tales that Edward has told about his life. The My Fathers Death Take chapters are William planning out his final conversation with his father in his head and how it will go, so that when the actual conversation takes place, he will be able to get to bottom of the truth and of truly understanding his father. The book draws elements from the epic poem the Odyssey, James Joyces Ulysses, and American tall tales. The story of Edward Bloom also includes a few events based on the Twelve Labors of Hercules.
