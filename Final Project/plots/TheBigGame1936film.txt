Clark Jenkins is the star quarterback of Atlantics college football team. He falls in love with classmate Margaret Anthony, whose father, Brad, is a newspaper sports columnist who disapproves of their romance. A gambler and school booster, George Scott, has been discreetly giving money to Clark, as he has in the past for players like Pop, who couldnt have afforded to go to college otherwise. Clarks roommate and teammate, Cal Calhoun, snitches on him to Brad Anthony, who investigates and falsely concludes that Clark intends to deliberately lose a game for a payoff from gambling kingpin Blackie Dawson. No such arrangement exists. But with the big game against Erie coming up, Blackie kidnaps Clark to make sure Atlantic cant win. Pop creates a distraction on the field to delay the proceedings while Margaret, George and an apologetic Cal rush to rescue Clark in time to play in the game.
