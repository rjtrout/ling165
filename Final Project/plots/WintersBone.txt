Seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly looks after her mentally ill mother, twelve-year-old brother Sonny and six-year-old sister Ashlee in the rural Ozarks of Missouri. She makes sure her siblings eat and teaches them basic survival skills like hunting and cooking. The family is destitute. Rees father, Jessup, has not been home for a long time; his whereabouts are unknown. He is out on bail following an arrest for manufacturing "crank". Sheriff Baskin tells Ree that if her father does not appear for his court date, they will lose the house because it was put up as part of his bond. Ree sets out to find her father. She starts with her meth-addicted uncle Teardrop and continues to more distant kin, eventually trying to talk to the local crime boss, Thump Milton. Milton refuses to see her; the only information Ree comes up with are warnings to leave the situation alone and stories that Jessup died in a meth lab fire or skipped town to avoid the trial. When Jessup fails to appear for the trial, the bondsman comes looking for him and tells Ree that she has about a week before the house and land are seized. Ree tells him that Jessup must be dead, because "Dollys dont run." He tells her that she must provide proof that her father is dead to avoid the bond being forfeited. Ree tries to go see Milton again and is severely beaten by the women of his family. Teardrop shows up and rescues Ree, promising her attackers that she will not say anything or cause more trouble. Teardrop tells Ree that her father was killed because he was going to inform on other meth cookers, but he does not know who killed him. He warns her that if she ever finds out who did, she must not tell him, as the killer will likely kill him as well. A few nights later, the same Milton women who beat Ree come to her house and offer to take her to "[her] daddys bones." The women place a burlap sack on her head and drive her to a pond, where they row to the shallow area where her fathers submerged body lies. They tell Ree to reach into the water and grasp her fathers hands so they can cut them off with a chainsaw; the severed arms will serve as proof of death for the authorities. Ree takes the hands to the sheriff, telling him that someone flung them onto the porch of her house. The bondsman gives Ree the cash portion of the bond, which was put up by an anonymous associate of Jessup. Ree tries to give Jessups banjo to Teardrop, but he tells her to keep it at the house for him. As he is leaving, he tells her that he now knows who killed her father. Ree reassures Sonny and Ashlee that she will never leave them. As the three of them are sitting on the stairs of the porch, Ashlee goes and gets the banjo and starts to play - showing a natural affinity for it.
