People Will Talk describes an episode in the life of Dr. Noah Praetorius (Cary Grant), a physician who teaches in a medical school and founded a clinic dedicated to treating patients humanely and holistically. The plot contains two parallel story lines: a professional-misconduct challenge brought against Praetorius by his more conventional colleague Dr. Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn), who dislikes Praetoriuss unorthodox but effective methods; and the struggle of a distressed young woman named Deborah Higgins (Jeanne Crain), who falls in love with Praetorius while dealing with an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. The film also highlights Praetoriuss close friend and confidant, physics professor Lyonel Barker (Walter Slezak), who plays bass viol in the student/faculty orchestra conducted by Praetorius.
