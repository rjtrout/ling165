Kansas settler Jeptha Marr is leery of the railroad intruding on his territory and opposes railroad representative Stephen Bent, only to be surprised when daughter Vinnie returns to the town of Pawnee after a long absence and is already acquainted with Stephen. A rival railroad interest spearheaded by Champ Clanton tries to muscle its way in, trying to taint Stephens reputation by insinuating a relationship with Rita Molyneaux, a woman with a bad reputation. By the end, though, Vinnie is reassured that Rita is actually interested in Gideon Skene, and the railroad is headed Pawnees way under Stephens watch.
