Doctor Dr√© and Ed Lover are two bumbling barbers at a Harlem barbershop. Knowing full well that cutting hair is not their calling, their boss, friend, and mentor Nick (Jim Moody) tells the two maybe they should try out for the police academy. They refuse at first, but Nick threatens them with unemployment. Crazily enough, it works out for the two, and they are accepted on the New York City police force. Things seem to be going well for them, when tragedy suddenly strikes, and they lose Nick. Now enforcers of the law, the tag team decides to investigate the incident, which they believe to be a murder. Ed and Dre find out through the streets that a crooked land developer named Demetrius (Richard Bright) might have had something to do with their friends death, and proceed to attempt to dig up as much dirt on him as possible. This proves to be difficult, however, when theyve got a nutty Sergeant (Denis Leary), a moody detective (Rozwill Young), and a bunch of unwilling street hoods (Guru, Ice-T) to go through to get the information they need. Though there arent any certain clues to be found, strange happenings are certainly going on, as the cops found out that Demetrius company seems to be looking for oil rather than looking for property. With their superiors not believing Ed And Dres story and getting themselves in trouble,they end up being suspended. However, they get a lead to a warehouse where they find a lot of guns. They have enough evidence to arrest Demetrius at the fashion show, but Demetrius didnt kill Nick. It was revealed that Nicks friend, Lionel, was working for Demetrius and murdered him. Ed and Dre are offered their jobs back, but decided to quit stating its too violent for them. When they return to their old barbershop they discovered oil coming from the floor. Soon after, theyre back in business re-opening the place giving customers bad haircuts.
