Lee Preston, aka Leland Bruce (Lowery), kills a man in self-defense but flees to the redwood country when the law makes it a murder charge. There he meets Lynn OMalley (Gilbert), the niece of "Sandy" McTavish (Farnum) who runs the trading post. Lee learns why this is good trapping country as the timber barons across the lake are ruthlessly cutting the trees and driving the animals across the river. The trappers appeal to him to take a petition to the Governor which would prohibit the timber people from coming to their side of the lake. At first, because he is a wanted man, he refuses, but does so later for the sake of the people, even though he knows it will lead to his arrest.
