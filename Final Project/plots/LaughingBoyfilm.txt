Slim Girl is an Indian maiden raised by whites, who call her "Lily." Many members of the Navajo tribe shun her, believing Slim Girl to be leading an improper life, perhaps even as a prostitute. A silversmith, Laughing Boy, is seduced by her. After losing a horse race, he challenges rival Red Man to a wrestling match and wins. This impresses Slim Girl, who expresses her desire for him. She returns to her previous intimate relationship, however, with George Hartshone, a rich rancher. One day, Slim Girl seeks out Laughing Boy, becomes his lover and persuades him to marry her. But when she goes to town to sell his silver goods, Laughing Boy follows and finds her in Hartshones arms. He aims a bow and arrow at Hartshone, but ends up killing Slim Girl instead.
