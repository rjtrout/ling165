A trapper, Pierre Esprit Radisson, and his friend, nicknamed "Gooseberry," hope to open a trading post in the Hudsons Bay region of northeastern Canada in the year 1667. They meet the jailed Lord Edward Crewe, a nobleman from England who has been banished from that country by King Charles II. They manage to free Edward, who funds their expedition, beginning in Montreal, designed to further free trade with the Indians and make Canada a more united land. Barbara Hall is the sweetheart of Edward and her brother, Gerald, is thrust upon them after the explorers travel to England to seek the kings favor. Prince Rupert helps get Edward back in the kings good graces. Charles II is open to the idea of a trading post, provided he is personally brought 400,000 pelts. Gerald creates trouble in Canada as soon as the new Fort Charles trading post is established. His actions incite violence among the Indian natives, who demand he be punished. Over the kings objections and to Barbaras horror, Radisson and his associates permit Gerald to be sentenced to death by a firing squad. But once the gravity of her brothers misdeeds become clear to her, and with the flourishing of the Hudsons Bay trading post, Barbara forgives her love Edward while his partners Radisson and Gooseberry celebrate their success.
