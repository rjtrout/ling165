A Baker (James Corden) and his Wife (Emily Blunt) wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the Bakers family by a Witch (Meryl Streep) who found the Bakers father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. Because the Bakers father also stole some beans, the Witch was punished with the curse of ugliness by her own mother. The Witch offers to lift the curse, but only if the Baker and his Wife obtain four critical items for her: a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, a hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold. The Witch later tells the Baker that she asked him to do this task for her because she is not allowed to touch any of the objects. The Witchs demands eventually bring the Baker and his Wife into contact with Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the Baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the Witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), whose ruby cape the couple notices when she stops to buy sweets on her way to grandmothers house; with Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy), whose tower the Bakers Wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), who also runs into the Bakers Wife while fleeing from the pursuing Prince (Chris Pine). After a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the Baker and his Wife finally are able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receive their "happy endings": Cinderella marries the Prince; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the Giant in the sky, and kills the pursuing Giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother are saved from the Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp); and the Witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion. However, each of the characters learns their "happily ever after" is not very happy: the Baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the Bakers Wife is temporarily seduced by the Prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by the cheating Prince; and the Witch learns that she has lost her powers with her restored youth and beauty. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the Giants Wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hoods Mother and Grandmother, Jacks Mother, and the Bakers Wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that lead to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the Witch for raising the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept responsibility for their individual actions. Casting all her remaining beans away, she begs her mother to punish her again and disappears into a large pit of boiling tar. The remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening Giants Wife, though Cinderella and the Baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the Giants Wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. With The Giants Wife dead, the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The Baker, thinking of his Wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the Prince and help the Baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the Baker and Cinderella. The Baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling a story as the movie ends with the Witchs moral, meaning that children can change due to the parents actions and behaviors.
