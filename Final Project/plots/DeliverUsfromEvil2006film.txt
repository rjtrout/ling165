The film chronicles OGradys years as a priest in Northern California, where he committed his crimes. After being convicted of child molestation and serving seven years in prison, OGrady was deported to his native Ireland. Berg interviewed him there in 2005 for the film. Additionally, the film presents trial documents, videotaped depositions, and interviews with activists, theologians, psychologists, and lawyers; it suggests that Church officials were aware of OGradys crimes, and they took steps to conceal them to protect him and the church.
