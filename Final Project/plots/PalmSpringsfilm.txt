Unaware of this is daughter Joan, who is in finishing school but has gambling issues of her own, getting expelled after being caught doing exactly that. Identifying himself as Captain Smith, the earl travels to Palm Springs, California. In time his daughter pursues him there, and is surprised when a wealthy man named George Brittel at a casino identifies the man as a cheat, unaware that "Captain Smith" is the girls father. Joan decides to land a rich husband. Believing her to be Lady Sylvia, daughter of the earl, Brittel is immediately interested. So is a cowboy called Slim, who even gives Joan a horse. Aunt Letty invites a British counsel of her acquaintance, Bruce Morgan, to come visit Palm Springs and help sort things out. The earl explains his situation and why he is using a different name. Joan accepts a proposal of marriage from Brittel, who balks when he learns she is not a woman of wealth. Slim takes her back with open arms.
