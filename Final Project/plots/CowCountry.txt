Walts beautiful daughter Linda returns to town after a long absence and Ben still carries a torch for her, but shes now involved with another man, Harry Odell. The cattle business is in trouble. Beef prices have dropped so low, cattle companies are being urged to sell their stock to a rendering plant. Ben tries to intervene, and eventually learns that banker Parker is colluding with Odell and the plants owner, Sledge, to gain control of the ranchers valuable land. Melba Sykes and her father Tim are squatting on Walts ranch. It turns out that Odell is not only hiding his business schemes from Linda but also the fact that hes been romancing Melba behind her back. Tim Sykes is killed, and when Sledge produces a bill of sale from the man, Ben knows its been forged because Tim did not know how to write. Melba boasts to Linda that her lover Odell will look out for her interest now. Linda realizes shes been betrayed and turns to Ben for solace and advice. Melba becomes furious when Odell breaks off their relationship and snaps a bullwhip at him. A showdown ensues in a box canyon, where Parker and Sledge are planning to destroy the cattle they have rustled. Ben gets there in time to shoot them both. He is wounded himself, but will survive and also will now have Linda.
