Following the death of his wife Audrey, John Munn (Dermot Mulroney) moves with his two sons, mid-teen Chris Munn (Jamie Bell) and adolescent Tim Munn (Devon Alan), to a pig farm in rural Drees County, Georgia, where they lead a reclusive life. Chris is the protagonist, a troubled teen rebelling against this life in ways where he is regularly picked up by the police. The story of the film is one of greed and family hatred. It begins when Johns brother Deel (Josh Lucas) visits the Munn family and the two boys did not even know of his existence. Deel wants the hoard of gold coins from John. He eventually finds them hidden behind Johns family portrait. John refuses to give them up. In the ensuing struggle, Deel murders him. He tries to kill Chris and Tim too, but they escape him and run away from home. Chris brings the gold coins along with him. On the run, the boys meet an assortment of fairytale-like characters. Deel pursues them, eventually catching up. Wading into a river, Chris throws away the gold coins into the water. Enraged by their loss, Deel struggles with Chris and tries to drown the boy. In turn, Deel receives a fatal stab wound in the chest. Chris appears to wake up in hospital. There, he is reunited with Tim and their grandparents.
