A former circus performer, Ken Kenton becomes personally involved when a mysterious criminal organization called Black Death appears to be targeting a circus troupe. Ken is reunited with the circus owners daughter, Mary Hiller, and crosses the path of Bargoff, a bronco rider who resents Ken and tries to get him killed in a knife-throwing act. After a Russian baron named Petroff assists him when Bargoff robs the circus and kidnaps Mary, it turns out Petroff is the ringleader of the Black Death. A confrontation leaves Ken and Mary safe to proceed with their lives.
