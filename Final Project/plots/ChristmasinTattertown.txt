A young girl named Debbie, her doll named Miss Muffet and a stuffed dog are sucked into the realm of Tattertown, where discarded items come to life. While the stuffed dog maintains his loyalty to Debbie, Miss Muffet, who has long felt oppressed by the wear and tear of being a childs plaything, quickly runs off and transforms herself into Muffet the Merciless, set on conquering Tattertown by organizing Tattertowns seedier underground figures into an army. Completely oblivious to Muffets intentions, Debbie decides to introduce the concept of Christmas to Tattertown, where it is apparently a foreign notion despite some of the items in Tattertown being an old Christmas wreath and an evergreen tree. Tattertowns residents are consistently unable to grasp the concept of Christmas, and in desperation, Debbie plays the original recording of Bing Crosbys "White Christmas" as Muffet attempts an air raid on Tattertown. The raid fails when Muffets henchmen are distracted by the song, and Muffet lands in jail. While the residents did consider "White Christmas" to be a beautiful song, it is never resolved whether anyone ever grasped the true meaning of Christmas.
