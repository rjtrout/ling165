The action opens upon the musical stave in which Mr. B Natural lives. Mr. B addresses the audience directly, in an effort to appear welcoming, and explains what it means to be a spirit of music. Awaiting a persons call for help, Mr. B evinces sympathy and concern for lonely junior high student Buzz Turner. Buzz shows an interest in music like the more popular kids at school, but is so shy that he makes excuses to not attend a dance, even when a girl directly invites him. Dejected, Buzz returns home and puts on a record. This magically summons Mr. B into the adolescent boys bedroom, whereupon the pixie uses magic, music and dance to convince Buzz to take up playing the trumpet. In visiting the music dealership, Buzzs parents are reassured by the salesman that buying a trumpet is "simply making a small investment in your sons lifetime personality." When Buzz mentions that he didnt care what make his new horn would be, he is upbraided by Mr. B Natural, and is treated to a detailed description of the C. G. Conn factory and laboratories. Through the gift of music and the help of his mysterious friend, Buzz finds the confidence and assertiveness he needs to try out for the school band, impress girls, and play solo at concerts and school dances.
