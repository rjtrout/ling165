Frustrated while having a fling with a married man, fashion model Laura is persuaded to fly in playboy Wally Druckers private plane to a party aboard a yacht. The plane crashes near a small Mediterranean island, where a man named Moore, his daughter Costanza and a couple others seem to be the only people there. Laura is unhurt but Wallys injuries are treated by Moore, a former World War II medic. Moore is vague about his past or why he is living in this solitary fashion. Lauras interest in him makes Drucker jealous and irritates Costanza, who is herself desired by an older man from a nearby island who wishes to marry her. A beached yacht belonging to Moore is found. It turns out he was a wealthy man from North Carolina suspected of murdering his wife, who drunkenly fell from the boat and drowned. Moore gave his millions to charity and dropped out of sight. Moore must fight the other men for Laura, who then persuades him to sail back to America and begin a new life.
