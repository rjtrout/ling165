Lady Patricia (Billie Dove), a London socialite engaged to another aristocrat, shocks her father and social class by marrying the poor Italian violinist Paul Gherardi (Basil Rathbone). Countess Olga Balakireff (Kay Francis), a vamp who likes to fool around with men below her station, takes an interest in Gherardi, as well. Unbeknownst to Patricia, Balakireff uses her influence to make Paul famous and, in return, ensnares him in an affair. The double strain of fame and deceit causes Paul to suffer a collapse at Balakireffs house. Dr. Pomeroy (Kenneth Thompson) is sent for, who happens to be one of Patricias former lovers. He has Paul taken home, where Patricia quickly uncovers the facts. The couple separate. While Dr. Pomeroy ardently courts Patricia, Paul cohabits with Balakireff in the South of France, until she has had her fun and leaves him. Paul then suffers a paralytic attack. Patricia and Dr. Pomeroy take Paul to a surgeon for an operation, and Patricia stays at her husbands side to nurse him back to health. After a month, Paul still seems not to have made any progress and accuses Patricia of wanting to leave him for Thompson. The moment after Thompson and Patricia have said goodbye forever because she wont leave a paralyzed husband, Paul reveals to his wife that he has, in fact, fully recovered, and the two are reconciled.
