The Stooges are choreographers at B. O. Pictures who are assigned to teach island natives how to dance. The studios president, Mr. Baines (Emil Sitka) has purchased the fictional Pacific island of Rarabonga (parody of Rarotonga, one of the Cook Islands) for his next musical extravaganza, but learns that the local natives have never heard of dancing. When the Stooges arrive at Rarabonga, they soon learn that the natives are head hunters under the control of powerful Witch Doctor Varanu (Kenneth MacDonald). Shemp makes it clear he does not want the "hair cuts down to my neck!" and the Stooges try to flee with the help of the Tribe Kings daughter Luana (Jean Willes). She wants them to rescue her boyfriend from the witch doctor, who plans to behead him in the morningâ€”along with the Stooges. In one of the huts, the Three Stooges try to get their hands on a box of surplus World War II hand grenades guarded by a living Kali type four-armed totem idol (Lei Aloha). After getting the daylights beat out of them by the fierce idol, the boys grab the box of grenades, and fool the Witch Doctor into proving his expertise with his sword by slicing the box of grenades with his huge sword, and the grenades promptly explode, blowing him out of the atmosphere. With Witch Doctor Varanu gone, the Stooges commence with their choreography lessons and teach the natives to dance.
