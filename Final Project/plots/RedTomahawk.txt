Mistaken at first for a deserter, Army captain Tom York rides into the town of Deadwood after the Little Big Horn massacre. He has come to warn the townspeople of a likely Sioux attack. Somewhere in the area is hidden a pair of Gatling guns, which would be vital to fending off such an assault. The only person who knows the hiding place is Dakota Lil, a saloonkeeper who already has lost her husband and son in battle and wants no more part of it. Ultimately persuaded by York to reveal where the guns are, they are betrayed by a gambler, Elkins, who intends to sell them to the enemy for a profit. York and others manage to get them back, and once everyone is town is safe, he decides to put down roots there with Dakota Lil.
