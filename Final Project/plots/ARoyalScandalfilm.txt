Catherine discards her latest lover, Variatinsky, the commander of the palace guard. General Ronsky schemes to have his oafish nephew Boris (an uncredited Grady Sutton) be his replacement, so he and his cabal can stage an uprising and dethrone the Czarina. Catherines chancellor, Nicolai Ilyitch, is determined to see to it that nothing disturbs his delicate negotiations for a treaty with France, so he tells his underling Malakoff he does not want anybody new to see her majesty. However, a determined young officer, Alexei Chernoff, insists on an audience with her for the sake of Russia.
