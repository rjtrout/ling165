Party boy Bobby is a mail clerk in a big firm, but he has a trump cardâ€”an executive at the firm he works for, in the person of Waymon, an African-American who is on the verge of making partner in the firm. They make a deal in which Waymon will try to move Bobby to the trainee broker program if he will help him meet Natalie (original party girl), the girl of his dreams. Theres only one problem: Everyone will have to adapt.
