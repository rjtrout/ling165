Tony Rome is an ex-cop turned private investigator who lives on a powerboat in Miami called the Straight Pass. This a reference to the fact that Tony also has a gambling problem. He is asked by his former partner, Ralph Turpin (Robert J. Wilke), to take home a young woman who had been left unconscious in a hotel room. The woman, Diana (n√©e Kosterman) Pines (Sue Lyon), is the daughter of rich construction magnate Rudolph Kosterman (Simon Oakland), who subsequently hires Rome to find out why his daughter is acting so irrationally. After regaining consciousness, Diana discovers a diamond pin, which she had been wearing the night before, has gone missing. Diana and her stepmother Rita (Gena Rowlands) also hire Rome, in this instance, to find the lost pin. Rome is chloroformed and beaten by a pair of thugs, and Turpin is found murdered in Romes office. Lt. Dave Santini (Richard Conte) of the Miami police investigates the crime scene and demands information from Rome, whos an old friend. Preferring to work on his own, Rome gets help from a seductive divorcee, Ann Archer (Jill St. John). An attempt is made on Kostermans life, and a jeweler is found murdered. Rome discovers that Diana has been selling her stepmothers jewels and giving the money to Lorna, her real mother. The trail leads to Ritas dead ex-husband and Adam Boyd, a doctor, who ordered the killings. The case solved, Rome invites Ann for a romantic getaway on his boat, but, she has decided to go back to her husband.
