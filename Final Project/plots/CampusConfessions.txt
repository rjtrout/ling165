Wayne Atterbury, Sr., is president of Middleton College, where he tolerates no foolishness. So when his milquetoast son, Wayne Jr., enrolls as a freshman, the boy makes it clear to newspaper reporter Joyce Gilmore and to every student he meets that school must be all work and no play. This makes him instantly unpopular. Hank Luisetti plays basketball for the school, which has never had a winning team. He is tempted to switch to a different college when Wayne Jr. offers his fathers estate as a training camp. Luisetti is surprised when Wayne turns out to have a knack for the game himself. He becomes a basketball star and Joyce becomes a lot more interested in him. A big game against arch-rival State U is coming up, and Middleton finally has a shot at winning. Hank, however, flunks math, so Dean Wilton needs to suspend him from the team. The stuffed-shirt Atterbury watches his son play basketball and gets so excited about winning, he approves a new math test for Hank while the games in progress. Hank passes, then scores 24 points in the final period to help carry Middleton to victory, whereupon both Atterburys are carried off by the happy crowd.
