Retired matador Antonio Morales is anxious when his wife gives birth, disappointed when the baby turns out to be a girl, then thrilled when a twin brother is born. He names them Mario and Maria. As the children grow up, Antonios wife dreads the idea of her son facing the danger of becoming a bullfighter, particularly inasmuch as Mario has an artistic side to his nature, an affinity for music. Maria, meanwhile, becomes quite expert in the ring, taught by her fathers right-hand man, Chato Vasquez. As a gift on their 21st birthday, Maria honors her brother by getting a copy of Marios new music composition to Maximino Contreras, a famed orchestra conductor. Maximino, thoroughly impressed, pays a call on the Morales family just before Marios first bullfight. Antonio prefers not to distract his son prior to entering the ring, so he promises to pass along Maximinos personal regards later. But he does not. Before a second bullfight, Mario is approached by Maximino, who wonders why he never responded to his previous invitation to meet. Realizing that his father ignored it, Mario angrily walks out of the ring, disappointing spectators and infuriating his father, who feels the familys honor has been disgraced. Maria attempts a ruse, disguising herself as Mario and confronting the bull. Her life is in danger before Mario intervenes, restoring the Morales familys good name. Mario is permitted by his father to pursue a life in music instead.
