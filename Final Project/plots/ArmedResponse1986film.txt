One of the men of a dangerous Yakuza boss known as Tanaka has subtracted a statuette that he had planned to use as a peace offering between local Yakuza and the rival Chinese Tong. It seems that two private investigators were hired for the exchange of bailout money to restore the statue, but their business plan to recover the statue gets worse and Clay Roth is killed. This infuriates the Roth brothers and their father, as all three of them happen to be veterans, as they go off to find the person responsible and get their revenge as well.
