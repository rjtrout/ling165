On Christmas Eve, two married couples are both having a period of difficulty in their relationship. Newlyweds Isabel (Jane Fonda) and George Haverstick (Jim Hutton) (who had met when she was his hospital nurse), are having a problem because George has bouts of sexual performance anxiety and has quit his job without telling her. The second couple, Ralph (Anthony Franciosa) (a former Korean War buddy of George) and Dorothea Baitz (Lois Nettleton), have their problems based on the fact that he married her only for her moneyâ€”and she knows it, and he dislikes her wealthy parents. The couples individually counsel each other about their insecurities, problems, and plans, while drinking in the Tennessee home of one of them.
