Rosa Lynn, an elderly woman, sends her daughter Loretta and her children to live with her brother-in-law in Mississippi. Loretta is an addict and does not want to go, especially since uncle Earl lives in the dry and rural part of Mississippi. Uncle Earl already has his hands full with his business and a wife who suffers from Alzheimers disease. He has Loretta help him in his restaurant, and the family begins to find strength in their roots, and start to rebuild their lives. An important recurring object throughout the film is a silver candelabra, a family heirloom. The candelabra, which everyone refers to as "Nathan," has strong significance to the family. It is finally revealed that Lorettas great-great grandfather and Jesses father was a slave named Nathan, and he was traded for the candelabra. Jesse stole back the candelabra, and it has been passed through the generations, along with Nathans story, ever since.
