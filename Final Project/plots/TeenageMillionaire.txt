Bobby Schultz goes to live with his Aunt Theodora and her butler-bodyguard Rocky following the sudden deaths of his parents. At a radio station she owns, Bobby takes a job and meets a girl, Bambi, who circulates a new record on which Bobby is a vocalist. As the song catches on and Bobbys reputation grows, Theodora decides it is not to the boys benefit and decides to sell the radio station. Bobby is then drafted into the Army, saying goodbye to all at a farewell party in his honor.
