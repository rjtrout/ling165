A humane zoologist, Dr. Jim Hanlon, who deplores the poaching of African rhinoceros, is unaware that the man he is guiding on safari, Alec Burnett, is a hunter intending to capture two rare white rhino to sell. Edith Arleigh is a nurse romantically involved with Burnett, whose hardened attitude toward jungle life softens when he is bitten by a cobra and Hanlon has to save his life.
