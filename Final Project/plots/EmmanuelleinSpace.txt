The series starred Krista Allen as Emmanuelle, a hedonistic young woman who finds herself teaching the ways of sexuality to a group of aliens who land on Earth, and Paul Michael Robinson as an alien space captain. The story follows an extraterrestrial space crew that finds Emmanuelle on Earth and enlists her help to understand human love and sexuality. As in the case with the other Emmanuelle films, Emmanuelle in Space contains much nudity and sexual content. Today, the various episodes of Emmanuelle in Space are generally available edited together into feature-length productions on DVD and occasionally show up on broadcasters such as Cinemax and cable networks outside the U.S.
