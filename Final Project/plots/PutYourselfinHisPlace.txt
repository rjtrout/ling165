The story is of an English manufacturing town {Huddersfield} in which Henry Little, a worker and inventor, is persecuted by trade unions, jealous because he was better trained than his fellows. Squire Raby, Littles uncle, is a forcible character, and a pleasant love story offsets the labor troubles. A purpose of the novel was to expose, without censure, the errors of early trades unions.
