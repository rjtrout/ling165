Bob Ho is a CIA undercover agent who decides to retire after putting Russian terrorist Anton Poldark behind bars, and marry his longtime girlfriend Gillian, who lives next door and has three children from previous relationships, Farren (a step-daughter), Ian and Nora. None of them know about his job. One day, Gillian leaves to visit her father in a hospital in Denver, Colorado and leaves Bob to take care of her children, who all despise him and plot to get rid of him. Using some technology from the CIA, Bob is able to get control of them. His partner, Colton James, informs him that Poldark has escaped prison and they suspect there is a mole in the CIA. James sends a file to Bobs computer for a top secret formula for an oil-eating bacteria Poldark is working on. While snooping around Bobs house, Ian downloads the file, which he mistakes for music, onto his iPod. Poldark discovers the download and sends some of his people to Bobs house, but Bob overpowers them. After the attack, Bob and his children hide at a Chinese restaurant, where Poldarks teenage henchman, Larry, tries to kill Bob. Bob defeats him and is forced to tell the children about his job. His boss Glaze then arrives, points a gun at him and demands the downloaded file, revealing himself as the mole working for Poldark. Bob knocks out Glaze with Noras turtle, then hides in a hotel with the children. He tells Gillian over the phone about his job. Fearing for her childrens safety, she flies home to take them and breaks up with him. Bob heads to an abandoned factory to confront the Russian terrorists, but finds that Ian, wanting to become a spy, and Farren have run away from home. The trio are captured by the Russians, who force Ian to reveal that the file is on his iPod. As Poldark, his partner Tatiana, and Glaze go to Gillians house. Bob and the children escape and defeat the remaining terrorists. They then go to Gillians house and Poldack and his crew arrive soon after. Bob and the terrorists fight, with the children using Bobs secret weapons to defeat some of them. Soon after, Colton and his crew arrive to arrest the Russians and Glaze. Gillian initially rejects Bob, but soon realizes he is a good man after Nora says she wants him to be her father and Farren and Ian confess that Bob lied to protect them. Bob and Gillian then get married.
