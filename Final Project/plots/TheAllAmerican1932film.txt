College football hero Gary Kings life changes for the worse when the allure of money results in a business arrangement with untrustworthy Willie Walsh and a romance with heiress Gloria Neuchard, changing all his previous plans. Gary spurns sweetheart Ellen Steffens and puts off a promise to best friend Steve Kelly to launch a construction business together. His lavish spending on Gloria and gambling habit result in Gary falling deeply in debt. In the meantime, Garys younger brother Bob has become an All-American football star. Bob is married to Betty Poe and all is well until wealthy Gloria and scheming Willie turn up again. When a football game is scheduled between Bobs school and a team of older All-Stars, an opportunity arises for Gary to play against his brother and teach him not to make the same mistakes he did.
