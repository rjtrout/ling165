Larry Bordens career as a concert pianist ended when a dispute with wealthy father-in-law Harvey Carr ended up with his hand chopped by an ax. Carr is found dead from a blow by an axe and Larry is sure to be the prime suspect. He hires a detective, Sam Campbell and secretary-partner Robbie Vance arrive from New York to help. Harveys daughter and Larrys ex-wife, Irene, also turns up, as does another dead body, the estates handyman. Irene is now engaged to Paul Goff, a singer, who has an agent, Ann Marlow. A theory develops that Carrs death involved a wartime spy ring and a chemical plant he owned, and Goff is implicated. Goff is the next murder victim, though. Sam and Robbie eventually deduce that Ann is the actual spy. They solve the case and save Larry, freeing them to return to New York.
