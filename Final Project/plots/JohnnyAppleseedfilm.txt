In 1806, Pittsburgh farmer Johnny Appleseed watches as pioneers depart out west and wishes he could follow. Johnny is inspired by an angel to abandon his farm, go west, and plant apple seeds everywhere he goes. The angel tells Johnny that he has all that he needs to go out West: a bag of seeds to plant, a Bible, and a pot that he can use for a hat. In his travels, Johnny befriends a skunk, and thereafter, all animals instinctively trust him. As Johnny travels, he uses his pot to fry in, and sings a tune "The lordâ€™s been good to me." In the end, after walking hundreds of miles and planting apple trees all along the way, Johnny finally rests for the last time under a tree; his angel appears before him, and tells Johnny that its time to go. Johnny gets up, scared at first upon realizing hes dead, but refuses to go to his final resting place, believing that his work is not done yet. However, the angel tells him that, where theyre headed, theyre low on apple trees, so Johnny picks up his seed bag and happily agrees to go with him.
