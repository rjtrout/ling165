Arthur Sherwood (Casserly), editor-in-chief of The Evening Times, stumbles upon a nudist camp and smells a good story. He assigns girl reporter Stacy Taylor (Decker) to join the camp so she can write an expose on the nudists indecent lifestyle. Stacy becomes convinced of the sincerity of the nudist philosophy, however, and refuses to write a negative report. Sherwood joins the camp to complete the project, only to decide for himself that nudism is happy and wholesome.
