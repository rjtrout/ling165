A couple of tourists, Harvey and Zoey, discover a lost scroll from the Book of Herschel, evidently someone who received commandments from God, only to have Moses take all the credit. When Herschel confronts God about not being with him when he really needed the help, God evades the accusation, saying he was with him, leaving it unstated that he didnt in fact help him in his time of need.
Wholly Moses
