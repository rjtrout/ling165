The film tells the story of the high-school graduate Bobby, who buys a customized 1976 Dodge D300 Tradesman van (including a waterbed), with his college savings, in order to use it to pick up women. Bobbys desperate quest to have sex leads him into a number of disappointing experiences. His ultimate goal is to win over Sally, the blonde bombshell girlfriend of his arch nemesis Dugan. Dugan is a burly, tough, and heavily tattooed neighborhood bully who seems determined to have the fastest van in town.
