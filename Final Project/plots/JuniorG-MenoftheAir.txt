Japanese saboteurs attack the US in preparation for an invasion during World War II. They are discovered by "Ace" Holden and The Dead End Kids, who do not trust the police enough to help the government. To overcome this, the "Junior G-Men" (the Little Tough Guys) are sent by the FBI to stop the spies.
