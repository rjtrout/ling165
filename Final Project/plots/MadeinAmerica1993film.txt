Zora Matthews (Long), whose mother Sarah (Goldberg) conceived her with the aid of an anonymous sperm donor, discovers her father is a white man named Hal Jackson (Danson). This comes as a major shock to Sarah, who had explicitly requested a black donor. On top of that, Jackson is a loud, self-promoting car salesman, which clashes with Sarahs intellectualism. The film revolves around Zora and her mothers rocky relationship with Jackson. Jackson eventually comes to have feelings for his daughter and her mother.
