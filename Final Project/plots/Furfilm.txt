The cinematic Arbus (Nicole Kidman) is torn between a bizarre relationship with a neighbor who has hypertrichosis, Lionel Sweeney (Robert Downey Jr.), and a conventional life with her husband Allan Arbus (Ty Burrell). An incident with a clogged drain leads her to a relationship with Lionel and entry into a netherworld populated by transvestites, dwarves and others living on the fringes of society. Gradually she is attracted more and more to Lionel and this new, strange and exciting world. When Lionel explains that he suffers from a problem with his lungs and will die soon he asks Diane to shave his entire body clean. They have sex soon afterwards. At the beach, where Lionel always wanted to go for once in his life, both go out for a swim, but Lionel decides to commit suicide by staying under. Diane, touched by her experience with Lionel, now knows what direction to take with her life and career. The final scene shows her at a nudist camp, where she meets a woman who assumes she wants to take her picture. Arbus admits this, but says she wants to get to know this woman better first. The woman replies that she wants to get to know Diane better too, so Diane decides to tell her story, whereupon the movie ends.
