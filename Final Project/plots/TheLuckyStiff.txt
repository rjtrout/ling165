Lawyer John Malone (Donlevy) is an ardent admirer of the sultry night-club singer Anna Marie St. Clair (Lamour). After meeting her at the club, he is present when her boss is killed, and she is arrested for the crime. Anna Marie is sentenced to death, so Malone and his secretary Maggie Seaton (Trevor) set out to find the real murderer, who is probably also responsible for a protection racket Malone is investigating. At the last possible moment, Anna Marie is saved from execution. When she learns that the newspapers have reported that she is dead, she decides to use her status as a "corpse" to her advantage. Millie Dale, her replacement at the nightclub, is also killed. Malone concludes that nightclub owner Eddie Britt has been behind the scheme all along but that Anna Marie, in love with Britt, was also complicit. Police inspector Von Flanagan ends up placing Anna Marie back under arrest, while Malone places a kiss on Maggie.
