The film opens with Costa-Gavras statement that the events of the film are true. At first, When Ed Horman arrives in the unnamed Latin American country, which is clearly meant to be Chile, where his son Charles worked, Ed blames his sons and daughter-in-laws radical political views for his disappearance. He is later crushed when discovering that the government he reveres so highly has been involved with Charless disappearance and possible death as a witness in the killings by the Pinochet Junta, aided by the American government. He finds that his son was sincere about his politics but terrified of violence, and that the U.S. had many interests in the country that have been enhanced by the coup and its aftermath. One U.S. diplomat is polite and friendly but constantly lies to him; a high-ranking American military attache is blunter and basically tells Ed that whatever happened to Charles was his own fault, noting "You play with fire, you get burned." When Ed receives proof that Charles was murdered by the junta and that the U.S. let it happen, he tells the diplomat that hes going to file a lawsuit and see that hes put in jail for his evil deeds. As a bookend of sorts to Costa-Gavras assertion that the events of Missing are true, the film ends with a postscript stating that after his return to the United States, Ed received the body of his son Charles seven months later, making an autopsy impossible, and that a subsequent lawsuit against the US government was dismissed. It also adds that the State Department denies their involvement in the Pinochet coup, a position maintained to the present day.
