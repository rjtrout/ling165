After England and Spain make peace, notorious pirate Henry Morgan (Laird Cregar) decides to reform. As a reward, he is made Governor of Jamaica, with a mandate to rid the Caribbean of his former comrades, by persuasion or force if necessary. He replaces the former governor, Lord Denby (George Zucco), but is not trusted by either the lawful residents or the pirates. Captain Jamie Waring (Tyrone Power) and his lieutenant, Tom Blue (Thomas Mitchell), reluctantly give up their "trade" out of friendship for Morgan, but others of the Pirate Brotherhood, such as Captain Billy Leech (George Sanders) and Wogan (Anthony Quinn), refuse to change. Meanwhile, Waring takes a liking to Denbys daughter, Lady Margaret (Maureen OHara), who happens to be inconveniently engaged to an English gentleman, Roger Ingram (Edward Ashley). As it turns out, her fianc√© is secretly providing information about ship sailings to the unrepentant pirates. Morgan sends Jamie to track down Leech but fails due to Ingrams help. The Jamaican assembly votes to impeach Morgan, and Ingram announces he and Margaret will sail to England to inform the King. Morgan orders Jamie to capture Leech. Jamies doesnt want Margaret to marry Ingram and so captures her and sails off. Jamies ship is captured by Leech. Jamie pretends that he has run away to join Leech and marry Margaret. Margaret reluctantly goes along with the ruse. Morgan hears of Jamies "betrayal" and heads off to catch them. Leech discovers the marriage between Margaret and Jamie is a shame and captures Jamies. However he escapes and manages to kill Leech in a duel. Morgan is inclined to hang Jamie because he abducted Margaret but she declares that she accompanied him of her own free will. By now they have genuinely fallen in love and they kiss.
