A young and honest New York Police Department detective "Breezy" Kildare is attempting to arrest B.H. "Butch" Owens, the leader of a gang of criminals who attempted to bribe him. He is wounded in a shootout between Owens gang and another gang in a Broadway night club. His police chief allows him to recuperate and cool down in his thirst for justice back in his home of Wyoming where his father is a cattleman. Once arriving back home he soon discovers the gangsters who attempted to bribe and kill him are lying low there and diversifying by starting a Cattlemans Benevolent Association that is actually a protection racket protecting the cattlemen from such perils as having their cattle machine gunned. When his father is shot in a drive-by shooting, Breezy leads the cattlemen against the well-armed gangsters who no longer have the power of a bribed administration or high-powered legal protection, but now have to face six-gun justice and lynch law.
