Classmates at the Los Angeles police academy, Chuck OFair, Russ Hartley and Harry Whenlon bond as friends. When they socialize at ones house, Russ and his wife, Mary, observe as the extroverted Chuck expresses an interest in Marys sister, Jane, who seems to prefer the shy Harry instead. The three rookie cops become bored on the job. Seeking more action and excitement, they perk up after hearing from Sgt. Jumbo Culdane about the police departments motorcycle squad. Mary is skeptical, fearing for Russs safety, but all three take the necessary training and are assigned to the motorcycle highway patrol. While chasing a truck together, Chucks cycle stalls so Harry proceeds by himself. He is knocked cold by one of the men in the truck, which then backs over him. Chuck is devastated by Harrys death and persuades his superiors to let him work undercover to find the culprits. Discovering that the men hes looking for are modern cattle rustlers, Chuck confronts them and kills one before he is wounded. The other is taken into custody, and Chuck and Russ soon go back to work.
