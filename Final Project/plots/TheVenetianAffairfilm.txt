A former CIA agent, Bill Fenner, now a downbeat, loner journalist, is sent to Venice to investigate the shock suicide bombing by an American diplomat at a peace conference. CIA chief Frank Rosenfeld specifically requests Fenner come out of retirement because one of the suspects in the case is Fenners ex-wife, Sandra Fane, who is believed to be a Communist sympathizer. A secret report by Dr. Vaugiroud could be the key, but Fenners and Fanes lives are greatly endangered, particularly at the hands of a mysterious man named Wahl, while trying to unravel the plot.
