Duncan Marsh (Steven Ritch), a mild-mannered man, finds himself lost in a remote village called Mountaincrest. His mind is clouded, but he learns later that Emory Forrest (S. John Launer) and Morgan Chambers (George Lynn), two scientists, injected him with a special serum containing irradiated wolfs blood when he was suffering from amnesia after being in a car accident. The wolfs blood, for unknown reasons, has changed the previously gentlemanly Duncan into a vicious, bloodthirsty werewolf.
