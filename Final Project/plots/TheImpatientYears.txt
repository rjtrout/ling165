Andy (Lee Bowman) and Janie (Jean Arthur) Anderson are seated on opposite sides of a court room filing for a divorce. As the judge is about to render his verdict, Janies father (Charles Coburn) makes a suggestion. In an attempt to save the marriage, William suggests that the couple return to San Francisco (where they met a year and a half ago) for four days and retrace all of their steps to include getting married.
