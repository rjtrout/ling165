When fast talking, petty thief and hustler Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) gets arrested for stealing prawns, the worst of his problems would seem to be going to jail. Unfortunately, he ends up sharing a cell with John Delano Jaster (Robert Pastorelli) a guy who, while stealing $42 million in gold from the Federal Reserve, double-crossed his partner, Bristol (Doug Hutchison)—a partner with a knack for computers and a long memory. While being interrogated by hardball Treasury Agent Edgar Clenteen (David Morse), the double-crosser dies from heart failure. All the feds have are an incomprehensible message that was left with Alvin, so they decide to release him and use him as bait to catch the partner by secretly implanting a combination tracking device and electronic bug into Alvins jaw. From that moment on, a surveillance team can follow Alvins every move and hear his every word. Unfortunately, Alvin has a talent for getting into trouble—which means that the feds have to become his guardian angels so that he can serve his purpose.
