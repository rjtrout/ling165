Vincent Lubeck (Lawrence Tierney) is a career criminal who has recently been released from prison. He would not have gotten out had it not been for the pleas of his elderly mother. He gets a job working at his brothers gas station. Bored and jealous of his brother, he steals his brothers girlfriend, impregnates her and refuses to get married. This causes the girl to commit suicide. Vincent Lubeck becomes very interested in the armored car that makes regular stops at the bank across the street, and he plans a heist with some of his criminal buddies. He flirts with a secretary who works at the bank, knowing that she will provide useful information. With the money in hand, the conspirators start to turn on Lubeck. His criminal activities are despised by his family, and they will no longer help him. He is on his own. Eventually his own brother will stand up to him. The manhunt is on... will he escape, return to prison, or get killed?
