When Muggs (Leo Gorcey) refuses to train for the Golden Gloves match unless he has his own private camp in the country, Danny (Bobby Jordan) placates his pal by enlisting members of the Vassey Street Boys Club in the Civilian Conservation Corps. Arriving at the camp, Muggs refuses to accept the authority of Allen (Kenneth Howell), the leader of the boys, and treats the facility as if it was his own private property. Later, Muggs has a chance to demonstrate his true nature when he risks his own life to save Al from being crushed by a falling tree. The camp captain praises Muggs for his courage, and as a reward, Muggs requests a boxing match with Al. Norton (Carelton Young), a small-time boxing promoter, comes to watch the fight, which ends in a draw. Furious at the outcome, Muggs refuses to shake his opponents hand, an act which earns the enmity of the other boys. When the captain (Kenneth Harlan) fails to remove the chip from Muggs shoulder, his daughter, Elaine (Mary Ainslee), tries to reform him through kindness. Meanwhile, Willie (Bobby Stone), one of the boys, steals one hundred dollars from the camp cash box and confides to Muggs that he needed the money for his poor aunt. To get the money back for Willie, Muggs has Norton arrange a fight, and although he takes a beating in the ring, Muggs earns the one hundred dollars. While returning the money to the cash box, Muggs is caught and accused of theft. He refuses to inform on Willie, though and instead runs away. Danny then forces the truth from Willie, thus proving Muggs true sportsmanship.
