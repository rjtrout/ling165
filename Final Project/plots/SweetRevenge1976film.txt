Vurrla, also known as Dandy, is a car thief. As a public defender tries in vain to understand her, the only thing driving the young woman is to steal enough automobiles to make enough money to buy a Ferrari Dino, her dream car. After being arrested, Vurrla fools her court-appointed lawyer, Le Clerq, into vouching for her character. He later learns that shes been arrested more than once, skips court appearances and is wanted by the law. Le Clerq is irresistibly fascinated by her, even after she abuses his trust and even makes him an unwitting accomplice in a shoplifting. Using a scheme that involves various disguises, dialects and phony stories, Vurrla cons a number of innocent people by selling stolen vehicles to each, getting paid in cash. She betrays former boyfriend Andy in the process, causing him to be jailed and lash out at her. She also ends up costing childhood friend Edmund, another thief, his life during a police pursuit when his car plunges off a street ramp. Finally unable to cajole her way out of trouble, Vurrla takes possession of her coveted Ferrari, goes for one fast ride in it, then sets it on fire. Presumably ready to surrender to authorities, she is asked by Le Clerq, her lawyer: "Was that absolutely necessary?"
