The opening shots of the film show Gray walking toward The Performing Garage in New York City. He goes in and, after walking past the audience, he takes a seat behind a table. On the table is a glass of water, a microphone, and a notebook, the latter brought by Gray. Behind him are two pull-down maps. One is a map of Southeast Asia and the other is a diagram of the bombing of Cambodia, which Gray tells the viewers/audience was called Operation Breakfast. There is also a back-lit projection screen showing a photograph of a beach. Gray performs a monologue in which he discusses his experiences filming a small role in the movie The Killing Fields. He also expounds on the recent history of Cambodia up through the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian Genocide. Three scenes from The Killing Fields that feature Gray are shown at various points in the film.
