The movie mirrors some details of its source material and the broad outline of its plot, but it radically alters the characters, adding schizophrenia, a murder, and a fire. A publisher, Lewis Venable, travels from New York to Venice, seeking to buy the 19th-century love letters of the late poet Jeffrey Ashton to a woman named Juliana Bordereau. He learns from a living poet, Charles Russell, that Juliana is still alive at 105. Without announcing his intentions, Lewis assumes a false identity. He takes lodging at Julianas and meets her great-niece Tina, a pianist. In time, he discovers that Juliana is in dire need of money. She even offers to sell him a valuable painting at far too low a price. He also learns that Tina has a schizophrenic personality, at times believing that she is Juliana and the object of Ashtons love letters. Charles tries to blackmail Lewis by threatening to reveal his true identity and his interest in acquiring the letters. Lewis comes to believe that Ashton was murdered and buried in the garden. As he prepares to leave, in a chaotic scene the house catches fire. He manages to save Juliana from the blaze, but the precious letters are lost.
