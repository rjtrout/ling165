During the First World War Captain Alan Trent - on leave in England with his fianc√©e Kitty Vane - is suddenly recalled to the front, before having been able to get a marriage license. Alan and Kitty spend a night of love at a country inn "without benefit of clergy" and he sets off. At the front things go badly for Alan, who is blinded and is captured by the Germans. He is reported dead, and his friend, Captain Gerald Shannon, discreetly woos Kitty, seeking to soothe her grief with his gentle love. After the war, however, Gerald discovers that Alan is still alive, in a remote corner of England, writing childrens stories for a living. Loyal to his former comrade in arms, Gerald informs Kitty of Alans reappearance. She goes to him, and Alan conceals his blindness and tells Kitty that he no longer cares for her. She sees through his deception, however, and they are reunited.
