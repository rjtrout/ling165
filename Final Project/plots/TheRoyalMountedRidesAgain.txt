Mine owner Jackson Decker orders his manager to obtain miner Tom Baileys milling machinery, no matter what the cost. When Bailey is found murdered, suspicion naturally falls on Jackson and his manager. Jacksons son, a Canadian Mountie, is directed to seek out the murderer, or murderers, and bring them to justice. The Mountie joins forces with a French-Canadian policeman, Baileys beautiful daughter, and a phony palm reader to learn the truth. The foursome soon discover that there is a secret gold mine, a double crossing casino owner, and a forger at the bottom of the crime.
