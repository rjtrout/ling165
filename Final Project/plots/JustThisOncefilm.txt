Mark MacLene IV is a millionaire playboy. He is totally irresponsible with his money, piling up $5 million in debts. Judge Coulter, executor of his estate, puts Marks finances in the hands of a penny-pinching lawyer, Lucy Duncan. Mark is aghast when Lucy puts him on a $50-a-week allowance. He still extravagantly tips a busboy $10 after a 50-cent lunch or charters a plane to fly off to Paris without a thought as to his financial situation. Lucy shuts off his access to funds, causing an angry Mark to barge into her personal life, moving into her apartment and upsetting her routine. She wants to quit, but Coulter doubles her pay. Lucy has a fiance, Tom Winters, who has held off on proposing marriage until he can afford it. Mark owns a construction company where Tom works, so secretly he plots to get Tom a huge raise. Lucy sees through the ruse. But when she learns Mark also has offered his yacht for their honeymoon, she begins to see a different side to him. Now in love, Mark and Lucy must hold off making plans for the future because the Naval Reserve has called him to active duty. Lucy fears for his safety, but Mark says hes going to Washington, D.C., and a desk job, in charge of Navy expenditures.
