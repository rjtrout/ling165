Charlie is released from prison and is immediately swindled by a fake parson. The parson advises Charlie to go straight, but the phony man of the cloth pockets the money Charlie has been given upon being discharged. Broke, Charlie encounters a fellow ex-convict. He convinces Charlie to help him burglarize a house. When they have trouble breaking into the house they have chosen, Charlie simply opens the front door. Edna lives in the house that is being robbed and has called the police. However, Edna is so taken with Charlies manners that by the time the police arrive to investigate the crime, she lies to them, stating that Charlie is her husband. The police believe her. She gives Charlie a dollar and sends him happily on his way. However, Charlie soon encounters another policeman who recognizes him. Another chase begins.
