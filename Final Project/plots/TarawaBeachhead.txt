Sgt. Tom Sloan sees his Lieutenant Joel Brady kill one of their own Marines, Johnny Campbell on Guadalcanal after Brady led a disastrous suicidal attack against Japanese entrenched in caves. As the only survivors of the debacle, Sloan doesnt turn Brady in as he assumes no one will believe his word against an officers. With Bradys recommendation, Sloan is later commissioned and assigned as an aide to a general (Onslow Stevens) back in the 2nd Marine Division headquarters in New Zealand. Lt. Sloan meets Campbells widow, Ruth (Julie Adams) to bring her letters written by Johnny. However he meets Brady who is keeping company with Ruths sister (Karen Sharpe). Sloan lands on Tarawa with Brady, now a Captain; each hating each other more than the Japanese.
