Al Jolson plays Gus, a loyal stable boy and jockey to a rich family in the South that has been interested in horse racing and breeding horses for generations. (In a flashback we see Jolsons grandfather, who also worked for the same family back in 1870.) The young heir of the family, Jack, loses a lot of money by gambling and is blackmailed by the crooks he lost to for forging a check. They convince Jack to ask his mother to replace Gus with another jockey for the familys racehorse, "Big Boy", but she refuses. The crooks frame Gus and he is discharged for tampering with the horse. Gus is replaced by a jockey who has been bought off to lose on purpose. Gus find works as a waiter in a fancy restaurant. While working there he uncovers the details about the race throwing plot and he reveals this to Hughes and then, with his help, outsmarts the crooks just in time to then ride "Big Boy" to victory.
