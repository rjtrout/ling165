When her husband George disappears after a flight into northern British Columbias interior wilderness to search for gold, Andrea Spalding contacts Jean Dupre for help, who just happens to be available for hire after intimidating a surly passenger with aerobatics in a Molyco Company Cessna 206, then landing and walking away from the aircraft as it continues to taxi onto an active runway into the path of a landing Cessna 185, with the Molyco executive still on board. Together, Dupre and Spalding embark on a search in a dilapidated de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver. Along the way, they recover from a mechanical breakdown and encounter native fisherman Elijah, who earnestly urges them to stay away from "Headwater". On arrival at Headwater, Dupre accidentally crashes the aircraft during the water landing, yet he and Spalding survive, shaken but unhurt. From there, the pair become involved in suspicious activities with Silas McGee, a prospector and hermit intent on protecting his silver mine. Encountering his brother, Ian McGee, their search turns into a whodunit mystery/adventure, involving mistaken identities, greed and murder. When Dupre discovers the Mollyco aircraft in which George Spalding was last seen, submerged in a lake, the searchers eventually learn the truth about Spaldings disappearance.
