The film opens with a single mother and her two children, and a teenage son and nine-year-old daughter, running a boarding house. The mother is hurt in a car accident, after her drunkard boyfriend crashed, and he kidnaps her favorite singer, Elvis Presley, for her birthday, getting the owner of a local pizzeria who looks eerily like Elvis mother to pose as his mothers ghost as a distraction. Elvis awakens, after being drugged by the boy, in the boarding house. He and the boy do not get along at first. The boy disrespects Elvis, accusing him of selling out to Vegas. However, the boy and Elvis get to know each other, and they became friends. Elvis even plays "Heartbreak Hotel" with the boys band at a talent show.
