A waiter, Peter Stanislavsky (Lukas), learns the game of bridge as a favor to his new bride Marcia (Young), whose entire family excels at that card game. When he gets lucky and defeats a bridge champion, Cedric Van Dorn (Gottschalk), he jokingly claims "the Stanislavsky method" is how he was victorious, and soon becomes world-famous as a bridge expert. Trouble ensues when Peter and Marcia form a team to play in bridge tournaments, whereupon know-nothing Peter suddenly begins behaving like a know-it-all, questioning Marcias play and causing tempers to flare. She brings him back to his senses just in time.
