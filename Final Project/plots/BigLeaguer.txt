John "Hans" Lobert runs a training camp in Florida for baseballs New York Giants. Every year, he evaluates the 18 to- 22-year-old hopefuls to pick the best for a minor league contract. All have dreams and talent, but the elimination whittles them down to a lucky few who will get the $150-a-month contract. Loberts niece comes down from the home office in New York and finds herself attracted to one of the players, the tall, quiet Adam Polachuk. Polachuk, the best prospect at third base, is trying to earn a spot on the team without his father knowing about it. His father, who knows nothing about baseball, thinks Adam is attending school. His father finds out about Adams attempt to make the Giants just before the best of the recruits square off against the Brooklyn Dodgers rookie squad. The elder Polachuk is persuaded by manager Lobert to let his son play in the game before taking him home. Polachuk is the star of the game for the Giants both offensively and defensively as the Giants rally to win the game.
