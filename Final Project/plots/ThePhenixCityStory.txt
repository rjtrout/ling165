In a corrupt Alabama town, the law can do little to stop the criminal activities of Rhett Tanner, particularly in the wide-open "red-light district" area. Most of the police do not even try, being on Tanners payroll. Albert "Pat" Patterson is urged to run for office and clean up Phenix City, but he wants no part of a thankless, impossible job. He is content to welcome home his son John from military service. However, soon violence breaks out, John getting caught in the middle when Clem Wilson, a thug who works for Tanner, and others assault innocent citizens. Patterson finally agrees to get involved in reforming the town, but as soon as he is elected he is killed. It is up to John to avenge his father, but his own family ends up at risk.
