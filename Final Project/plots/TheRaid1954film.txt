In 1864 a group of Confederate prisoners held in a Union prison stockade at Plattsburg, New York, not many miles from the Canadaâ€“US border, escape. They head for Canada and plan a raid across the border into St. Albans, Vermont, to rob its banks to replenish the Confederate treasury and burn buildings as revenge for Shermans March to the Sea and to tie up Union forces. The leader of the raid heads into St. Albans as a spy, and develops ambiguous feelings about what he is doing when he becomes friends with a young widow and her son.
