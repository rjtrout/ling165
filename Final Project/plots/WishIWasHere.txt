Aidan Bloom (Zach Braff) is a 35-year-old father of two struggling to be an actor in L.A. while his wife, Sarah (Hudson) works a tedious data job. In order to send their kids, Tucker (Pierce Gagnon) and Grace (Joey King) to a good school, they rely on help from Aidans father, Gabe (Mandy Patinkin), who insisted they go to an Orthodox Jewish day school. When Gabe reveals his cancer has come back, he tells Aidan that hes decided to put the rest of his money into a new stem cell treatment, meaning his grandchildren can no longer afford to attend their school. After the school refuses to provide any aid to the Blooms, Sarah suggests that Aidan homeschool his kids, and their adventure of self-discovery begins. Through teaching them about life his way, Aidan gradually discovers some of the parts of himself he couldnt find. His brother Noah (Josh Gad) is a shut-in who can only be bribed to babysit for his brother and refuses to see his dying father, from whom he is estranged. Noah falls for his neighbor Janine (Ashley Greene) who is a furry costume maker, which gives him the idea to impress her by making a costume for Comic-Con.
