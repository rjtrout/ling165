Frustrated because they cant get their songs published, Jingles Collins and Bob Grant decide to leave New York City and return home. On one last night out on the town, joined by Jingles sweetheart Jackie, they encounter Barbara Wyngate, mistaking her for a dance hostess when she is actually a wealthy young heiress. Barbara keeps her identity a secret after falling for Bob and pays to have a song published. With assistance from her father, she also gives expensive gifts. Bob at first suspects her to be some kind of kleptomaniac, then spots her father with her and angrily assumes Barbara is a mistress of a much older man. Refusing to listen to her explanation, Bob becomes so distant that Barbara decides to elope with her boring fiance Willard against her better judgment. Andrew Wyngate finally explains the truth to Bob and together they hurry to put a stop to the wedding.
