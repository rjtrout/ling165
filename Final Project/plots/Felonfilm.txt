Family man Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) is living the American Dream with his girlfriend Laura (Marisol Nichols) and their son Michael. However, their dream becomes a nightmare when Wade unintentionally kills a burglar on his lawn. By attacking an unarmed intruder after he exited the house, he is arrested and charged with murder. During the bus ride to prison Danny Sampson (Chris Browning), leader of the local Aryan Brotherhood, stabs a man and hides the knife with a young Aryan member named Snowman (Johnny Lewis) who is sitting behind Wade. In a moments panic, Snowman hides the knife under Wades seat and forces him to deny knowledge of it. As a result, Wade is sent to solitary confinement until the stabbing can be investigated. Lieutenant Jackson, (Harold Perrineau), interrogates Wade about the stabbing but he doesnt cooperate with the investigation. Jackson decides to send Wade to the Security Housing Unit (SHU) where he is the commanding officer. John Smith (Val Kilmer), an inmate who is serving a life sentence becomes Wades cellmate in "the SHU". Life is tough in the SHU for Wade. Inmates are under 23-hour lock-down, and he cant have visitors for the first three months. Wade immediately realizes that the daily hour of yard time consists of inmate fights, on which the guards bet on. At different points throughout the film, its shown that not all of the guards are in favor of Jacksons methods. In addition to the prison violence, Wades regular visits with Laura start to take their toll on their relationship. Michael has nightmares after one of his visits, and the familys finances are running low. Laura, at the encouragement of her mother, breaks up with Wade through a letter. Enraged, and seemingly having nothing to live for, Wade breaks down and resorts to fighting the prisoners. After talking to John, Wade devise a plan that can reveal the truth about the violence in the prison, and possibly get him released.
