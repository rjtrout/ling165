Successful attorney Mark Latham neglects his wife, Erica, so she leaves him. Mark tries to win her back, but finds that she is now dating Tony Clair, an artist. Julie Arden, jealous and upset that boyfriend Tony is stepping out on her, intends to shoot him. Mark wrestles away the gun, which goes off and kills her. An eyewitness mistakes Mark in a dark hallway for Tony, who is arrested and charged with the crime. Erica pleads with Mark to defend Tony in court. As the trial proceeds, witnesses begin to realize that it was Mark, the attorney, and not the defendant who was in the hallway that night. He even shows that a pair of Tonys gloves fit himself. The gloves fit, the jury acquits and Erica, realizing how clever her husband is, returns to him.
