In World War I, American pilots Mal Andrews (Charles Farrell), Tap Johnson (Don Dillaway) and Jim Watson (Humphrey Bogart) enrol in a Royal Air Force squadron. Mal and Tap are worried that their friend Jim is cheating on his new bride. When General Trafford Jones (Ian MacLaren ) arrives to evaluate the squadron, he criticizes its lack of discipline and poor effort in aerial battles. Consequently, the general orders Watson to undertake a near-suicidal mission to shoot down an enemy balloon for his first flight with the squadron. Secretly, Mal joins him aboard the aircraft and when Jim is killed in the air battle, his friend manages to complete the mission and make it look like the dead pilot was a hero. At the base, Jims wife Carla (Elissa Landi) is mistaken for "Pom Pom," his mistress. Mal falls in love with Carla and when Alice Lester (Myrna Loy), the real "Pom Pom", appears, she finds out that Tap is about to fly a mission. Lester is a German spy whose information sent to the enemy, results in Tap being killed. When Mal realizes that Carla is Jims widow and not his mistress, he sets off on another mission, with the hope that he will return to his true love.
