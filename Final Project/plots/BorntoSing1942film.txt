Frank Eastman is a down-on-his-luck show tune composer. He wrote some music while in prison which was subsequently stolen by well-to-do show promoter Arthur Cartwright. When Eastmans teenage daughter Patsy befriends some boys her age who plead with Cartwright to get Eastman the credit he is due. Cartwright calls the police, claiming extortion. Fortunately, when the boys are arrested, they are placed in the same paddy wagon as gangster Pete Detroit. Petes gang frees them all. Patsy and the boys decide they can prove Eastman is the true composer if they perform a show before Cartwrights show debuts. They recruit neighborhood children and teens to perform.
