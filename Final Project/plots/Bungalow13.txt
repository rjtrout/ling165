Private detective Christopher Adams chases a precious antique jade lion through the Mexican cafes, auto courts, and the seamy side of Los Angeles. Adams has a meeting scheduled with a mystery man named Gomez, who is killed. Alice Ashley, a woman he encounters in a bar, then picks Adams pocket, stealing his wallet. When he tracks her down, he finds Alice stabbed to death. Nosy neighbor Theresa Appleby happens upon the scene after Adams arrives. A police lieutenant, Sam Wilson, immediately suspects Adams of murdering the woman. Investigating together, they conclude that a bartender, Patrick Macy, once engaged to Adams, is behind the killings. Mrs. Appleby also helps a grateful Adams in solving the case.
