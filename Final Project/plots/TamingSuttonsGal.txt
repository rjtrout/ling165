Hunting for pheasant, bank teller Frank McClary takes room and board in the Sutton home of 17-year-old girl Lou and her aunt. Living next door are quarreling neighbors Evelyn and Jugger Phelps, an unhappy wife and a jealous husband threatening her harm should she ever leave him. Evelyn, a former burlesque dancer, gets Frank alone and attempts to seduce him. When she is rejected, she angrily tells her husband that Frank was the aggressor. Jugger confronts him and is given a beating by Frank. Lou, teased mercilessly by her aunt about finding a man, sees Frank and Evelyn together and gets the wrong idea. Franks affection for the teenager grows. Evelyn, meanwhile, shoots and wounds her husband after another argument. Evelyn pushes him too far and Jugger kills her. As the police come, Frank and Lou leave together to be married.
