Kay Williams (played by Ball) is anxious to provide feminine companionship to her war correspondent husband (Brent) upon his return from service, but is jealous when she notices her husband with a beautiful combat photographer (Zorina). The couple divorces but eventually makes amends; hence, "lovers come back".
