Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) has been appointed chairman of a special committee in Washington, DC. The Judges daughter Marian (Cecilia Parker) is intoxicated by Washingtons social life, while son Andy (Mickey Rooney) falls for a pretty daughter of a French diplomat. Thus, the judge is obliged to juggle his committee duties with his efforts to keep his children from making fools of themselves.
