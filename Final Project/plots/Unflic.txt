After a raid on a seaside bank in which a cashier is killed, four Paris gangsters flee with only part of the loot and with one of the men, Marc, fatally wounded. They put him in a private clinic and disperse. Their leader Simon owns a night club which is visited regularly by the police detective Coleman, to keep an eye on Simon and to pick up any information he can. Coleman also hopes to see the beautiful Cathy, who is Simons mistress but spends occasional afternoons with Coleman in a hotel room. Fearing that the police will investigate Marcs gunshot wound, Simon sends Cathy into the clinic dressed as a nurse to give the dying man a lethal injection. Simons next project is to steal a large quantity of heroin being transported out of France by a rival gang on the night express from Paris to Lisbon. From a helicopter he is lowered onto the speeding train in the empty countryside south of Bordeaux, knocks out the courier with chloroform, and is successfully winched up with the loot. An informer told Coleman that the operation was planned and catching Louis, another member of Simons gang, Coleman gets him to give up the names of his accomplices. After setting a tap on Simons telephone, Coleman goes to the club and obliquely warns Simon that the police will be coming for him. Simon immediately telephones the fourth member of the gang, Paul, to warn him. Tracing the call, Coleman races to Pauls home, to find him shooting himself to avoid arrest. Simon then rings Cathy to come in her car and pick him up. As Simon emerges onto an empty street carrying an attach√© case full of heroin, Coleman draws a gun and challenges him. As Simon seems to be reaching inside his coat for a gun, Coleman shoots him dead while Cathy watches helplessly from the getaway car.
