Chuck Stephens is fooled by his sailor pals Swifty and Mike into believing (and betting on) that if he marries by his 27th birthday, he will inherit $25,000. With only days to go before his deadline, a frantic Chuck is taken to Aunt Navys nightclub in San Pedro, California and introduced to singer Linda Hall, making a bad first impression. Linda eventually grows more interested in Chuck, but ends up arrested after a bracelet he gives her as a gift turns out to be stolen. Chuck considers marrying other women rounded up by the guys, but realizes he loves Linda after all. He marries her after the deadline, but unexpectedly gets a $5,000 reward for recovering the stolen bracelet.
