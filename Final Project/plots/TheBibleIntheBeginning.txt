The film consists of five main sections: The Creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noahs Ark, and the story of Abraham. There are also a pair of shorter sections, one recounting the building of the Tower of Babel, and the other the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The sections vary greatly in tone. The story of Abraham is somber and reverential, while that of Noah repeatedly focuses on his love of all animalsâ€”herbivorous and carnivorous or omnivorous.  Cats (including lions) drink milk, with Noahs relationship with the animals being depicted harmoniously. It was originally conceived as the first in a series of films retelling the entire Old Testament, but these sequels were never made.
