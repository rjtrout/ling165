Peter OToole is Peter Plunkett, the owner of a dilapidated Irish castle which has been converted to a bed and breakfast supplying the only employment for the local villagers. Owing money to an Irish-American businessman by the name of Brogan, Plunkett has the idea to turn the castle into "The most haunted castle in Europe" for the tourist trade, inspired by his mothers stories of the castles history of ghosts. He and his wacky staff of Irish characters set about creating ghost costumes and effects for their first group of American lodgers. At first annoyed by the inept hauntings, the American guests (including Steve Guttenberg, Beverly DAngelo, Connie Booth, Peter Gallagher and Jennifer Tilly) soon get what they paid for as the genuine ghosts of Castle Plunkett take umbrage with being cheaply exploited and stage a full-scale paranormal event. The ghosts of two dead people, Mary Plunkett and Martin Brogan (played by Daryl Hannah and Liam Neeson) become romantically entangled with Guttenberg and DAngelos characters. This romantic twist is the focus of most of the plot.
