A couple of cab drivers, Tim McGuerin and Eddie Corbett, cope with the women in their lives. Tims social-climbing wife Sadie has a secret, that she once worked as a stripper. Eddies conniving sweetheart Mabel plans to use this information against Sadie when she becomes irritated by her. Tim and Eddie go fishing and catch a whopper -- a beautiful woman. Lucy Gibbs turns out to be the winner of the "Brooklyn Orchid" beauty pageant, but rather than he pleased, shes actually making a suicide attempt over its adverse effect on her life. She now blames Tim and Eddie for spoiling her plans. The boys take their ladies to a health spa, but Lucy follows them and complicates matters. When a band strikes up, Sadie announces that Mabel is in the room and can do her "act." Lucy saves the day, pretending to be Sadie and hiding her secret. Sadie then cuts up Mabels dress and tosses her into a swimming pool. Tim and Eddie decide not to go fishing again.
