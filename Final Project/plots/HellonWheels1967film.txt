There are two brothers, Marty, a stock car racing driver, and Del, a talented mechanic whose work on the car helps to make Marty successful. Del becomes resentful that Marty gets all the glory, and arranges to drive for another car-owner in competition with Marty. But he also agrees to work on cars used by a gang of moonshiners, which brings him into conflict with their other brother who works for the government agency trying to combat illegal alcohol. In between the action, they all attend a local club where there are musical performances by Robbins, and also by Connie Smith and the Stonemans.
