Rosie Sturges (Joan Blondell) is a Kansas City manicurist, who has a gangster boyfriend name Dynamite Carson (Robert Armstrong). Rosies friend Marie Callahan (Glenda Farrell) a fellow manicurist and roommate, urges Rosie to drop Dynamite and go after the three things a girl really needs "money, fur and diamonds". While Dynamite is away on business, Rosie goes on a date with a customer, Jimmy the Duke (Gordon Westcott) and he steals the diamond engagement ring Dynamite gave to Rosie. Fearing Dynamites anger, Rosie and Marie travel by train to New York and disguises themselves as Girl Scouts of America. In New York, Rosie and Marie meet two businessmen, Samuel Warren (Hobart Cavanaugh) and Jim Cameron (T. Roy Barnes) and follow them on board a ship bound for Paris. Rosie and Marie persuade the two men into paying for their ship fares and also buying them new clothes. Dynamite, who has followed the women to New York and on board the ship, is hiding in the stateroom of millionaire Junior Ashcraft (Hugh Herbert). Junior has hired detective Marcel Duryea (Osgood Perkins) to investigate his wife, who is having an affair in Paris with Dr. Sascha Pilnakoff (Ivan Lebedeff). Rosie and Marie learn that a millionaire is on board the ship, and they pose as French manicurists to enter his room. When Dynamite exposes them, they fall into hysterics. Junior decides to give them a check to calm them down, and repay Samuel and Jim for the fare. In Paris, Marcel reports to Junior, and Rosie agrees to pose as Dr. Saschas lover to make Juniors wife jealous. Marcel, who is in league with Juniors wife, double-crosses him. However, instead of his wife finding Rosie with Dr. Sascha, she finds Junior with Marie instead. Junior decides to get a divorce and marry Marie and Rosie promised Dynamite to return to Kansas City with him.
