New boss Prue Stubbins introduces her to symphony conductor Tonio "Tony" Fischer, then, concerned about the upcoming performance, asks Helen to follow him when he abruptly leaves the concert hall. At the estate of a countess, Irena Reinhart, she finds Tony playing piano for a woman, Reni, unaware it is his wife. Tony is distraught because Reni is mentally ill, given no chance to improve.

She is later furious after discovering he is a married man. Morley, aware that Helen has had an affair, proposes marriage to her anyway. The countess, on the other hand, urges Helen to follow her heart and find happiness with him. Reni turns up at the concert to beseech Helen not to take her husband away from her.
