Sam Makin is a tough Brooklyn, New York City street cop and Vietnam-era Marine Corps veteran. He is unwillingly recruited as an assassin for a secret United States organization, CURE. The recruitment is through a bizarre method: his death is faked and he is given a new face and a new name. Rechristened "Remo Williams" (after the name and location of the manufacturer of the bedpan in Makins hospital room), his face is surgically altered and he is trained to be a human killing machine by his aged, derisive and impassive Korean martial arts master Chiun. Though Remos training is extremely rushed by Chiuns standards, Remo learns such skills as dodging bullets, running on water and wet cement. Chiun teaches Remo the Korean martial art named "Sinanju". Remos instruction is interrupted when he is sent by CURE to investigate a corrupt weapons procurement program within the US Army.
