Slob (Marvin), the leacherous short-order cook at the seaside greasy-spoon diner of sarcastic war veteran George (Wynn), lusts after sexy waitress Kotty (Moore). Also interested in Kotty is a scientist (Lovejoy), who spends the better part of his free time at the diners counter. He works down the highway at a top-secret military base. As it turns out, Slob isn’t just a short-order cook. He’s also a spy using the diner as a home base for smuggling nuclear secrets out of the country through a connection with one of the diner’s regulars.
