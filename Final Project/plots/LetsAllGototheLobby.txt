Four anthropomorphic, animated food items (from left to right: chewing gum, popcorn, candy, and a soda) are depicted walking leftwards. In the foreground before these characters are silhouettes of audience members, creating an illusion of depth. Daniel Eagan notes that this illusion of depth in animation was a standard technique of the medium. It had been perfected in the 1930s, in films from both the Fleischer Studios and Walt Disney Productions. Later, a group of four consumers are depicted enjoying their purchased food items. The sequential action of this simple scene uses techniques that can be traced back to Gertie the Dinosaur (1914) by Winsor McCay. The eponymous song of the film is set to the same tune as "We Wont Be Home Until Morning", "The Bear Went Over the Mountain", "For Hes a Jolly Good Fellow", and Marlbrough sen va-t-en guerre" (c. 1709). The tune is of unknown origin and probably predates the lyrics of these songs. It was well enough known in the early 19th century to be used for a passage in "Wellingtons Victory" (1813) by Ludwig van Beethoven. While the use of animation in lieu of photography lends a degree of abstraction to the idea of concessions, in Americas Film Legacy, Daniel Eagan argues that "[w]ith its simple, repetitive lyrics and streamlined animation, Lets All Go to the Lobby has a hypnotic pull that is as compelling today as it was fifty years ago." He also notes that by choosing not to simply photograph the offered items, the creators of the film managed to avoid using brand names for the products for sale.
