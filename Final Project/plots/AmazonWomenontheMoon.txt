Fictional television station WIDB-TV (channel 8) experiences problems with its late-night airing of science-fiction classic Amazon Women on the Moon, a 1950s B movie in which Queen Lara (Sybil Danning) and Captain Nelson (Steve Forrest) battle exploding volcanoes and man-eating spiders on the moon. Waiting for the film to resume, an unseen viewer begins channel surfing—simulated by bursts of white noise—through late night cable, with the various segments and sketches of the film representing the programming found on different channels. The viewer intermittently returns to channel 8, where Amazon Women continues airing before faltering once more. These segments feature: Arsenio Hall as a man who nearly kills himself in a series of mishaps around his apartment; Monique Gabrielle as a model who goes about her daily routine in Malibu, California, completely naked; Lou Jacobi as a man named Murray, zapped into the television, wandering throughout sketches looking for his wife; Michelle Pfeiffer and Peter Horton as a young couple having trouble with eccentric doctor Griffin Dunne delivering and then concealing their newborn baby; Joe Pantoliano as the presenter of a commercial recommending stapling carpet to a bald head as a hair loss prevention measure; David Alan Grier and B. B. King in a public-service appeal for "blacks without soul" featuring "Don No Soul Simmons"; Rosanna Arquette as a young woman on a blind date, employing unusual methods of investigation to reveal the qualifications of Steve Guttenberg; Henry Silva as the host of a show entitled Bullshit or Not?, clearly intended as a spoof of Ripleys Believe It or Not! with Jack Palance and In Search of...; Archie Hahn as a man who dies after a critical mauling of his life (by Roger Barkley and Al Lohman, mimicking Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert), then is roasted at his funeral by a variety of people, including Steve Allen, Henny Youngman, and even his own wife; William Marshall as the leader of the Video Pirates, who hijack an MCA Home Video ship, uncover a vast amount of videotapes and laserdiscs, and promptly begin illegally bootlegging the media; Ed Begley, Jr., as the son of the Invisible Man, having trouble with his formula; Angel Tompkins as a presidents First Lady who is also a former hooker; Matt Adler as a sexually frustrated teenager trying to purchase a pack of condoms, with unexpected results; Marc McClure renting a personalized date video that spills over into real life; "Reckless Youth" - an epilogue at the end of the credits, with Carrie Fisher and Paul Bartel in a black-and-white ephemeral film warning about the spread of "social diseases" in the style of Reefer Madness.
