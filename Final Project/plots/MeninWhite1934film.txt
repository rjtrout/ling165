A dedicated young doctor places his patients above everyone else in his life. Unfortunately, his Social Register fiance√©, Barbara Denham (Elizabeth Allan), cant accept the fact that he considers an appointment in the operating room more important than attending a cocktail party. He soon drifts into an affair with a pretty nurse who shares his passion for healing. One thread of the story involves diabetic hypoglycemia: Two doctors have a conflict at the bedside of a young girl who is desperately ill. The younger doctor diagnoses (correctly) that the patient is in insulin shock (needing glucose), while the senior doctor insists she is in a diabetic coma (needing insulin). Fortunately, the doctor with the correct diagnosis prevails and the child recovers.
