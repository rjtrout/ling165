Walter Huston plays the part of a notorious Mexican bandit. James Rennie plays as the man who once saved his life. When Rennie is unable to pay the mortgage on his ranch and is in risk of losing everything, Huston determines to help him. Sidney Blackmer, who has reason to believe that there is oil on Rennies property, attempts to swindle Rennie and buy the property from him for a low price. Huston soon discovers that Rennie is in love with Blackmers wife, played by Dorothy Revier, and consequently has Blackmer shot so that they can pursue their romance. Huston then robs a bank and uses the money to pay off Rennies mortgage. Having the ranch securely in his hands, Rennie is now free to marry Revier. As Huston says goodbye to the couple, he is overtaken by the Texas Rangers and shot.
