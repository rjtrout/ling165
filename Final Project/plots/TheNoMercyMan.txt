Prophet and his friends are carnies and itinerant criminals in Arizona. After robbing a liquor store Prophet and a friend evade the local Sheriff and stop at the ranch of Mark Hand, a decorated war veteran. Feeling suspicious, Mark tells Prophet he can help himself to water at a pump behind the house but covers him with a rifle. Prophets friend overpowers Mark from behind, ties him up and beats him prior to robbing Marks house. Attracted by the mass amount of firearms in Marks cabinet, they are distracted by Marks daughter Mary who Prophets friend attempts to rape. Mary wounds him with a knife and escapes in the desert coming across the car returning home driven by Mrs Hand and Marys brother Olie who has returned from the Vietnam War with decorations and mental illnesses. Prophet and his friend make their escape with Mark puzzled that Olie doesnt want to hunt the criminals, preferring to let the sheriff handle the matter. Though glad to be home, Olie grows more sullen and uncommunicative. Two of Olies war buddies visit the Hand ranch and reveal that Olie was their legendary commander of a 6-man long-range reconnaissance patrol of United States Army Rangers, with one patrol taking them to Haiphong where they escaped in a Russian ship. Despite the supporting presence of his comrades in arms and loving family Olie grows more withdrawn and prone to flashbacks to the war where he nearly kills one of his friends when the two engage in good-natured sparring. Meanwhile, Prophet and his friends plan more criminal acts where they steal a large recreational vehicle that they plan to sell across the border in Mexico, but the gang murders the family who own it. Some members of Prophets gang stop off at a gas station where they abuse the attendant until they are beaten up by Olie and his army buddies. Enraged, the Prophet plans revenge and a big criminal score where they will attack the Hand ranch, steal Hands mass arsenal, recruit a motorcycle gang led by Pillbox to distract the sheriff, and rob the towns bank where they will split the proceeds with Pillbox and make their escape to Mexico that lies across open rangeland adjoining the Hand ranch. Olie bids his army buddies farewell then further descends into a self-pitying alcoholic stupor.
