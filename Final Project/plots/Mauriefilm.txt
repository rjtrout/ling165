The film chronicles Twymans and Stokess relationship from Stokess rookie year in the NBA up until his death. Stokes and Twyman were teammates on the Rochester Royals during the 1950s (during which time the team located to Cincinnati). Stokes fell ill three days after the last game of the 1957â€“58 NBA season, in Minneapolis. Stokes drove to the basket, drew contact and fell to the floor, hit his head, and was knocked unconscious. He was revived with smelling salts, and he returned to the game. Three days later, after an opening-round playoff game against the Detroit Pistons, Stokes became ill during the teams flight back to Cincinnati, suffered a seizure and fell into a coma to awaken in a Cincinnati hospital three weeks later. Stokes never fully recovered from the brain injury, and he was left permanently paralyzed. He would be confined to bed or a wheelchair as an almost completely paralyzed quadraplegic, and would need constant nursing care. Twyman offered his friendship and continuous moral support and financial aid to Stokes and his family (even legally adopting him), who were saddled with the difficult task of caring for the virtually invalid Stokes, up until Stokess death from a heart attack in 1970.
