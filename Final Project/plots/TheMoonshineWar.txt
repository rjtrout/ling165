A man John "Son" Martin makes moonshine whiskey, owning and operating a profitable still in Prohibition-era Kentucky. One day, he gets a visit from an old Army acquaintance, Frank Long, who is now an Internal Revenue agent. Frank is willing to look the other way in exchange for a percentage of Sons business. But when he is unable to persuade Son to cut him in on the profits, or even reveal where the moonshine is hidden, Frank sends for the dangerous Dr. Emmett Taulbee, who uses more violent methods in getting what he wants. Emmett and his henchmen go too far, killing Sheriff Baylor, and even Emmetts girlfriend when she tries to get away. Frank can see that he made a mistake, so he volunteers to help Son fend off the gang. Still out numbered, Son finally tells Emmetts men where the moonshine is buried in exchange for his life. But when the crooks start digging, they set off Sons buried dynamite instead.
