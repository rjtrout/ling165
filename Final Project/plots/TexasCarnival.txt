A dunk tank at a Texas carnival is operated by Debbie Telford and partner Cornie Quinell. An honest man, Cornie helps the inebriated Dan Sabinas, a millionaire rancher, who is being taken advantage of at another carny booth. A grateful Dan is put in a taxi, with Cornie promising to return his car. Dan drunkenly has the cab take him to Mexico instead. As Cornie and Debbie drive to Dans hotel in his car, they end up being mistaken for Dan and wealthy sister Marilla. In time, Cornie comes to enjoy the lap of luxury and is attracted to lovely Sunshine Jackson, whose dad is the sheriff. Debbie is courted by Dans handsome foreman, Slim Shelby, who pretends not to know shes an impostor. In a poker game, Cornie is unaware that jellybeans being used for chips are worth big money. He loses $17,000 that he cant repay unless he can win a Texas chuck wagon race. Debbies in hot water, too, because the real Marilla is suspicious of her. Dan finally returns but cant recall who Cornie is. In an attempt to get Dan drunk again, Cornie gets tipsy instead and needs to drive his chuck wagon that way. But all ends well when he and Debbie end up with their new loves.
