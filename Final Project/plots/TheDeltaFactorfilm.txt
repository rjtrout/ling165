A glamorous CIA agent, Kim Stacy, gets a new assignment. She is to work with a man named Morgan, a convict serving time for the theft of $40 million that was never recovered. Morgan is given a chance to earn a reduced sentence by aiding in the rescue of a scientist who has been taken prisoner on a Caribbean isle. Morgan infiltrates the fortress by posing as a drug dealer. He discovers hundreds of political prisoners being held there. He also encounters Dekker, an old war comrade who stole the $40 million and framed Morgan for the crime. Dekker is about to flee the island with Kim held at gunpoint. Morgan shoots him and boards the plane, which he and Kim fly to safety. But with her consent, grateful for Morgans having saved her life, Kim permits him to bail out by parachute so that he can go find the $40 million.
