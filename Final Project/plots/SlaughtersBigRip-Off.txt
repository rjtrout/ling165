Slaughter (Jim Brown), a fierce Vietnam veteran and ex-Green Beret, had avenged the death of his parents by killing the gangster who was responsible for their death in Mexico. He is now relocated in Los Angeles, California, a place that Slaughter sought to escape the past events and begin his attempt to have a tranquil life. Slaughter goes to a friends house for a lavish outdoor picnic and celebration. Meanwhile, a new crime boss, Duncan (Ed McMahon), is now after Slaughter, for having killed ex Mafia boss Dominic Hoffo earlier. An old World War I biplane is seen flying by the outdoor celebration and then opening fire on the guests at the picnic. It results in the graphic death by headshot of Slaughters friend, which reignites the old spark of fury and rage that Slaughter had when told of the death of his parents. Duncans first assassination attempt in essence is a failure and only succeeds in waking a sleeping beast. Duncan hires a new hit-man named Kirk (Don Stroud) to bring Slaughter to his demise. Rather than being in protective custody under the supervision of Duncans crooked cops, Slaughter remains on the streets. Slaughters new friend is a police official, Det. Reynolds, who warns that his life is in peril. Slaughter also has a girlfriend, Marcia (Gloria Hendry), who is also being targeted by the mob, under Duncans orders, to further provoke Slaughter. Slaughter makes an agreement with Reynolds to obtain confidential documents of the Mafias operations. He coaxes a drug-addicted pimp to assist him in breaking into Duncans safe house and successfully escape with the documents. After gun fights, Slaughter and his pimp sidekick kill several of Duncans guards and associates. In response, Duncan sends Kirk to kidnap Slaughters girlfriend, a fatal mistake on Duncans part.
