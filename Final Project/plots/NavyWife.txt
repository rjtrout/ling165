This movie takes place in post-war Japan, where Peg Blain (Bennett) and daughter Debby (Judy Nugent) join Pegs commanding-officer husband Jack (Merrill). After the local Japanese wives see how independent and self-reliant Peg and Debby are, they demand to have the same respect, rights and privileges as them. At a military Christmas party, the situation gets brought up and resolved.
