A machine/human-hybrid prototype formerly working for the Red Chinese, Toby Wong (Dacascos), forces a down-on-his-luck, extroverted songwriter named Malik Brody (Hardison) to drive him to Los Angeles after their first meeting in a bar. He is on the run from hitmenâ€”a hillbilly assassin/bounty hunter named Vic Madison and his inane henchman called "Hedgehog".
