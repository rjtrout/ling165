In a rundown Paris dwelling, an angry Hagolin accuses mistress Eponine of seeing a man named Larnier behind his back. In a party at a stately home, meanwhile, prosperous attorney Lamercieres guests include his longtime mistress, Florence, and his young law partner, Claude. Eponine wants to murder Hagolin and attempts to, but fails. Larnier intervenes on her behalf, but merely wanted to gag Hagolin with a scarf before Eponine strangles the man with it. The body is dismembered and dumped, then Eponine is placed under arrest. Claude, who is secretly Florences lover, feels he deserves credit for much of Lamercieres courtroom success. He leaps at the opportunity when Eponine asks him to defend her. Lamerciere caustically remarks that Claude and Florence could do to him exactly what the accused woman and lover Larnier did to their victim Hagolin. In court, Lamerciere manages to persuade Claude to let him make the closing argument. He paints such a lurid picture of Eponines crime that it gets her convicted. His gaze at Florence makes it clear that he knows she has been unfaithful.
