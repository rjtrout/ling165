While investigating a bogus murder story in a black neighborhood, a reporter, Lucy "Tex" Warren ([Claire Trevor]) notices little girl named Sunny who appears to be white. Tex also encounters Sunnys mother, Flora Jackson ([Fredi Washington]), a black seamstress. Suspicious of the claim, Tex and other reporters investigate, only to turn up evidence (photos and a hospital record) that support Floras claim. Tex then encounters a prison convict who claims that Sunny is the child of a deceased criminal Cliff Lucas, who took the baby from his wife, Barbara ([Sally Blane]) when she attempted to leave him and then hired Flora to take care of the child. After Lucas was killed by police, Flora did not want the baby to go to an orphanage, so she reared Sunny as her own. Barbara, on being informed that her daughter is still alive (Cliff Lucas had told her that the baby had drowned), applies to recover her child and, after seeing Floras strong attachment to Sunny, asks Flora to live with them as a nurse. Meanwhile, the judge forbids Tex to publish the story, feeling that the notoriety would negatively affect Sunny. According to the Museum of Modern Art in 2013, One Mile from Heaven was "the last of the six Claire Trevor snappy vehicles [Allan] Dwan made for Fox in the 1930s tests the limits of free expression on race in Hollywood while sometimes straining credulity."
