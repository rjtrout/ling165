Set in the fictional Latin American country of Cortoguay, it tells the tale of a rich playboy, Dax Xenos, who uses and destroys everyone who crosses his path. His vileness results from having seen his mother and sister raped and murdered by Government troops, but his primary obsession is to avenge his fathers murder. Daxs father had been a true patriot unlike any of the other self-seeking Presidents in an otherwise poor country always belonging to "the revolution." Dax finds, however, that vengeance and revolution lead to nothing but more of the same.
