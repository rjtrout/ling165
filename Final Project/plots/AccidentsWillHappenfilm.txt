After he solves a case and is promised a raise, Nona buys a fur coat on credit, misses a payment and perpetrates a fraud with the help of Thurston, the loan companys boss. Eric ends up losing his job after a rival, Dawson, exposes the fraud. Eric and a cigarette girl, Patricia Carmody, begin pulling insurance scams of their own. Nona ends up marrying Thurston and leaving him. When the law comes after them, it turns out Eric and Patricia have been working undercover, so Nona and Thurston go off to jail while Eric gets back his old job, plus a raise.
