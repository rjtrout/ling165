After returning from World War II, a journalist is assigned by his newspaper to be science editor when he wishes to be restored to his old job as a crime reporter. While drowning his sorrows in a bar, he sees what he believes to be a hold-up involving a beautiful young woman and her dog. He triggers a major manhunt after calling in the story to his newsdesk, before realizing that the woman is both innocent and a serving member of the police. Together with her - who is assigned to the same case he is working on - they are able to bring the Valentine gang of criminals to justice.
