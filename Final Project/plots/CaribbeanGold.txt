In 1728, Dick Lindsay is taken prisoner by Captain Barclay and incarcerated aboard the Black Panther, his pirate ship. Also on board against his will is Robert MacAllister, nephew of Barclays nemesis, Andrew MacAllister. The pirate kidnapped Robert as retribution for MacAllister having long ago done likewise to Barclays infant daughter, Christine. The feud has continued for more than 20 years. Now the pirate intends to settle it once and for all. He propositions Dick to impersonate Robert and return to his uncle, going so far as to duplicate a distinctive scar on Roberts face. Dick does as told, hoping to gain his freedom. He is a welcome sight to MacAllister, but others are not quite sure what to make of this newcomer, including Shively, a brutal overseer of the men, and particularly Christine, now a grown woman with a volatile disposition. Put in charge of the mill, Dick gains the trust of MacAllisters slaves, who are plotting a revolt. The real Roberts dead body washes up, however, so MacAllister now knows he is being deceived. Christines growing love for Dick is a factor in not having him killed at first, but soon Shively and Dick are engaged in a knife fight to the death. Captain Barclay and his men await a signal to invade the island. When a stash of explosives is detonated, they storm the isle. MacAllister is killed by Barclay, who is savoring his revenge when Christine gains some of her own, mortally wounding Barclay. She remains unaware that she has just killed her own father, and with his dying words, Barclay implores Dick to keep it a secret.
