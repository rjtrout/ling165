Claudia (Dorothy McGuire), still charmingly naive and a bit nervous, is struggling with the responsibilities of marriage and parenthood in their rural Connecticut town. Jealousy creeps into the relationship when Elizabeth (Mary Astor) starts consulting David on a building project, while Claudia is attracting the uninvited attentions of Phil (John Sutton), who happens to be married.
