Based on the true story of turn-of-the-century Robert Yancey, lawyer and ever-popular politician in Virginia. The film starts with the statement, "This is the story of a vanishing era when simple men so loved their country, their families and their friends that America became a better place in which to live. Such a man was Capn Bob Yancey." This film, based on a 1940 memoir by Rebecca Yancey Williams, explores societal roles in plantations of the "Old Dominion" around Lynchburg and their socio-economic implications, as well as the movement for womenâ€™s suffrage, among other things. It is also the towns story, and various eminent Virginians cross the pages, including Carter Glass, General Jubal Early, Lady Astors father, "Chilly" Langhorne, and others. Katharine Alexander portrays an outspoken woman who moved North and got a divorce; the character is held to be loosely based on Nancy Langhorne Astor.
