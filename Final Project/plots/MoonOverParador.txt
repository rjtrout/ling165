The film follows the exploits of film actor Jack Noah (Dreyfuss), who is filming in the small, fictional South American country of Parador when Paradorian President Alfonse Simms, a Pinochet-style dictator, suddenly dies of a heart attack. Not wanting to lose his position in power, the presidents right-hand man, Roberto Strausmann (Juli√°) forces Jack to take the role of a lifetime - that of the dead president, as the two men look so much alike. Jack accepts, eventually winning over the people and even the dead presidents mistress, Madonna (Braga). However, when Paradise proves to be too boring, Jack needs to find a way to get out while keeping Roberto out of the loop.
