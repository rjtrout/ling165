Conan is the son of Corin, chief of a barbarian tribe. The youth is a skilled but violent warrior, who his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. The Mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corins piece of the mask, and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge. Years later, Conan is a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it by killing the slave handlers. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by Lucius, one of Zyms soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the girl will unleash the masks power. Conan helps the prisoners escape and Ela-Shan tells Conan he will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is killed by the prisoners. Zym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery to find the pure-blood descendant. Sensing something is wrong, Fassir, an elderly monk, tells one of his students, Tamara, to run away and return to her birthplace. When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant, Zym kills him. Marique slays several priestesses. Tamaras carriage is chased by Zyms men, but Conan rescues her, kills three of her pursuers, and captures Remo. After forcing him to reveal Tamaras importance as the pure-blood, Conan catapults Remo into Zyms nearby camp, killing him. Zym and Marique confront Conan, who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold. Conan attacks Zym, but Marique invokes soldiers made of sand, and poisons Conan with a boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Conans ship, where his friend Artus helps Conan recover. The boat is attacked by Zyms men, who kill several of Conans men, but are defeated. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they have sex. The next day, as she is returning to the boat, Zyms men and daughter capture her. Conan learns of Tamaras capture and departs to Argalon, where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zyms castle. Zym prepares to drain Tamaras blood, mending the mask. He plans to use the girls body as a vessel for his wifes soul. After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers, Conan infiltrates Zyms followers, kills a guard, steals his robe, and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask. Conan releases Tamara, and she escapes as he battles Zym, reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father. Marique attacks Tamara, but Conan hears Tamaras scream and cuts off Mariques hand. Tamara kicks her into a pit, where she is impaled. Zym swears revenge upon Conan. Conan and Tamara are trapped on a bridge as Zym attacks. He uses the masks power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife, Maliva, a powerful sorceress, and her spirit begins to possess Tamaras body. She begs Conan to let her fall, but he refuses and instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara. Zym falls into the lava crying out to his wife. Conan and Tamara escape and he returns her to her birthplace, telling her that theyll meet again. He then returns to Corins village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him, restoring his honor.
