Ted (Chester Morris), Jerry (Norma Shearer), Paul (Conrad Nagel), and Dorothy (Helen Johnson) are part of the New York in-crowd. Jerrys decision to marry Ted crushes Paul. He gets drunk and is involved in an accident that leaves Dorothys face disfigured. Out of pity, Paul marries Dorothy. Ted and Jerry have been married for three years when she discovers that he had a brief affair with another woman â€” and when she confronts him on their third anniversary, he tells her it did not "mean a thing." Upset, and with Ted out on a business trip, Jerry spends the night with his best friend, Don. Upon Teds return, she tells him that she "balanced [their] accounts", withholding Dons name. Ted is hypocritically outraged, and they argue which ends with Ted leaving her and the couple filing for a divorce. While Jerry turns to partying to forget her sorrows, Ted becomes an alcoholic. Paul and Jerry run into each other, and she discovers that he still loves her and is willing to leave Dorothy to be with her. Only after she meets Dorothy is Jerry forced to evaluate her decision.
