Cass helps Nellie escape and two are forced into marriage with each other by Judge Roy Bean (Victor Jory). Cass decides to become a bounty hunter. He crosses with Jesse James (Audie Murphy) who, impressed by Cass shooting, suggests he join his gang, but Cass wants to stay at his new job. Cass is killed in a shoot out with the outlaw Billy Pimple (Bob Random), and Neillie is forced into prostitution.
