Two brothers (Charlie Hunnam and Chris ODowd) seek the help of a transgender hacker (Ron Perlman) in erasing all evidence of a sex tape from the internet before the unhinged movie star father (Chris Noth) of the girl involved (Lizzy Caplan) seeks violent revenge. Cast member Lizzy Caplan described the plot: "Its about a guy whose life has been ruined by a YouTube video that has gone viral and so hes been hiding out and he gets brought back into civilization (because hes been living in the middle of nowhere) by his really manipulative, horrible brother. And everybody in his life is sort of terrible [and its about] how he deals with that."
