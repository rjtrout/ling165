The outlaws the girls find are the demoralized remnants of the Doolin-Dalton gang, led by an historically inaccurately aged Bill Doolin (Burt Lancaster at sixty-seven). Anna Emmaline McDoulet, or Cattle Annie (Amanda Plummer), shames and inspires the men to become what she had imagined them to be. The younger sister (but historically not a relative) Jennie Stevens or Little Britches (Diane Lane) finds a father figure in Doolin, who in the story line coined her nickname "Little Britches". Doolins efforts to live up to the girls vision of him lead him to be carted off in a cage to an Oklahoma jail where he waits to be hanged. With the help of the girls and the gang, Doolin escapes and rides off to safety with his men. The girls are triumphant, but they cannot escape Marshal Bill Tilghman (Rod Steiger) and are sent back East to the reformatory in Framingham, Massachusetts.
