After the war, Granger College has a lot of students who are parents of children. Among them are Bill and Sarah Jane Winfield, who have a baby theyve nicknamed Boopkins. Bill is a football player for Granger, but a tired Sarah Jane, whos also a student, resents that Bill neglects his household duties, leaving the child-raising to her. She demands that he quit the football team. Soon other wives of players begin doing likewise, leading the teams coach, Professor Hartley, to call them henpecked, while Professor Boland takes the womens side, resulting in a campus feud. Granger begins losing football games because Bills replacement, Arnold Schultze, is not as good a player. The feud escalates between the professors, who were once romantically involved but have since been engaged in a long-running feud. Bill and Sarah Jane try to get them back together. When he learns that the coach is going to lose his job due to Grangers failures on the field, Bill declares that he is returning to the team for the seasons final game. Complications involving the baby distract him in mid-game, but with Bolands help, he returns just in time to score the game-winning touchdown and send everyone home happy.
