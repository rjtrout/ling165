Ben Holmes (Affleck) is a "blurb" writer responsible for writing the short introductions on the sleeves of hardcover books. On his way from his home in New York City to Savannah, Georgia for his wedding to Bridget (Maura Tierney), hes already anxious about flying. His nerves are worsened when hes seated next to Sarah (Bullock), a free-spirited drifter who begins to talk to Ben immediately. On takeoff, a bird flies into one of the engines, causing a flameout. Now completely afraid to fly, Ben reluctantly agrees to travel with Sarah, who also needs to get to Savannah within a few days. During the course of their trip, luck seems to want to prevent them from getting to their destination â€” from being on the wrong car of a train to getting caught in various thunderstorms. However, Ben is impressed by Sarahs fun-loving personality, and starts to form a close bond with her. As they get nearer to their destination, Ben starts to wonder if hes making the right choice in getting married to Bridget, or if he should just let fate pair him with Sarah, who reveals that she is separated from her son who lives in Savannah. Upon arrival, Ben and Bridget still agree to get married since they realize even after everything that has happened, they truly love each other. Sarah witnesses the reconciliation and sneaks away to go find her son and move on with her life.
