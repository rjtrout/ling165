The Gas House Kids travel west to California for a basketball competition. The boys get the idea to sell their airplane tickets and buy a used car to save money and replenish their funds. When seeking a new car, the shady dealer decides to let the gang drive a stolen car too hot for New York to his contact in California. After depositing the car, the boys stay at a ranch manned by a gang of crooks.
