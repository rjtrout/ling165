A wealthy Washington, D.C., socialite, Sally Adams (Ethel Merman), has political connections and is appointed U.S. ambassador to the tiny country of Lichtenburg, even though nothing in her background qualifies her for the job. A young journalist, Kenneth Gibson (Donald OConnor), persuades her to let him tag along as her press attache. In the duchy of Lichtenburg, the arrival of Ambassador Adams does not sit well with some, particularly charge daffairs Pemberton Maxwell (Billy De Wolfe), who is annoyed by many things, including her insistence on being addressed by him as "Madam." A pressing issue in Lichtenburg is that Princess Maria (Vera-Ellen), niece of Grand Duke Otto (Ludwig St√∂ssel) and Grand Duchess Sophie (Lilia Skala), is about to have an arranged marriage to a neighboring lands Prince Hugo (Helmut Dantine), but lacks a sufficient dowry to make their union a fair bargain for both parties. Knowing her republics penchant for foreign aid, Sally is approached by Prime Minister Sebastian (Steven Geray) about asking her friend President Truman for a loan of $100 million, to the consternation of Lichtenburgs foreign minister, General Constantine (George Sanders), who wants his country to be independent and self-reliant. Sally finds herself attracted to Constantine, while after a chance meeting in a hat shop, Kenneth has developed a very impractical romantic interest in Princess Maria, who finds him charming as well. In time, Sally returns home to Washington, where she belongs. At one of her social events, she is pleased to hear Constantine is among the guests, then disheartened at learning he has brought along a female companion. A happy ending for all ensues, however, when his date turns out to be Maria, who is willing to marry Kenneth and abdicate her royal title. Sallys future with Constantine seems assured, too.
