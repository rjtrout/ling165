In 1883, U.S. Army Cavalry lieutenant Matthew Hazard, newly graduated from the military academy at West Point, is assigned to isolated Fort Delivery on the Mexican border of the Arizona Territory, where he meets commanding officer Teddy Mainwarrings wife Kitty, whom he later rescues from an Indian attack. Soon after a new commander, Major General Alexander Quaint, (James Gregory), takes charge. When his efforts to capture Chiricahua Apache chief War Eagle fail, he orders Hazard into Mexico to cajole the Indian chief into surrendering. Hazard convinces War Eagle to return with him with the promise the Indians will be provided a safe haven at a reservation in Arizona. En route to the fort, they encounter Major Miller, who orders the Indians be sent to Florida. Hazard and Quaint journey to Washington, D.C. to request U.S. War Department government officials to reverse their decision and allow Hazard to keep his word to War Eagle.
