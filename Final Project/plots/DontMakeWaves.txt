Carlo Cofield, a tourist visiting Californias west coast, has not even arranged lodging when his car is smashed by a reckless driver. She is carefree, attractive Italian artist Laura Califatti, who offers him to sleep that night on her couch. This displeases Rod Prescott, a wealthy swimming-pool builder, because Laura is his mistress. After being kicked out, Carlo tries to sleep on the beach and nearly drowns. He is rescued by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation from a gorgeous surfer who goes by the name "Malibu." Carlo begins a romantic pursuit of the much-younger woman. After renting a house near the ocean, Carlo cons a sweet but naive bodybuilder, Harry, who is Malibus boyfriend, that having sex is harmful to his body. He also bribes a phony psychic, "Madame Lavinia," who is actually a man, to discourage Harry from seeing Malibu anymore. Rod decides to give the persistent Carlo a job as a pool salesman. The affair with Laura is discovered by Rods wife, Diane, who demands a divorce. As a quarrel develops with everyone present, a mudslide caused by a sudden storm makes Carlos house slide down a cliff. By the time everyone is saved, they pair off with the romantic partners they deserve.
