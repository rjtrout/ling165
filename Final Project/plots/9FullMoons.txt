Frankie is a hard-drinking woman fresh out of a bad marriage. She wanders East Los Angeles looking for castoff furniture and clothing, which she sometimes sells for spending money. Otherwise, she hangs out with local musicians as an opportunity to meet people. Lev is a limousine driver who dreams of making it in the music business. He meets Frankie in a dive bar and they hook up, quickly escalating to the point where she moves in with him. Lev also makes a musical connection with Charlie King Nash, a well-known roots-rocker who has hit a creative wall and welcomes the chance to make a new start. Meantime, Lev and Frankie try to work through the ups and downs of a serious relationship and decide whether each is ready for it.
