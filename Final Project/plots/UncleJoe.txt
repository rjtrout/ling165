A whimsical picture of life in rural America in the 1940s, Clare Day is sent to visit her mothers brother Joe in "Baysville", Iowa when she starts going out with a modernistic artist of whom her father disproves. The four boys who live next door to Uncle Joe remember Clare as a skinny little girl and are shocked by how grown-up she has become. Eagerly, they all vie for her attention. Uncle Joe himself is stuck in a romance of the past and fails to hear that his sweetheart Julia Jordan is going to lose her house if she cant pay the mortgage. Clare and Bill Jones construct a means to save the day.
