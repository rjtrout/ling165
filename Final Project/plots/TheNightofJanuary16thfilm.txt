Steve Van Ruyle (Robert Preston) is a sailor who inherits a position on the board of a company headed by Bjorn Faulkner (Nils Asther). The board is concerned to discover $20 million has disappeared from the companys funds, and demands answers from Faulkner. That night Faulkner meets with a man called Anton Haraba, and is apparently thrown from his penthouse balcony to his death. Faulkners secretary, Kit Lane (Ellen Drew), enters the penthouse moments later, leading police to arrest her for Faulkners murder. Van Ruyle decides to investigate the crime. Suspecting that Lane and Faulkner were embezzling the money together, he pays her bail so he can question her about the situation. They find Faulkners diary, and the entries lead Van Ruyle to believe Lane is innocent. The district attorney (Paul Stanton) doesnt agree, and Lane goes to trial. Van Ruyle attempts to prove Lanes innocence with fake evidence, but his ruse is discovered. The two flee with evidence from Faulkners apartment, which they use to track down the mysterious Haraba. They trace him to a hotel in Havana, Cuba, where they discover that "Haraba" is a pseudonym being used by Faulkner, who has faked his own death. When Faulkner takes Lane captive, Van Ruyle rushes with police to Faulkners room to rescue her. Faulkner is arrested, and Van Ruyle and Lane decide to get married.
