Crime boss Adrian uses a motorcycle gang called the Hellcats to carry out drug runs for him, although it appears as if it is a tenuous alliance at best because the gang and Adrians henchmen do not get along in the slightest. In the meantime, a detective named Chapman is involved in an investigation against Adrians drug ring and hopes to gain evidence against him through the biker gang. Adrian has one of his henchmen shoot Chapman and kill him. Following this, Chapmans brother Monte, a sergeant in the United States Army, returns from active duty only to learn of his brothers death. Vowing revenge against Adrian, Monte joins forces with Chapmans fiancee Linda who poses as his girlfriend and together they pretend to be bikers and join the Hellcats, during which time Monte becomes romantically involved with Sheila, the girlfriend of the Hellcats former leader.
