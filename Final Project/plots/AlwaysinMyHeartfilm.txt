MacKenzie Scott (Walter Huston), a brilliant musician, is falsely convicted of murder and sentenced to life. While Scott languishes in prison, his long-suffering ex-wife Marjorie (Kay Francis) raises their two children to adulthood. Out of respect for Scott, whom she still loves, Marjorie never reveals to the kids that their father is in jail, insisting instead that Scott has long since died.
