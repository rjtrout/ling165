Monte Blue, a young miner, manages to escape from some cannibals in the South Seas who have killed all of his companions. He arrives at the island of Samora with a bag of gold which he managed to save. Here he meets a brutal man, played by Noah Beery, and a pitiable woman, played by Betty Compson, who had been forced into a secret marriage with Beery. They both run a small hotel. Compson immediately sympathizes with the plight of Blue while Beery sets his greedy eyes on his gold. After the death of Compsons mother, Blue escapes with her to another island. Here they meet an exotic native girl, played by Myrna Loy, who falls in love with Blue and desperately tries to divert his love away from Compson. Eventually, Beery discovers the whereabouts of his wife and arrives on the island.
