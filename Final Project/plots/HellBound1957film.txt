A criminal gang plots the robbery of a ship carrying $2 million worth of surplus narcotics left over from World War II. The plan goes awry when the gang leaders girlfriend falls for an ambulance attendant who is an unsuspecting pawn in the scheme. The climax was filmed at the Los Angeles Harbor where hundreds of scrapped "Red Car" inter-urban electric trolleys were stacked up at the time.
