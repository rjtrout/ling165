Two drug enforcement agents are killed on a private Hawaiian island. Donna and Taryn, two operatives for The Agency (Molokai Cargo), accidentally intercept a delivery of diamonds intended for drug lord Seth Romero, who takes exception and tries to get them back. Soon other Agency operatives get involved, and a full-scale fight to the finish ensues, complicated here and there by a contaminated snake made deadly by toxic cancer-infested rats!
