Homer C. Bundy (Raymond Walburn), the president of the Bundy Steel Company of Bundy, Pennsylvania, sends troublesome employees "Big" Ben Wheeler (Victor McLaglen) and "Chesty" Webb (Brian Donlevy) to New York City to break up Bundys son Jacks (Robert Kellard) engagement to suspected gold digger Marjorie Clark (Lynn Bari). Jack discovers his fathers plot, and turns the tables on the brawling steelworkers: he asks gorgeous Linda Lee (Gypsy Rose Lee)--the object of the competitive Big Bens and Chestys amorous pursuits—to pretend shes his fiancé, to put the boys off the trail. Trouble ensues when Homer arrives in NYC...and falls for Linda.
