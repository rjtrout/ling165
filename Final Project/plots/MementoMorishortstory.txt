In the story, a man named Earl has anterograde amnesia. Because of his inability to remember things for more than a few minutes, he uses notes and tattoos to keep track of new information. Earl owes his condition to an attack against him and his wife by an unknown assailant. His wife was raped and killed and Earl suffered severe head injuries, resulting in his amnesia. The story jumps between two time-frames. The first time frame finds Earl confined to a mental institution in which he learns through written notes he had left himself. The second time frame finds Earl on the run after he escapes from the mental institution. He learns this through a third-person narrative. Earls goal after escaping the institution is to find the man who murdered his wife and get revenge. This proves quite difficult for Earl since he lacks the ability to remember what happens to him on a daily basis. Using his wits and the help of the third-person narrative, Earl eventually succeeds in getting revenge on the man who murdered his wife, but is unable to remember his success. However, in the end Earl rereads the first note, leading to a cliffhanger to the fact that he might restart the cycle and kill another man that looks similar to the killer that Earl "remembers".
