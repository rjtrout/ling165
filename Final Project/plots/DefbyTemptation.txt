The story is set in New York City and revolves around the relationship between two childhood best friends: "Joel", who is raised by his religious grandmother after both of his parents are killed, and "K" who abandons his religious upbringing and moves to New York to become a movie star. The story opens as Joel (now a minister like his deceased father), becomes somewhat disillusioned with Christianity and decides to take a trip to New York to visit his friend, K. While awaiting Joels arrival, K (played by Kadeem Hardison) visits the local bar and meets the perfect woman (played by Cynthia Bond)--who, in reality, is a succubus seeking blood and vengeance against any and all men foolish enough to be tempted by her.
