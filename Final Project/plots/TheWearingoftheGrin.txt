While traveling through rural Ireland on his way to Dublin, Porky Pig is caught in a storm and asks for lodgings at a nearby castle, but the caretaker, OToole, tells him that no one inhabits the place but himself and the leprechauns. Porky dismisses the remark, tells the caretaker to "cut out this nonsense and take my bags to a room", and slams the front door, causing a mace above to fall. It strikes Porky on the head and knocks him unconscious. At that point, "OToole" is revealed to be a pair of leprechauns disguised as a human being. OPat, the first one, is very calm while OMike, the second one, quickly becomes frantic with fear that Porky is after their pot of gold. OPat, being the "Chief Leprechaun", convinces his partner that he knows how to deal with the pig. When Porky wakes up, he is helped to a room by the "reunited" caretaker who, during the short trip to the room, gets accidentally divided in two again. Porky, quite tired out by "all this excitement" doesnt notice the problem with his host until "OToole" asks him if he has seen his other half. It registers with Porky that he is in the presence of two leprechauns and, terrified, he hides in the bed, which happens to be a trap door. The bed closes into the wall and Porky is dropped down a winding shaft until he lands in a witness chair in a leprechaun courtroom. There the leprechauns charge and convict him of trying to steal the pot of gold; they sentence him to the wearing of the Green Shoes. At first Porky appreciates them as nice shoes, but soon he realizes that they are cursed, as his feet begin a frantic Irish jig. The shoes will not stop dancing; even when he removes them, they chase him and return themselves to his feet. He is "danced" through a nightmarish Salvador Dali-esque landscape filled with Irish icons until he falls in a boiling pot of gold. At this point, he wakes up, in a puddle of water, on the spot where he fell after being hit by the mace. "OToole" is standing over him with an empty bucket, implying he has dumped water over Porky to revive him. Porky screams, remembering that "OToole" is actually the two leprechauns, and leaps up to one of the posts that had been holding the mace. The caretaker tries to convince Porky that nothing has been amiss; Porky, frightened and disoriented, grabs his bags and runs away from the castle. "OToole" watches him run and, sporting a mischievous smile, shakes hands with himself (actually OMike) over a shamrock-shaped iris out.
