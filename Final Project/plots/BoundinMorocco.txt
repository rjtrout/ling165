As described in a film magazine, George Travelwell (Fairbanks), an American youth motoring in Morocco, discovers that the governor of El Harib (Campeau) has seized a young American woman for his harem. Disguised as an inmate of the harem, George nearly wrecks the place while he rescues her. One thrilling incident follows upon the heels of another in their attempts to get away, and it ends with him setting one tribe against another, leaving them free to peacefully ride away.
