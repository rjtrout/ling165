Saddled with the care of a younger brother and unable to find work, Marjorie Ware puts aside her scruples and goes to see a gambler who has long cast a lustful eye on her. A pickpocket kills the gambler, and the police find Marjorie at the scene of the crime, charging her with the murder. The pickpocket later falls to his death, however, and evidence is uncovered that sets Mary free, cleared of all suspicion of guilt in the gamblers death. Mary is then reunited with Edward Warren, a man who once did her a great kindness.
