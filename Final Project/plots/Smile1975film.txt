The plot revolves around the contestants and people involved with the California pageant of the fictional Young American Miss Pageant, held in Santa Rosa, California. Big Bob Freelander, the head judge, is a used car dealer. Brenda DiCarlo, is the pageants Executive Director, and her husband Andy is an alcoholic. In separate subplots, the film focuses on Andys unhappiness, as he is about to be inducted into a fraternal society, which requires a humiliating ritual, Little Bob, Big Bobs son, who conspires with his friends to photograph the contestants in various states of undress, and the activities of the contestants themselves. Wilson Shears, the pageant producer, clashes with a choreographer brought in from Hollywood, Tommy French, who is cynical and blunt. Andy refuses to go along with the induction ceremony, which involves kissing the behind of a dead chicken. Brenda discovers him at home, apparently about to commit suicide with a gun. She tries to talk him out of it, and he decides she is the real problem and shoots her, wounding her. He is jailed, but she refuses to press charges and Andy is released. Big Bob tries to convince him to not move from town. The show becomes more expensive than was anticipated, and Shears pressures French to remove a ramp, because it is taking up seating. This results in an injury to a contestant, and French agrees to reinstate the ramp and to make up the difference out of his fee. The pageant concludes successfully, though the contestants that have been the focus of the films attention do not win.
