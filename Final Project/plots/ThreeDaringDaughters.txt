Its Tesss graduation day from "Miss Drakes School for Girls." During the choirs performance at the ceremony, Tess notices that her beautiful, divorcee mother, Louise Rayton Morgan, isnt there. Louise, an editor for Modern Design magazine, is in Dr. Cannons office after fainting due to being overworked and stressed. At home after the graduation ceremony, Dr. Cannon has a talk with Louises three daughters, Tess, Ilka and Alix. He tells them that their mother needs a vacation badly, but the only way she can relax is if she goes without the girls. Louise is reluctant, but the girls convince her to go. They see their mother off on a one-month Cuban cruise. The girls then discuss whether they could bring their father back home and make their mom happy and healthy again. In reality, Louise has kept the truth about their father from them. He was actually a very uncaring man, who left Louise to raise the girls on her own. They go to see their fathers boss, Robert Nelson, to locate their father. Meanwhile, on Louises cruise, she meets famed pianist and conductor Jose Iturbi. Jose is immediately taken by Louise, but she plays hard to get, while having the time of her life. When Louise finally returns home, she has a secret to tell the girls.
