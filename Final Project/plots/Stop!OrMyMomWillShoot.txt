Joe Bomowski (Sylvester Stallone) is a tough cop. When his seemingly frail mother Tutti (Estelle Getty) comes to stay with him and progressively interferes in his life, it drives him crazy. After cleaning his gun with bleach and finding out she ruined it, she buys him an illegal MAC-10 machine pistol, where she witnesses the murder of one of the men that sells her the gun. While taken to the police station, she starts poking around in Joes police cases. The gun purchased was part of a collection taken from a burned building, and the gun insurance money was received. At the end, when Tutti is going back home, she recognizes a man at the airport. After he flees, Joe and Tutti follow him, where Tutti remembers that she saw him on Americas Most Wanted for shooting his mother.
