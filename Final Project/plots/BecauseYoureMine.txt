Opera singer superstar Renato Rossano (Mario Lanza) is drafted into the U.S. Army. His sergeant, "Bat" Batterson (James Whitmore), is an opera fan who admires Rossano and wishes Rossano to appraise his sisters (Doretta Morrow) singing voice. The rest of his platoon as well as the company commander disapproves of Battersons showing favoritism to Rossano by excusing him from normal training. Rossano schemes to have Batterson allow him to go to New York, supposedly to have his manager appraise Battersons sister Brigits singing voice but in reality allowing him to do a performance. After realizing hes been tricked, the sergeant sets out to make Rossanos military life considerably more difficult.
