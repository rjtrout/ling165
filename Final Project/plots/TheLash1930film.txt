When Francisco Delfino (Richard Barthelmess) goes off to study for four years at a university in Mexico, his home in California is a part of Mexico. By the time he returns (around 1850), however, California in the hands of the United States. He finds his family living in fear and the family estate is in shambles. Although the land deeds granted by the Spanish throne are supposed to be recognized by the U.S. government as proof of ownership, some unscrupulous California land commissioners are attempting to cheat the landowners. Delfino becomes embroiled in an argument with a Federal official, Peter Harkness (Fred Kohler). When Delfino shows an interest in Rosita (Mary Astor), a girl that Harkness regards as his girlfriend, Delfino is tied up and lashed across the face. He is only saved from further assault by the sheriff, David Howard (James Rennie). Delfino embarks on a career of Robin Hood-style banditry to avenge the brutal treatment of the Spanish and Mexican settlers, and there is soon a price on his head. Now close friends with Delfino, Howard has fallen in love with his sister, Dolores (Marian Nixon). When their father is shot, Delfino avenges his murder. He delivers the deed to his familys property to Howard, who allows him time to escape to Mexico â€” where Rosita promises to meet him.
