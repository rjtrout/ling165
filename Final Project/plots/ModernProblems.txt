Max Fiedler (Chevy Chase) is an air traffic controller at New Yorks Kennedy Intl. Airport whose life is slowly going down the drain. His girlfriend, Darcy (Patti DArbanville), has just left him because of his jealousy. Now, everywhere he goes he seems to run into her with another man, driving him nuts. One night while hes driving home from a party at a gay nightclub in Lower Manhattan, a tanker truck spills nuclear waste onto his car and through his open sunroof, covering him with glowing green goo. The next day, he notices that he has developed telekinetic powers. With this newfound discovery, Max decides to put his powers to use by striking back at his tormentors to win back the love of Darcy. He is asked to spend the weekend at the summer beach house of a paraplegic friend (Brian Doyle-Murray), who has also invited some other friends, including Maxs ex-wife Lorraine (Mary Kay Place) as well as his ex-girlfriend, plus self-confidence author and womanizer Mark Winslow (Dabney Coleman) who has designs on Darcy. Winslow constantly demeans and derides Max, while trying to seduce Darcy (although his egomanical bragging and unabashed nudity just seems to alienate her). Max gets his revenge by using his powers to humiliate his rival, meanwhile freaking out the other guests. Finally, he sees himself becoming a monster, and by a fortuitous stroke of lightning his powers are transferred to Dorita, the voodoo-practicing maid (Nell Carter). Maxs girlfriend forgives him and he realizes that she truly does love him.
