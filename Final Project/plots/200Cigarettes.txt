The film follows various plot arcs all occurring on New Years Eve of 1981. Monica is throwing a big New Years bash and is desperately afraid no one will attend. Early on the only person to have arrived is her friend Hillary. As she tries to convince Hillary to stay, we learn about various other groupings of individuals who are all on their way. The film follows several characters as they spend New Years Eve in New York City before eventually showing up at Monicas party. The party guests are: Val and Stephie, teens from Ronkonkoma who get lost in the seedy Alphabet City section of the borough and wander into a punk club where they meet Dave and Tom, who have a "package" they need to deliver; ditsy and awkward Cindy, who is on a dinner date with the paranoid Jack; Lucy and her best friend Kevin, who are struggling with the sexual tension between them; Kevins feminist ex-girlfriend Ellie, who walks in on Kevin and Lucy making out in a restroom stall; a dim-witted and flirtatious bartender; competitive friends Bridget and Caitlyn who attempt to ditch Bridgets boyfriend Eric, (who is also Monicas ex-boyfriend); and the eccentric cab driver who takes them all around town throughout the evening in his disco themed taxi. Eventually, all the characters find their way to the party, although in the meantime Monica has passed out after drowning her sorrows in alcohol. She wakes up the next morning to find many unrecognizable people on her floor, including Stephie who tells her what a big hit her party was. Monica is thrilled (even though she missed it all), especially when she finds out that Elvis Costello showed up. The final montage shows Polaroids of the party, narrated by the disco cabbie, mostly featuring the unlikely romances from the party and the unconscious Monica being propped up by her party guests.
