In a Massachusetts law firm, Arthur Winner, Julius Penrose and Noah Tuttle are equal partners. Each has an ongoing problem in his personal life. Clarissa, married to Arthur, feels unloved. Marjorie feels unsatisfied because her husband, Julius, has been impotent since a car crash. This leads to a romantic affair between Marjorie and Arthur. Warren Winner, irresponsible son of Arthur, is expected to marry Noahs wealthy ward, Helen Detweiler, but he is not in love with her. Warren instead loses himself in a fling with a prostitute, Veronica Kovacs, who angrily reacts to his ending their relationship by accusing him of rape. Warren flees rather than face the charges in court. Helen is so distraught, she commits suicide. The firm has represented Helens financial affairs, but when Arthur looks into it, he discovers that Noah has embezzled $60,000 from Helens account (although for a worthy cause: to keep the towns struggling streetcar operation afloat). One by one, everyone is confronted about owing up to their responsibilities, beginning with Warren, who on Marjories advice turns himself in to the law to fight the accusations against him.
