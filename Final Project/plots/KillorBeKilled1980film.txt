A famous martial artist, Steve Chase (James Ryan), travels to the desert for what he thinks is an Olympic-style competition. The competition turns out to be a trap set by Baron von Rudloff (Norman Coombes), an ex-Nazi General who is still bitter over the humiliating defeat of his martial arts team at the 1936 Summer Olympics by Japanese martial artist Miyagi (Raymond Ho-Tong). Steve wants to escape when his girlfriend and fellow karateka, Olga (Charlotte Michelle), is deemed unsuitable to continue as part of von Rudloffs team. When Steve and Olga make their escape, von Rudloff sends his sympathetic dwarf henchman Chico (Danie DuPlessis) to travel around the world to recruit the best fighters for his team. In an attempt to get Steve back on his team, von Rudloff sends one of his top fighters, Ruell (Ed Kannemeyer) to kidnap Olga. Steve decides to return but as a member of Miyagis team. When the tournament begins, Steve finds himself at constant odds with von Rudloff. When von Rudloff forces Steve to face Olga, a plan is set up for the couple to escape. However, Steve and Olga find themselves kidnapped along with nearly all of the karate fighters with the exception of Luke (Douglas Baggott), a monster fighter on von Rudloffs team. Von Rudloff also learns that his henchman Chico was responsible for helping Steve and Olga. When the fighters make their break out of von Rudloffs castle, Steve takes on Luke in the middle of the desert and after defeating him, von Rudloff finds a gun on the ground and knowing that he cannot ever accept defeat, he takes his own life.
