Away for two years, a woman named Mary (Ava Gardner) returns to her home in a small town (a whistle stop). She attempts to reconcile with Kenny Veech (George Raft), her former romantic interest, but he is jealous and bitter, particularly after she takes up with Veechs mortal enemy, nightclub owner Lew Lentz (Tom Conway). Gitlo (Victor McLaglen), a friend of Kennys who works for Lentz, talks him into a scheme to rob and kill Lentz at a train station as he leaves for Detroit, then hide his corpse to make Mary believe he chose not to return. Mary manages to foil Veechs plans, but she remains torn between the two men. Seeking vengeance, Lentz tries to pin a murder on Veech and Gitlo, who barely make a getaway. Gitlo and Lentz end up killing one another, and Mary finds Veech recovering from a gunshot wound to the arm he had suffered while making his and Gitlos escape. The movie ends with them arm-in-arm, walking away to live happily ever after.
