Football coach Dan Curtis (Richard Arlen) has to decide how much he wants to win, when one of his players is injured, when he puts in him the game to play, while still recovering from a previous injury. Veteran coach "Pop" Stewart (J. Farrell MacDonald) warns him that winning at all costs isnt worth it; and, he could lose a lot more than a game, including the respect of his old friend Babe (Jack Oakie); his girl, Mary (Peggy Shannon); and, his player, Paul (Charles Starrett) could lose his life.
