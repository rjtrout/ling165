In the 1840s, on an island in the English Channel, two sisters, Marguerite (Donna Reed) and Marianne Patourel (Lana Turner), daughters of the wealthy Octavius Patourel (Edmund Gwenn), fall in love with the same man, William Ozanne (Richard Hart). Having settled in New Zealand, William writes a letter to the family proposing marriage to one of the sisters. The father cannot read the letter, so the mother does. The letter asks for Mariannes hand in marriage. Marianne, decides to set off for New Zealand to be with him. William expecting Marguerite, realizes later when he sees Marianne come off the boat that he wrote the wrong name in the letter. When the mother is on her deathbed, she tells Marguerite a story about love and marriage and tells her to apply it to her own life, as a hint that William was not the man for her.
