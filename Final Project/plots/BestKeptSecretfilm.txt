The documentary follows one of the classes attending JFK High School in Newark, New Jersey, as they prepare for graduation. In a year and a half they will graduate from the public school system and go on to their next stage of life. What makes Janet Minos class different from some others is that she teaches special needs students and some might find it difficult to move on to things that others without disabilities would find easier to accomplish.
