In 1919, Bat Masterson, now a newspaperman in New York City, reflects back on the previous century and his experiences in the American West. Traveling to Dodge City, Kansas to look up Inky, an old friend, Bat becomes actively involved after the towns sheriff gets shot. He takes over as lawman, his major concern the ruthless rancher King Kennedys band of rowdy cowboys. Dora Hands singing of a hymn in church leads to Bat becoming infatuated with her. He and the Rev. Small are surprised to discover that Dora works in the saloon, which is owned by "Dog" Kelley, who is also Dodge Citys mayor. The reverend finds this inappropriate, but Bat writes a newspaper article condemning prejudice of any kind. Dora has a good heart. She takes care of a sick child, impressing others in town. She also wants Bat to give up his dangerous life, so she asks her uncle in Kansas City to hire Bat for his newspaper there. The uncle is appalled by Doras line of work and consents with one stipulation, that she never set foot in Kansas City again. Back in Dodge, she declines Bats marriage proposal, knowing she cant join him at the new job. She begins seeing King socially instead. But when a fight breaks out, Kings errant gunshots hit Dora by mistake. After her funeral, Bat buries his guns and leaves town.
