Pat, the singer, falls for Johnny and performs at his club. He is more interested in her sister Kathie, who takes exception to Johnnys ways and decides to wed a more respectable minister. Johnny departs for Fairbanks to track down his partner, saving him from an avalanche and bringing him back to confess to Edmonds murder.
