A young boy witnesses four mobsters beating his father to death. Twenty years later, he sets out on a quest to eliminate all of the gang members involved in the murder. After killing three of them, the mobs boss is informed by Police Captain John Kiley (Karl Malden) that an unknown boy has begun killing his mob partners. Kiley flies to Portugal and begins putting the pieces of the puzzle together. (Kiley and the mob boss had been partners in 1952, but turned to a vicious rivalry from opposing sides of the law.) With the help of a confidential informant, he finds out Raymond Castor (Christopher Mitchum) has kidnapped Alfredis daughter, Tania (Olivia Hussey). He goes to Spain to find him and he discovers a garage where Raymond works. This sends Kiley to Torrejón, to talk with Raymonds business partner, another mechanic. He finds Raymonds apartment, at the "Torres Blancas" in the Avenida América de Madrid. Raymonds apartment is a treasure of information, but the only personal picture shows Raymond as a young boy on the beach with his parents. Meanwhile, he and Tania, after a rocky start (she attempts numerous escapes and tries to kill him with a sharpened closet pole), begin to fall in love. On the day he confronts Alfredi, Raymond hesitates to shoot him, and it ends with one of Alfredis bodyguards shooting Raymond, who steals a motorbike and tries to escape. An accident then kills Alfredi and everyone else. Raymond returns to his house and finds Police Captain Kiley is there. He is arrested, but just for a little time. Raymond has lost a lot of blood. Tania takes care of him as best as she can. Kiley lets them both go, but Raymond doesnt understand why. Kiley answers: "You dont have to. Just keep going before I change my mind." So they escape. When Kiley gets back to New York, he is killed by mobsters: Alfredis bodyguards.
