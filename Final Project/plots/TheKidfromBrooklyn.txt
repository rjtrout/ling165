Well-meaning and mild-mannered milkman Burleigh Sullivan (Kaye) meets Polly Pringle (Mayo), a beautiful, but out-of-work, singer, whilst on his rounds early in the morning. He tries to get her a job at the club where his sister Susie (Vera-Ellen) is performing, but gets the sack for his trouble. Whilst meeting Susie after the show, he sees her being molested by drunken boxer Speed McFarlane and his bodyguard Spider. In the fracas, Speed is knocked out and his manager, Gabby Sloan, is furious. The newspapers pick up the story and photographers catch Burleigh knocking out Speed again. In fact, as before, Speed is accidentally knocked out by Spider as a result of Sullivans quick foot-work and propensity for ducking. Gabby decides to turn Burleigh into a fighter to turn the publicity to his advantage. Burleigh goes on tour, but doesnt realize that all his fights have been fixed and his opponents have been asked to take a dive to build up his image. He comes to think that he really is a great fighter, and develops a swollen head. Polly is not pleased with the turn of events and Susie isnt either. Meanwhile, Speed and Susie have become an item themselves. Burleighs contract is bought by Mr Austin, his former boss at Sunflower Milk, for $50,000, and he is set up to fight Speed for a charity fundraiser organised by socialite Mrs E Winthrop LeMoyne. Speed has accidentally been given an overdose of sleeping tablets and falls asleep during the fight, so Burleigh wins by default. Burleigh is reluctant to retire without having been KOd, but Mrs. LeMoyne accidentally does just that. Now Burleigh can retire with a clear conscience. As promised by Mr Austin, he is given a partnership in the dairy company, with his former rival and new friend, Speed, as one of the managers. But Gabby and Spider wind up working as milkmen.
