Wealthy and eccentric Walter Whirtle (Alan Hale) and his wife Vivian (Irene Manning) cant seem to keep servants at their country estate. Whirtle, having insulted a policeman, is jailed, and meets inept (and newly-fired) private detective Jerry Curtis (Jack Carson), who had arrested the district attorney. Claiming that he is being stalked by Nazi spies, Walter hires Jerry to pose as his butler and Jerrys long-suffering fianc√©e Susan Courtney (Jane Wyman) to pose as his cook and investigate. He also hires a cast of German radio actors to portray the spies and string Jerry and Susan along. Other elements of intrigue develop when Walter suspects Vivian of carrying on an affair, and Susan sees Jerry landed in a series of compromising situations.
