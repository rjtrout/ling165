As described in a film magazine, Jim Montjoy (MacLean), who is engaged to Millicent Lee (Bennett), gowes with his brother Jim (Cooley) to Mexico to make their fortunes. Jim falls in love with a Mexican girl, Diana Ramon (Vale), and a photograph of her gets into Jims coat pocket. The brothers own a mining claim that Dianas uncle (French) wants to buy, so Jim stays in Mexico to look after the property while Stanley goes to New York to try to obtain a better price. There he discovers Bob Davis (McCullough) is trying to cut him out, so he marries Millicent without delay. As a joke he buys his wife a book titled How to be Happy Though Married, but it ends up giving her jealous thoughts. She finds the photograph of Diana in Stanleys coat pocket and pretends to go away on a visit, but when she returns to the house she finds her husband escorting the original from the photograph and installing her in one of the bedrooms. Jim, having eloped with his Mexican charmer, is back in town and left to buy new clothes, and Jim then leaves without knowing his wife is in the house. The women meet, and although neither can understand the others language, they get into an argument. Blond Millicent thinks the handsome brunette is trying to steal her husband, while Diana thinks that her sister-in-law is attempting to rob her of her jewels. All is resolved when the men return.
