The Lenox family of Long Island, headed by Bronson (Frank Morgan) and Carrie (Winifred Harris), is wealthy and respectful of tradition, but their children Bertie (Henry Wadsworth) and Marion (Miriam Hopkins) are more irreverent. When Bertie gets involved with a chorus girl, Alice ONeil (Carole Lombard), and Marion falls in love with Henry Morgan (Charles Starrett), an auto mechanic, the family tries to intervene to prevent their children from marrying beneath themselves.
