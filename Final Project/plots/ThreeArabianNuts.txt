The Stooges are warehouse workers who are assigned to delivering some Arabian antique for a Mr. Bradley (Vernon Dent). While unpacking the goods at Mr. Bradleys house, Shemp stumbles upon a magic lamp that he, at first, dubs a "syrup pitcher." After giving the lamp a cleaning, a djinni appears (Wesley Bly), startling Shemp. Calling the djinni "genius," the Stooges are pursued by two Arabian thugs (Philip Van Zandt, Dick Curtis) who are after the magic lamp.
