Stan (Hector Elizondo) and Vera (Salome Jens), a childless couple, live with Veras wealthy mother, Maud Kennaway (Geraldine Fitzgerald), who has already suffered a stroke. Maud dislikes and is openly contemptuous of her infertile son-in-law. Stan dumps Kennaways nitroglycerine pills down the toilet and replace them with worthless sugar substitutes. Maud Kennaways friend (and Veras godmother), Ethel Dean (Kate Wilkinson), comes to visit, but Mrs. Patterson (Joyce Ebert)s boarding house is not ready. Unable to find her own pills, Ethel Dean uses some of Mauds now worthless ones, and dies on Stans couch following a cardiac incident. Stan tells the 911 operator that the deceased is Maud Kennaway, and Dr. Klein (Austin Pendleton) provides the necessary paperwork for her remains to be taken away for cremation. Maud wakes up, finds the body, and accuses him of murder. Stan manages to dodge all her blows with her cane, which causes her to stumble and cut her head on the radiator. He buries his mother-in-law in the backyard and plants the new tree he purchased some time earlier on top of her remains. Stan goes to Mrs. Pattersons boarding house to collect Ethels things. After Maud Kennaways will is read, in which Veras portion is to be held in trust for any natural-born children, an investigation is opened to find Ethel Dean, also a beneficiary of Mauds will.
