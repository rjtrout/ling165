Jeremy Spensser (Ross Martin), the brilliant young son of a New York family of scientists and humanitarians, is killed when hit by a truck as he chases his sons toy airplane. His death occurs on the eve of his winning the "International Peace Prize", and he leaves behind a wife (Mala Powers) and young son (Charles Herbert). Jeremys father, noted brain surgeon William Spensser (Otto Kruger), is distressed that his sons gifts will be denied to mankind. He conceives a plan to give Jeremys excellent mind another chance to benefit humanity by transplanting the brain (which he has revived and kept on life support) into an artificial, robotic body. William convinces Jeremys brother, Henry, an expert in automation, to assist with the process in secret. Because of its horrific appearance, the huge colossus (Ed Wolff) theyve created is kept in seclusion for nearly a year, secretly continuing Jeremys work on new food sources. However, deprived of normal human contact and possibly of its "soul", Jeremys mind slowly begins to lose its humanity. He kills his brother, who has fallen in love with Jeremys wife, and then speaks to his father of the futility of providing food for "the slum people of the world", when its "simpler and wiser to get rid of them". As Jeremys mind loses control of his mechanical body, other unexplained powers suddenly emerge from the strictly mechanical body, including mind control of humans and a death ray emanating from both its eyes. Finally, Jeremys out-of-control body goes on a rampage in the United Nations building, killing several people. Only when Jeremys young son confronts the cyborg is Jeremy able to restore his self-control just long enough to tell the boy how to switch off and destroy the body of the "colossus".
