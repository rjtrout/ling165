Charlie is hired by a man to wheel his elderly invalid uncle around a seaside park for a short time. Although he begins his new job with enthusiasm, Charlie soon thinks he should be earning extra money for his efforts to spend at a saloon. Accordingly, he takes a beggars sign and tin and puts them on the wheelchair of the sleeping old man. A pretty girl, a real beggar, a park policeman and the old mans nephew (who is furious because Charlie allowed his uncles wheelchair to nearly roll off a high, long pier) soon ensure that Charlies new profession is a thing of the past.
