When young Billy Johnson (Neil Patrick Harris) plays the novelty song, a one-eyed, one-horned flying purple alien from outer space appears. The creature helps Billy prevent an elderly couple (Ned Beatty and Shelley Winters) from being evicted by their greedy landlord, all while playing in a rock n roll band.
