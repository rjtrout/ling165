As described in a film magazine, Dorothy Dean (Kennedy), a young woman opposed to marriage, is shocked to find that under the terms of a wealthy aunts will she is compelled to wed in order to inherit the estate. She advertises for a man who will go through the marriage ceremony and become her husband for a consideration and then leave her. Her lawyer has difficulty in obtaining a suitable young man when Dorothy mistakes Don Morton (Fellowes), a law student working in the office, for an applicant and a wedding is arranged. Don falls in love with the willful miss and kidnaps her. Leaving her at a cabin on an island, he returns to the mainland. The cabin is the rendezvous of thieves, and when Don discovers that the gang is going back to the shack he swims the river, rescues Dorothy after a hard fight with the gang and turns them over to the police. Dorothy then accepts her "husband friend" as her real husband.
