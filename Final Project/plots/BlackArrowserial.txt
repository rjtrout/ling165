Buck Sherman and Jake Jackson, a couple of evil carpetbaggers, illegally enter a Navajo reservation to prospect for gold and end up killing Aranho, the Navajos chief. Black Arrow, presumed Aranhos son, refuses to kill the Indian agent, Tom Whitney, in revenge, as demanded by Navajo law. Then, he is driven off the reservation for his reluctance to kill Whitney and decides to join forces with Pancho, Mary Brent and the agent to go in search of the men who killed the chief.
