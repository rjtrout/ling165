A baby is abandoned at the United Nations headquarters in New York by a mother who has heard the UNs Frank Larrimore speak out on behalf of womens rights. Because the baby is in international territory, her nationality unknown, Frank is willing to take the baby home until a proper home can be determined. His landlord forbids kids, so Frank smuggles the child into his apartment. UN guide Lisette likes the idea of marrying Frank and adopting the baby, but is offended by Franks playboy pal Randy using it as a way to meet beautiful, wedding-minded single women. Frank finally earns her forgiveness and love, and the baby will be theirs.
