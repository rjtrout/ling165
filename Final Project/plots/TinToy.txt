The film takes place in one room and stars the toy of the title, a mechanical one-man band player named Tinny, and a baby named Billy. At first, Tinny is delighted at the prospect of being played with by Billy until he sees how destructive the baby can be. When Tinny tries to walk out of Billys reach, the musical instruments on the toys back play notes, attracting Billys attention. Tinny begins to run, but is chased by Billy. Tinny soon finds cover under the couch only to find many other toys have also hidden themselves from Billy there. While walking and trying to find Tinny and the other toys, Billy falls flat onto the floor and begins to cry. Tinny, feeling sorry for the baby, goes to the child to cheer him up. Billy stops crying upon seeing Tinny, but finds the box Tinny was packaged in even more fun to play with. Tinny follows Billy around the room in an attempt to get his attention, but the baby is instead happier playing with boxes and a shopping bag.
