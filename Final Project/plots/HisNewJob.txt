When one of the actors on a movie set doesnt show up, Charlie gets his chance to be on camera and replaces the actor. While waiting, he plays in a dice game and gets on many peoples nerves. When he finally gets to act, he ruins his scene, accidentally destroys the set, and tears the skirt of the star of the movie. The movies title, His New Job, had a subtle second meaning, as it was Chaplins first film for Essanay after his contract with Keystone Studios expired at the end of 1914. The movie was filmed at Essanays Chicago studio in the dead of winter in January 1915. Chaplin found the citys weather so objectionable that he quickly relocated his operations to balmy southern California.
