Suspecting them of being rustlers, cattle rancher Bull Herrick hires two feuding men, Hays and Heesman, as ranch hands to keep a close eye on both. The ranchers daughter Helen arrives and wants Bull to return East with her, where doctors can treat the condition that has left him in a wheelchair. A stranger in town, calling himself Tex, is asked by Bull to protect Helen from unwanted suitors, and soon he earns her trust. But at the train station, Helen spots a wanted poster showing Texs true identity to be Jim Wall, a fugitive from a murder charge. Hays steals the cattle and kidnaps Helen, resulting in a posse coming after all. Tex brings a horse to Helens rescue and is forced to knock her unconscious after she refuses to leave with him. On the run from Hays, she discovers Tex had shot two men justifiably who had killed his wife. Helen creates a rockslide, after which a dying Hays confesses all.
