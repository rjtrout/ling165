Amy Medford (Jenny Agutter) is a dutiful housewife of the early 20th century. But when her husband Elliot (Chris Robinson) objects to a wife with a career, Amy leaves her husband and comfortable lifestyle. She goes on to devote her life to teaching sight-and-hearing-impaired students at a tradition-bound special school. Amy teaches the impaired students how to speak, as most of the students have never heard their own name. Amys students take on a team of "normal" kids at a football game.
