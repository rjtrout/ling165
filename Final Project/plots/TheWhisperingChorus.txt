As described in a film magazine, John Tremble (Hatton), cashier in a contracting concern, succumbs to temptation and steals $1000 from his employer. He runs away and hides when he begins to fear detection to an isolated island where he becomes a bit of human driftwood. While fishing he finds the body of a dead man and, listening to the voice of evil, he exchanges clothes and then mutilates the head of the corpse. The finding of the body is reported to his family and he begins life anew. The police continue to search for the murderer and Tremble is finally brought to trial. Meanwhile, Jane Tremble (Williams), his former wife, has become the wife of the governor and does not recognize John Tremble when she sees him in court. After a dramatic trial, John Tremble is found guilty of his own murder, and nobly meets death in the electric chair rather than bring unhappiness to his former wife.
