In February 1942 a road construction gang working in Northern California are summoned to a meeting. The boss of the gang has been commissioned as a Major in the US Army Corps of Engineers and signs up the entire crew with his two sons gaining direct entry as Technical Sergeants to build the Alcan Highway. One of the brothers wishes to enlist in the US Marine Corps to fight the Japanese rather than build another road. He changes his mind when he meets the daughter of one of the heads of the project with the two brothers fighting over her as they build the highway. Their feud is forgotten when the Japanese invade Kiska.
