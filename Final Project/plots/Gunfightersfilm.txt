Trying to put his life as a gunfighter behind him, Brazos Kane (Randolph Scott) goes off to join old pal Bob Tyrell at the Inskip ranch. As Brazos approaches the spread, he hears a gunshot and sees two people riding off. He finds his friend shot dead. Brazos takes the body to the Banner ranch, but the ruthless Banner (Griff Barnett) has him arrested for the murder by Yount (Grant Withers), a corrupt deputy. Brazos has the bullet that killed his friend and slips it to Jane Banner (Dorothy Hart), the ranchers daughter. Inskip (Charley Grapewin) frees him before Brazos can be summarily hanged. Brazos makes the mistake of trusting Bess (Barbara Britton), Janes sister, but she is in love with ranch foreman Bard Macky (Bruce Cabot), the man who killed Tyrell. Brazos refuses to strap on his guns, but Yount (Grant Withers) and hired gun Orcutt (Forrest Tucker) try to ambush him or run him off. Inskip is murdered in cold blood and so is young cowhand Johnny ONeil (John Miles), which is the last straw for Brazos. He arms himself and goes after the bad guys, wounding Yount several times to make him talk, then calling out Orcutt and Bard for a final showdown, with Janes help.
