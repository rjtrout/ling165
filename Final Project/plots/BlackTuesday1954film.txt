With the help of a phony newspaper reporter and Canellis girlfriend, the con takes along five hostages, including a priest. Another inmate, Peter Manning, is taken along because Canelli wants the money Manning hid before going to jail. Manning is injured badly in the escape and leaves a bloody trail. The gang ends up at a hideout where theyre surrounded by police. Canelli threatens to kill hostages if hes not given safe passage and murders a kidnapped prison guard to make his point. Manning is horrified and ends up killing Canelli, then giving up himself and the others to police.
