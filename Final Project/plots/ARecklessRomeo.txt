A philandering husbands public flirtation with a beautiful girl—and the resulting brawl with the womans boyfriend—are captured by a newsreel cameraman. When the husband takes his wife and her mother out to the movies, the footage is shown on-screen. The husband tries to flee the theater, only to be spotted and leaped upon by the womans boyfriend, treating viewers to two simultaneous fights between the same two men, both on-screen and in the aisle.
