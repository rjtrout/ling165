The plot concerns a lapsed Catholic, Marie Davenport (played by Theresa Russell), who is about to leave her husband Alex (played by Mark Harmon) for her lover, Daniel (played by James Russo), when Alex is apparently killed in a boating accident and then seems to have risen from the dead. The film deals with Maries dilemma in confronting this apparent miracle.
