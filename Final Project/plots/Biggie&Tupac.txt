The film alleges that Knight had Tupac killed before he could part ways with Knights Death Row label and conspired to kill Biggie to divert attention from himself in the Tupac murder. Broomfields documentary is based on the theory and interviews of ex-detective Russelle Poole. Poole claimed that the L.A.P.D. conspired to cover up Suge Knights conspiracy to kill Tupac and Biggie. The documentary shows Poole to have been forced out of his position as an L.A.P.D. detective for independently pursuing a theory considered threadbare by his colleagues and superiors. Russell Poole suspected ex-cop David Mack, and Amir Muhammed to have worked with Suge Knight to kill Biggie. A key source for Pooles theory is Kevin Hackie. Hackie implicates Suge Knight and David Mack along with supposed crooked cops in the murder of Biggie. When pressed by Broomfield in the film, Hackie agrees that Harry Billups, also known as Amir Muhammed, was involved in the murder, although Hackie says he does not kow why. Hackie, a former Death Row bodyguard, wrote in a statement filed June 6, 2004 that he had ""personal knowledge" about Wallaces slaying, alleging that "persons within Death Row Records offered $25,000 to a law enforcement officer" to kill Wallace.
