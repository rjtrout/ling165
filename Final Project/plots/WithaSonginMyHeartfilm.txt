Jane gratefully marries her agent Don Ross (David Wayne), but soon both realize theyre not truly in love. Janes popularity soars, and she leaves on a European tour. When her plane crashes, she is partially crippled. Unable to walk without crutches, she nonetheless goes on to entertain U.S. troops during World War II.
