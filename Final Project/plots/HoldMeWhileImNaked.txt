The film is about a depressed independent director who becomes awkward when he asks to film his actresses nude. It features partial nudity and sex scenes, as the director becomes jealous after seeing Kerness and her boyfriend make love during a steamy session in the shower. In summary, "a very direct and subtle, very sad and funny look at nothing more or less than sexual frustration and aloneness", according to the Ann Arbor Film Festival, who screened it in 2012.
