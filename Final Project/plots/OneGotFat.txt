In the film, ten children, nine of whom have monkey faces, hats and tails, plan on going to the park for a picnic. They all ride there on their bikes together on the nine-block journey (all except one, whose bicycle was stolen and who instead had to run to keep up with his friends); seeing that one of their friends has a basket, they decide to have him carry all of their lunches to the park. Each one of the monkeys has a character flaw, and each disobeys a specific rule that prevents them from reaching the park. At each block, one of the monkeys is eliminated from the group because of the consequences of their disobedienceâ€”usually by way of a collision. In the end, only one of the friends (who not only followed all the bike safety rules, but is also a normal human, whose face is not shown until the very end) makes it to the park and, because he was the one with the basket, gets all of his friends food to himself, even though he doesnt want it all. Thus, as the title says, "One got fat!" Three of the monkeys are seen in hospital beds. In contrast to other social guidance films, One Got Fat is a dark comedy.
