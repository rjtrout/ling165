Mercedes McCambridge plays a singing waitress named Cash-and-Carry Connie in The Scarf. John Ireland stars as John Barrington, an escapee from a institution for the criminally insane. Actually, Barrington is not a looney tune, but instead the victim of an insidious plot orchestrated by a clever murderer. The only person who believes Barringtons story is turkey-farmer Ezra Thompson (James Barton), who hides Our Hero from the authorities. Things really get hopping when the aforementioned Connie unwittingly provides the clue that will prove Barringtons innocence. Co-starring in The Scarf is Emlyn Williams as an all-too-cooperative psychiatrist.
