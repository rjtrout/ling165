With a high-energy version of "Cheyenne" playing on the underscore, a hail of bullets flies down one street until a traffic light turns red and the bullets hover in mid-air while a second hail of bullets shoot by on the cross street. Afterwards, Yosemite Sam walks into the saloon. All of the patrons are afraid of Sam, yelling his name in terror while the score plays Der Erlk√∂nig (as is often the case for villains in Looney Tunes). No one dares to challenge Sam except Bugs Bunny. Sam says that the town isnt big for both of them; after Bugs tries to accommodate him by then instantly building an entire city skyline, bur Sam is not appeased. Bugs and Sam draws out increasingly bigger guns; Bugs shoots Sams nose with a pea shooter, and, after performing a soft shoe routine, tricks him into falling into a mine shaft. When Sam returns to the surface, Bugs dares him to cross lines drawn with his foot Sam does so until he falls off the cliff. Sam chases Bugs on horseback, until Bugs convinces Sam to play cards with him instead, to determine who leaves town. After Bugs wins the game, he tries to get Sam to take the train out of town. The two of them arrive at the train station and discover that the passenger car is the Miami Special, full of swimsuit-clad women. Accompanied with a rendition of Oh You Beautiful Doll fit for a striptease number, the plot twist completely changes the tone. Bugs fights with Sam to board the train, and prevails as usual, shouting, "So long, Sammy! See ya in Miami!"
