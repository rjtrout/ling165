When Mae Knight (Joan Blondell) and Sadie Appleby (Glenda Farrell) lost their jobs in a burlesque show, they decide to follow the advice of a former showgirl and travels to Havana to find a millionaire husband. Pretending to visit Maes sick mother in Kansas, they borrow the money from Herman Brody (Allen Jenkins). Herman does not have the money himself, but convinces his boss, Butch ONeill, to loan it to him the money. Unfortunately, Herman loses the money gambling and decides to forge Butchs name to an insurance policy in order to replace the missing funds. In Havana, Sadie and Mae pretend to be rich widows. They think they have it made when they meet Deacon Jones (Guy Kibbee) a wealthy man who cannot afford a scandal. However, Mae is smitten with Deacons handsome son Bob Jones (Lyle Talbot) but finds out that Bob has no money of his own. When Mae and Sadie are introduced to Deacons wife, they realize that a marriage proposal from him is out of the question. Their lawyer, Duffy (Frank McHugh) advises them to trap Deacon in a scandalous situation and blackmail him instead. Meanwhile, the bank calls to verify the forged check. Herman tries to collect his payoff from the agent who sold him the policy, only to discover that he has left town. When he tries to track down Sadie and Mae to get his money back, he learns that they are not in Kansas. Herman decides to follow them to Havana. He meets Duffy in a local bar, and Duffy talks Herman into playing Maes outraged husband, which he agreed because it was the only way to get his money. Duffy has Deacon kidnapped, but he resists Maes seduction attempts. Nevertheless, a photographer catches him wrapped in a sheet with Mae and the photos help Deacons wife to get a divorce. Butch finds Herman, but he only wants him to return to work because his luck has been bad ever since Herman left. Bob gets a job in New York and married Mae, and Sadie marries Herman.
