Brothers Treat (Matthew Modine) and Philip (Kevin Anderson) have lived alone since they were kids when a small-time criminal enters their lives. Living without a father, the orphaned brothers subsist off the proceeds of petty theft in a run-down North Philadelphia row house. One night he kidnaps an enigmatic rich man, played by Albert Finney, who becomes the kind of father figure the boys have always longed for.
