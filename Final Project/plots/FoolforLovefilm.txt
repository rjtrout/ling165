May (Kim Basinger) is hiding out at an old motel in the Southwest. An old flame and childhood friend, Eddie (Sam Shepard) shows up. He threatens to metaphorically and at times, literally, drag her back into the life she had fled from. The film focuses on the couples fluctuating past and present relationships, and the dark secrets hidden within, including one from an old man who lives near the motel (Harry Dean Stanton).
