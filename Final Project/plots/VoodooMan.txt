Nicholas (George Zucco) runs a filling station in the sticks. In reality, he is helping Dr. Richard Marlowe (Bela Lugosi) capture comely young ladies so he can transfer their life essences to his long-dead wife. Also assisting is Toby (John Carradine), who lovingly shepherds the left-over zombie girls and pounds on bongos during voodoo ceremonies. The hero is a Hollywood screenwriter who, at the end of the picture, turns the experience into a script titled "Voodoo Man". When his producer asks who should star in it, the hero suggests ... Bela Lugosi.
