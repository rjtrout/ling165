The film is based on Lloyd (Todd Bosley), the "class clown." He often gets in trouble with teachers, one of which is very strict. When he tries to rebel, he is put into a class for "less enthusiastic students." Once there, he teams up with other students in the group: Troy (Brendon Ryan Barrett), Carla (Chloe Peterson), and Storm (Patrick Higgins). He soon falls in love with the class newest member, Tracy (Kristin Parker). However, she is taken by Storm. When Lloyd talks to his mother, she tells him that he can still win her back by being himself. The role of Lloyd is played by Todd Bosley. Tom Arnold, a friend of the producers, played a small role.
