Johnnie Adams, an engraver in Washington, uses some of the invitations his firm makes to crash Washington parties. He gets to be called "Admiral," and is accepted as part of the social group. Johnnie meets Anne Richards, interested in preventing a gas company from drilling on certain west coast lands, destroying the breeding grounds of some California condors. She enlists his aid, and he asks Steve Bennett, a lobbyist, for help. Bennetts company is also employed by the gas outfit. When an investigating committee gets on the job, Johnnies actual position is exposed, and he comes in for national publicity. This makes it possible for the bird sanctuary to be saved, and Johnnie gets his job back, with a promotion. Steve, who has had a falling out with Anne, finds himself invited to his own wedding, with Anne.
