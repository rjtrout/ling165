In Wilmington, Delaware, Anna Thompson sells beauty products to doctors but her company lets her go when her performance is not up to par. She is a chain smoker and bulimic and feels the need to run away from her life. When she narrowly misses being the victim of an armed robbery in a store, she gets on a bus and travels to where her family used to have a vacation cottage in Massachusetts. Along the way she meets Travis (who calls himself Danny), who is also running away from his problems.
