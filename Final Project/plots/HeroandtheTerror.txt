Danny OBrien (Chuck Norris) is a cop who likes to work alone and never waits for his back up. In Los Angeles, OBrien is trying to apprehend the notorious Simon Moon (Jack OHalloran), also known as The Terror. Simon has been killing women by snapping their necks and taking them to his lair in an abandoned movie theater. OBrien is attacked by Simon who almost kills him in the struggle. When the killer flees the scene and climbs up a ladder he slips and falls, knocking himself unconscious. When the backup arrives they think OBrien caught The Terror and the people of L.A. call him "Hero". Simon is then arrested and taken to jail. When Dr. Highwater (Billy Drago) goes to visit Simon he escapes by cutting through the bars of his cell. He then steals a laundry van by push starting it but loses control and falls straight down into a cliff face. When the media hears about this they pronounce Simon dead and the people of L.A. are relieved. Three years later the murders start back up again and OBrien thinks its The Terror. He eventually finds where his lair is and heads in to confront Simon himself. He encounters an enclosed room not on the map and heads in. In there he finds the bodies of The Terrors victims and starts searching around for him. Simon jumps out and attacks him and Danny tries to fight him off. OBrien eventually kills The Terror and the film ends, as he marries his girlfriend who gave birth to their daughter.
