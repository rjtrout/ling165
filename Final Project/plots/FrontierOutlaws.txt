A gang of cattle rustlers and claim jumpers are terrorising the town of Wolf Valley and hire a fast gun to get rid of Billy Carson by running him out of town. To the villains surprise Billy comes to a saloon frequented by the villains and runs the frightened gunslinger out of town. When the gunslinger tries to shoot Billy in the back with a concealed derringer Billy finishes him off. Though Judge James Ryan is well aware of the true situation he sentences Billy to a jail sentence of 30 days but secretly lets Billy loose to finish off the villains. Billy disguises himself as a Mexican Charro interested in buying Barlows rustled cattle in order to gain information to bring the outlaws to justice. Meanwhile, the outlaws threaten the feisty owner of the Circle C Ranch Ma Clark, but Ma is not the type to be pushed around; and she has her sights set on marrying Judge Ryan.
