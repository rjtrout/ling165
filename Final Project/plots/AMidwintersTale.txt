The story is set in Hope, Derbyshire, England. Its Christmastime, and tis the season to put on Shakespeares most cheery seasonal play: Hamlet. Joe Harper takes the project on as a Final Stand of sorts under the encouragement of his catty agent, advertising in the local newspaper for actors at a low price. From the rabble of actors both strange and untalented, he chooses the following: Hamlet: Joe Harper himself. Ophelia: Nina Raymond, a shortsighted well-meaning space cadet who has been using low-calorie mayonnaise for lotion because she cant make out the label. King Claudius: Henry Wakefield, a long-suffering and cynical old Englishman with a sharp tongue and a list of prejudices five miles (8 km) long, forced to room with Queen Gertrudes player. Queen Gertrude: Terry DuBois, a flamboyantly gay theatrical actor with an estranged son and a preoccupation with costume. Laertes, Fortinbras, and various roles: Tom Newman, a vain, self-righteous method actor who foists his values on everyone else and attempts to distinguish his many characters with a variety of outrageous accents. Horatio, Bernardo: Not-so-subtle Carnforth Greville, an alcoholic in denial and a kindly bachelor with no memory for lines whatsoever. Polonius, Marcellus, and the First Gravedigger: Vernon Spatch, the ambitious techies techie, self-imposed marketing director, and unofficial documentarian of the proceedings. Set Designer: Fadge, just Fadge, specialising in new-age art and obscure statements about "air", "space", and "fog". Close friends call her "Fa".
