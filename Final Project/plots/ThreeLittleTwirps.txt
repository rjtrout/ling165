The Stooges are poster hangers who manage to destroy one of the main posters when Moe pushed Curly into the poster just as their boss Herman (Stanley Blystone) comes by to check on them and they just got fired. The boys soon realize that their pay consists of tickets to the circus, but when Curly finds a huge roll of tickets, the trio start scalping them at discount price. After being caught by the circus owner (Herman as well) and the local sheriff (Bud Jamison), Herman decides to hire the Stooges as human targets for the spear-throwing "Sultan of Abudaba" (Duke York).
