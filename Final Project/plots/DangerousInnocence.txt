On a ship sailing from England to India, Ann Church (Laura La Plante) meets young and dashing Major Anthony Seymour (Eugene OBrien), falls in love and makes some innocent advances to gain his attentions. Ann is 19, but looks 15. The Major at first resists her advances because he believes she is that young, and later he holds back after learning that Anns mother Muriel (Hedda Hopper) was his ex-girlfriend. Another passenger, Gilchrist (Jean Hersholt) who is a cad, takes advantage of Anns naivet√© and places her in a compromising position. To save her reputation, the Major proposes to Ann and she accepts. When they arrive in Bombay, Gilchrist gets even by telling Ann that the Major had had an affair with her mother, causing Ann to break the engagement. Angry, the Major follows Gilchrist off ship and thrashes him. As she prepares to return alone to England, the Major forces Gilchrist to admit to Ann that the relationship between the Major and Anns mother was platonic and never romantic. The young couple reunite and are later married at sea.
