Once a big-league baseball player known as the Philly Flash, he is now broke and a drunk, reduced to a life on the street, washing car windshields for spare change or trying to sell stolen wristwatches to passersby. Emily, in her alter ego as "Chu Chu," is a street performer and one-woman band. She gives music lessons in her small apartment, but isnt successful at it. One day, a man drops his briefcase and Chu Chu retrieves it. She and the Flash discover it is filled with government documents, so they scheme to return it to its rightful owner but only if they can get $50 for their trouble, maybe even more. They get trouble, all right, with a variety of agents coming after them to get the documents back.
