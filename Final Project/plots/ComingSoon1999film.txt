Three wealthy, savvy high school seniors, Stream Hodsell (Bonnie Root), a smart, down-to-earth strawberry blonde, sassy Jenny Simon (Gaby Hoffmann), who masks her intelligence behind a guise of fishnet stockings, and soulful Nell Kellner (Tricia Vessey) attend the prestigious and expensive Halton School in Manhattan and have everything - brains, beauty, money, popularity, powerful parents, and boyfriends like Chad (James Roday) and a garage band musician, Henry Rockefeller Lipschitz (Ryan Reynolds). They have it all but are still unfulfilled. After losing her virginity without obtaining sexual satisfaction, Stream is confused as well as unfulfilled and studies the problem with self-help books, womens magazines and the comically misinformed advice of her peers. Judy Hodsell (Mia Farrow) is Streams distracted ex-hippie mom, Dick Hodsell (Ryan ONeal) is her yuppie father with a new young girlfriend, Mimi (Yasmine Bleeth), and Mr. Jennings (Spalding Gray) is a feel-good career counselor.
