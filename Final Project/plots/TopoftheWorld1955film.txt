Unable to fly jet missions at his age, Major (soon promoted to Lieutenant Colonel) Lee Gannon is reassigned from a Californian air base to a weather station in Alaska, against his wishes. He perks up on learning that ex-wife Virgie now owns a nightclub in Fairbanks. Gannon reports for duty to Major Brad Cantrell, who explains to a skeptical Gannon how vital the weather situation is, apparently in a remote region near the North Pole that could be vulnerable to a Soviet air attack. Lieutenant Mary Ross, who handles public relations, is in love with Cantrell, but he has become attracted to Virgie and plans to marry her. Virgie reveals a dark secret about her marriage with Gannon, then accuses Cantrell of sending her former husband on a dangerous mission just to get him out of the way. Stationed on a large block of drift ice far north of Alaska, Gannon and his men are at great risk as the floe melts and rescue planes are unable to land. Cantrell pilots a glider to rescue the men, with Gannon volunteering to be left behind, then stages a daring return trip. Gannon realizes he still loves Virgie, and a relieved Mary realizes she hasnt lost Cantrell.
