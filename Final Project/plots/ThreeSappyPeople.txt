The Stooges are phone repairmen who are mistaken for the psychiatrists in whose office they are working, Drs. Z. Ziller (Curly), X. Zeller (Larry), and Y. Zoller (Moe). Wealthy J. Rumsford Rumford (Don Beddoe), upon the recommendation of a doctor friend of his, hires them to treat his impetuous, free-spirited young wife, Sherry Rumford (Lorna Gray). The Stooges ruin their clients dinner party in their usual style, leading into a food fight, but because their antics so amuse his wife, her husband believes that she is cured and the Stooges are paid handsomely for their efforts. However, when the husband presents a birthday cake to his wife, he purposely drops the cake on the top of her head, ending her joyous frenzy.
