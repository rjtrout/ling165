In Los Angeles, Detective Billie York (an uncredited Whoopi Goldberg) is murdered by a man (Tim Curry) dressed as a Girl Scout because she possesses a microfilm with the recipe to turn cocaine into Girl Scout cookies and she wouldnt hand it over to the ones who seek it. Her former partner, Wes Luger (Samuel L. Jackson), takes the case in an attempt to avenge her death. As part of the terms for letting Luger take the case, psychotic burned-out narcotics agent Jack Colt (Emilio Estevez) is assigned to the case with Luger. Under the advice of their captain (Frank McRae), they meet Dr. Harold Leacher (F. Murray Abraham), who informs Jack that the case has something to do with General Mortars (William Shatner), under whom Jack had worked during his days in Vietnam. Following Leachers advice, they pursue the villains; however, before the villains are apprehended, Luger must journey into his past to realize the right thing to do. In the end, the pair find themselves up against a complicated plot involving corrupt cops, federal agents, politicians and beauty queens. Not knowing who to trust, its time for the pair to do what they do best - and that involves guns, explosions, and lots and lots of destruction.
