After a British Army Officer is cashiered in India following accusations of dereliction of duty, he summons his four sons to meet him in their family home. He reveals he has been framed, but before he can explain any more he is murdered. The four immediately set out to discover the truth and restore their fathers honour. Spreading out across the world to Argentina and India they gather the evidence that shows that their father was a victim of a major arms dealer and triumph over him in a final confrontation in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Returning home they are able to present evidence that clears their fathers name.
