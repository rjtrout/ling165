Law-abiding farmers, the Dalton brothers move to Kansas to begin a new life. Bob Dalton meets lawyer Tod Jackson and persuades him to defend his kin Ben Dalton in a court case against a corrupt land development company. A melee erupts during the trial, resulting in the Daltons needing to shoot their way out of the courtroom. A negative light is cast on the Daltons by cronies of the land developers and the press. Ben is shot in the back. Unable to get by lawfully, the Daltons rob a stage coach and their reputation as dangerous outlaws spreads. Tod, meantime, has fallen in love with Bob Daltons fiancee, Julie. He strongly urges the Daltons to change their ways, but they defy brother Bob and decide to pull one more bank job in Kansas, a decision that proves fatal.
