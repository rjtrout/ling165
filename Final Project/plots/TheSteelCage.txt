In three separate stories, San Quentin warden Duffy must contend with a crisis at the prison. Louis, a prison cook, is about to be paroled, upsetting fellow inmate Brenner, who loves Louiss food so much that he tries to bribe him to stay behind bars. After that plan fails, a customer comes to a restaurant where Louis has been hired as chef. His insults about the dishes are so insulting, Louis smashes a plate over his head, breaking his parole. Behind prison walls again, Louis learns that Brenners the one who sent the customer, Lee Filbert, who is now a San Quentin prisoner himself. Ruthless convict Chet Harmon plans a breakout with help from brothers Al and Frank. A gun is planted and Chet is almost successful, taking Warden Duffy hostage, but Al has second thoughts after his brother is seriously wounded. A mural of The Last Supper needs repair in the prisons chapel, so chaplain Harvey asks an artistically inclined inmate named Steinberg to do the restoration. Two other prisoners are sneaking in liquor through the chapel, so Steinberg demands a piece of their action. They end up taking the priest hostage as Duffy deals with a deadly confrontation.
