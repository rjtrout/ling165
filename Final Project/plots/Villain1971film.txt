Ruthless East End gangster Vic Dakin has plans for an ambitious raid on the wages van of a plastics factory. This is a departure from Dakins usual modus operandi and the job is further complicated by his having to work with fellow gangster Frank Fletchers firm. Essentially a standard story about a heist, there are intricate sub-plots depicting: Dakins sadistic nature Dakins relationship with Wolfie Wolfies bisexual relationship with Venetia and Dakin Dakins irritation at having to work with Frank Fletchers seemingly weak brother-in-law Ed Lowis MP Gerald Draycott being blackmailed by Dakin (via Wolfie) to provide a cast-iron alibi Detectives Bob Matthews and Tom Binney pursuing Dakin and Lissner. In a growing trend for movies of the same era and genre (Get Carter, A Clockwork Orange, The French Connection for example) some of the violence is quite graphic especially during the heist and foreshadows several 1970s cop TV shows such as The Sweeney, Target and Special Branch.
