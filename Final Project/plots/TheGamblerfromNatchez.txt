Apart from his gambler father for four years, Vance Colby is summoned by him. On a riverboat, a German named Gottfried accuses him of cheating, also impugning his fathers reputation, but when Vances back is turned and Gottfried comes after him, riverboat captain Barbees attractive daughter Melanie intervenes to save Vance. While ashore, Vance comes to the aid of Yvette Rivage when her carriages horse is lame. At her family manor, Araby, he meets her father Andre and fiance Claude St. Germaine, who react harshly, also bringing up Vances fathers reputation as a cheat. Vance discovers that his fathers news was that he had won a half-interest in a new gambling vessel Rivage and St. Germaine were about to launch. Then he learns they had his dad killed, framing him by planting evidence that he had won unfairly. Vances life is saved by Melanie a second time, and he also survives a duel with Nicholas Cadiz, shooting him in self-defense after Cadiz tries to use a hidden derringer. Rivage engages Vance in a card game and loses everything, including Araby, but gallantly, Vance returns the estates deed to a grateful Yvette. She invites him to stay and share Araby with her, but Vance has other plans, which include Melanie.
