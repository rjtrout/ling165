Young Ricardo Quintano (Don Ameche) voyages from Argentina to New York to sell some of his fathers prize horses. Before leaving, Don Diego (Henry Stephenson) instructs his son that no steeds are to be sold to Binnie Crawford (Charlotte Greenwood) or any member of her family because her brother Willis cheated him years earlier. Upon arriving in New York, Ricardo falls in love with Glenda Crawford (Betty Grable), but when he learns that she is Binnies niece, he refuses to sell her the horse she wants to buy. He hurriedly returns to Argentina. Perturbed, Glenda follows him, accompanied by Binnie. The couple meet again in Argentina, where they confess their love for each other. Ricardo introduces Glenda to his father as "Miss Cunningham." Glenda encourages Ricardo to enter his fathers prize jumper, Furioso, in a race, against Don Diegos wishes. Soon after, while attending a horse show, Don Diego discovers Glendas true identity and disowns his son. His bad mood is compounded when Furioso refuses to jump and runs off the field. To make up for the humiliating defeat of his fathers jumper, Ricardo enters Furioso in the big race, and when the horse wins, Don Diego changes his mind about racing horses and about Glenda.
