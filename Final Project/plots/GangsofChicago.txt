After the death of his corrupt father, young Matty Burns enrolls in law school, not to seek justice but to learn how to represent criminal organizations while remaining within the law. He graduates with roommate Bill Whitaker, a judges son, and is invited to come live at the Whitaker farm, where June Whitaker finds herself attracted to her brother Bills friend. With a federal agent named Evans keeping a close eye on his activities, Matty becomes the legal mouthpiece of Jim Ramsey, a racketeer. Bill is beseeched by agent Evans to spy on his friend, which he does reluctantly at the urging of his law-abiding dad. Ramsey and his moll, Virginia Brandt, dont trust Bill and spring a trap, catching him red-handed seeking evidence. Bill is seriously wounded by thug Pinkys gunshot and rushed to a doctor by Matty, his friend. Both later hide out at the family farm, where Ramsey and his men come to finish the job. They are vanquished, but Matty must now do time behind bars.
