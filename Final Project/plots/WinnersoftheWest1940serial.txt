The Hartford Transcontinental Railroad is attempting to build a railroad through "Hells Gate Pass". However, King Carter, the self-appointed ruler of the land beyond the pass, does not want this to happen. He sends henchmen, including local Indians, to disrupt the construction anyway they can, from sabotage to kidnapping Claire Hartford, the daughter of the company President. The Presidents assistant, Jeff Ramsay, and his sidekicks, stop King Carters schemes at every point and eventually defeat him entirely. This opens the area up to new settlers, the first of which is Jeff himself and his new wife Claire.
