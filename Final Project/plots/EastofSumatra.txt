Duke Mullane (Jeff Chandler), manager of a Malayan tin mine, goes to a little-known island to open a new mine in the jungle. Initially, the natives are friendly, especially dancer Minyora...who is soon to be married to local ruler King Kiang (Anthony Quinn). A series of unfortunate incidents changes Kiangs attitude to hostility, and Duke is stranded with his crew, Minyora, and his old flame Lory (Marilyn Maxwell), who is engaged to his boss.
