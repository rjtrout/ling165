Two Confederate veterans, broke and homeless, are making their way to Texas to start fresh. After comedic adventures getting into and out of trouble, just trying to make enough move to get to Texas, they witness a stagecoach robbery and manage to hold up the outlaws and take back the cash. At that point they have a difference of opinion; the "good" one Tod Ramsey (Glenn Ford) wants to give it back, the "bad" one Dan Thomas (William Holden) wants to keep it and keep going. Goodness wins out, and both are off the hook. Tod takes a job with the biggest local rancher (who has a beautiful and friendly daughter, "Mike" King (Claire Trevor). Dan stumbles into a different kind of jobâ€”with another rancher who specializes in rustling. They both have heads turned by the lovely lady and the battle of good and evil continues. The key to the action is the need to get the entire town/valleys cattle past all the rustlers up to the railroad at Abilene. Dan is falsely accused of taking a shot at Tod, but he is dragged by cattle, then shot by Doc Thorpe, the towns dentist. Tod shields Mikes eyes from the sight of the body. Ultimately, the two of them end up back herding cattle together.
