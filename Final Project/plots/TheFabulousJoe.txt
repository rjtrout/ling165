Milo Terkel has been asked for a divorce by his wife Emily and he explains to a judge why, including that its partially the fault of his dog Joe. The trouble began one night when Milo bought Emily an expensive piece of jewelry, only to discover she wont be home for dinner. He goes out to eat, taking Joe with him, and the suitably named Gorgeous Gilmore spots the jewelry and admires it. Jealousy ensues after Emilys freeloading brother George Baxter begins to meddle, making it appear Milos seeing another woman. Joe the dog doesnt help matters, causing Gorgeous to fall into a pond, causing Milo to take her home and replace her dress. Then the new dress gets ripped from Gorgeous by angry boyfriend Louie. By the time Milo is done telling how many different ways Joe has intervened and that the dog is even talking to him, the judge is ready to sentence him to a sanitarium. Emily takes pity and takes him away for a fresh start to their marriage instead.
