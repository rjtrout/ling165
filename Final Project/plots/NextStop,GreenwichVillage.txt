The film takes place in 1953. Larry Lipinsky is a young Jewish boy from Jewish enclave Brownsville Brooklyn, New York, who has dreams of stardom. He moves to Greenwich Village, much to the chagrin of his extremely over-protective mother. Larry ends up hanging out with an eccentric bunch of characters, while waiting for his big break. He has a group of tight-knit friends, which includes a wacky girl named Connie; Anita, an emotionally distraught young woman who constantly contemplates suicide; Robert, a young WASP who fancies himself a poet; and Bernstein, a gay man. All the while, he tries to maintain a stormy relationship with Sarah, his girlfriend. This band of outsiders becomes Larrys new family as he struggles as an actor and works toward a break in Hollywood.
