As the lead actress, Britton was the protagonist child of an American father and Spanish mother, Dones Jose and Zara Montalvo, as portrayed by Victor Kilian and Cecil Weston who is credited as Cecile Weston. The Montalvo family possessed land rights or Spanish land grants to a hacienda with gold mines present. Abroad, the daughter came home to California and witnessed her parents being murdered by Hank (John Merton) and an unknown man, Sheriff Jim Harden, who was played by Barton MacLane. Montalvo initially approached Harden about the crimes but eventually recognized him as part of murderers gang. She teamed up with Phillip Reed, in the role of Joaquin Murietta, to regain her rightful inheritance. Together they assumed false identities with Montalvo hidden behind the alias of a Zorro-like character named Lola Belmont with Murietta as Carlos del Rio. Dan Hinsdale (Willard Parker), who was an attorney, later informed her about his purchase of her familys rancho at a reduced fee because of back taxes owed by Montalvos parents. Montalvo sought the aid of Father Antonio (Martin Garralaga), who along with Murietta, is one of the few people to know their double identities. Antonio warned her that her outlaw gang was wanted by the Spanish authority and its soldiers. Upon learning this, Belmont and del Rio furtively worked to regain stolen gold and "land rights" on the behalf of other neighboring rancheros.
