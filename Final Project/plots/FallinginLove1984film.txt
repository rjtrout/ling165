While Christmas shopping for their respective families, architect Frank Raftis (De Niro) and graphic artist Molly Gilmore (Streep) bump into each other in a bookstore. When they arrive home they both notice that they have interchanged one of their holiday gift books, in fact the book they intended for their respective spouses. They meet again one morning a few months later on the commuter train to Central Station in Manhattan. What starts as a pleasant chance acquaintance blossoms into romance. Inevitably, both parties realize that even casual smooching is wrong. Sadly, their marriages dont appeal to them either. Finally, a somewhat bittersweet resolution is revealed one year later.
