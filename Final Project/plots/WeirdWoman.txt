Professor Norman Reed (Chaney, Jr.) falls in love with and marries an exotic woman named Paula (Gwynne) while on vacation in the South Seas. When they return to his home town, she is greeted coolly by much of the community, especially Ilona (Ankers), who felt that Reed was hers. Strange things begin to happen, including the death of a colleague, which turns people against her even more, especially as she believes in voodoo and other supernatural phenomena. Reed must work hard to prove her innocence and find the real culprit behind the strange doings. There are several women who act weird in this movie. Its difficult to say definitely which one is the "weird woman" of the title. Besides his wife and previous girl friend, there are female college students who want to spend time with Professor Reed.
