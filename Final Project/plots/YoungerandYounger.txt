Jonathan Younger owns a self-storage facility. He has a strained relationship with wife Penny, a plain and skittish woman who is startled by a noise Jonathan makes and dies from a heart attack. Jonathans college-aged son Winston returns home to help run the family business. While they interact with a number of quirky customers, Jonathan is haunted by the spirit of his late wife, who becomes increasingly attractive to him with each ghostly apparition.
