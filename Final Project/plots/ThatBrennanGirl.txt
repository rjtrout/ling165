On Mothers Day, 1946, a woman known as Ziggy Brennan looks back on her life. Eight years earlier, her vain and corrupt mother Natalie asks Ziggy to pretend they are sisters. Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a soldiers watch that Denny admires. The watchs inscription gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy gives it back to Mart Neilson, the soldier. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage and imminent motherhood. Mart, however, is killed in the war. Ziggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help, either. Ziggy likes to go out every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. Martha nearly dies from an accident. A landladys testimony results in the baby being sent to an orphanage. Ziggy attacks the landlady, complicating her life more. By the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned child, caring for it. Together, they appeal to a court for a second chance, then leave together united as a family.
