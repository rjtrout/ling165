Vilma Banky portrays a newly arrived Hungarian immigrant who learns to accustom herself to the new and strange life she finds in New York. The story gave Miss Banky moments of comedy and pathos. First seen as a frightened little peasant muffled in countless petticoats and shawls --- then in a neat waitresss uniform as she flips hotcakes in a restaurant window.
