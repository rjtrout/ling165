The scene opens where the passenger train, hauled by No. 1373, a 4-6-2 engine, being an American Pacific type steam engine, with a coal tender, and hauling a baggage car and three coaches, pulls into the station. Stan and Ollie are musicians, who are travelling by train to their next gig in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, a very popular vaudeville performance location at the time. They manage to hop on board, but Ollie is annoyed that Stan left the music behind. They antagonize a very short man (Sammy Brooks) when they sat on him. By entering a private car looking for their berth and frightening a woman who is dressing for bed, they anger her husband who, coming out and seeing a man who had nothing to do with the intrusion, rips his coat. The man, seeing another innocent man, proceeds to tear up his coat. This leads to a tit for tat of clothes tearing with one done off-screen. Stan and Ollie spend most of the trip trying to change into pajamas and get comfortable in a cramped upper berth. By the time Laurel & Hardy manage to sort themselves out, the train has reached their stop, and in their hurry to get off, they leave their musical instruments behind. The clothes tearing battle has, by now, involved the whole train, and the conductor manages to get stripped to his underwear and some rags trying to get through. Hardy closes the film by furiously chasing Laurel and throwing a rock at him.
