Foreign correspondent Jeff Seabrooks prolonged absences are frustrating his musician wife Julia so much, she is planning a divorce. Jeff hasnt told her he is on his way home. Julia hasnt told him she is leaving him, with orchestra manager David Torrance and music critic Philip Barrows both already wooing her. Jeffs newspaper editor John Girard advises him to act as if he accepts her decision. Julia tries to concentrate on her music, playing in an all-girl band (due to the war), which new conductor Anton Ottaway resents, feeling the music is too low-brow. Although temporarily off-duty from his job, Jeff is suddenly called up for active military duty. He takes Julia against her will to a remote cabin, forcing her to think about her decision to get a divorce, angering her suitors, who believe shes gone off with her husband deliberately. Jeff doesnt tell Julia hes going off to do his duty for Uncle Sam, but she takes him back anyway.
