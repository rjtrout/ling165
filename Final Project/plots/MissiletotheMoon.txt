Two escaped convicts, Gary (Tommy Cook) and Lon (Gary Clarke), are discovered hiding aboard a rocket by scientist Dirk Green (Michael Whalen), who then forces them to pilot the spaceship to the Moon. Dirk, who is secretly a Moon man, wants to return home. Dirks partner Steve Dayton (Richard Travis) and Steves fianc√©e June (Cathy Downs) are accidentally trapped aboard just before the rocketship blasts off from Earth. Moon man Dirk is later accidentally killed in a meteor storm during the lunar trip. Once they land on the Moon, the spaceships reluctant crew encounter deception and intrigue when they discover an underground kingdom made up of beautiful women and their sinister female ruler, The Lido (K. T. Stevens). While on the Moon, they encounter surface-dwelling, slow-moving, bipedal rock creatures that try to kill them, and must contend with a cave-dwelling giant spider.
