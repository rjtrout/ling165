Protagonist Kelley Bennett (Lucinda Dickey) is a young dancer training under the supervision of a traditionalist choreographer, Franco (Ben Lokey). Through her friend Adam, Kelley is introduced to two street dancers, Ozone (Adolfo Shabba Doo Qui√±ones) and Turbo (Michael Boogaloo Shrimp Chambers) on the boardwalk at Venice Beach. Kelley becomes enamored with their dancing and becomes friendly with the men, dancing and talking with them. Eventually, after dancing together the three form a team. Kelley eventually leaves her studio as her choreographer as he does not respect breakdancing and makes unwanted advances on her. Later, Kelley attends a dance audition and is shut down by harsh directors. Kelley then wanders to a breakdancing event where she finds Ozone and Turbo in the midst of a dance battle that they eventually lose against rivals "Electro Rock". Ozone is very defeated and is consoled by Kelley and she convinces him and Turbo to enter a dance competition. Kelleys agent friend James (Christopher McDonald), sees what the group can do and agrees to back them. However, the group is technically not allowed to perform in the dance audition because they only want "respected" forms of dance. Kelley and the crew dress up in black tie clothes to fool the judges and then start their auditon. When the judges see their breakdancing they are initially shocked and disapproving. However, the three eventually win over the judges and are chosen from the audition. The group goes on to be popular, remain friends, and dance in the community.
