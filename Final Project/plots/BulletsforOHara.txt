Offered the home of her well-to-do friends the Standishes for her Florida honeymoon, newlywed Patricia Van Dyne is astonished when her husband Tony promptly robs the place. Tony forces her to go along on a train bound for Chicago, then abandons Pat before the waiting police led by Mike OHara can nab him. OHara arrests her, skeptical of Pats claim that she had nothing to do with the theft. Once she is cleared of the charges, Pat immediately seeks a divorce from Tony. A scheme is hatched, Mike pretending to marry Pat himself to lure Tony out of hiding. Tony lets them go through with the wedding, then snatches Pat and Mike and takes them to the Florida Keys. Pat is able to have a note delivered to the police, who come to her rescue. Mike apologizes for the confusion and says he will quickly grant her a divorce. Pat says that wont be necessary.
