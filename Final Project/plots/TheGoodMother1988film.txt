Anna Dunlap (Keaton), is a piano teacher who works part-time at a college laboratory and a recent divorcee who has custody of a six-year-old daughter, Molly (Asia Viera). She meets and falls in love with Leo (Neeson), an Irish sculptor who helps her to find true passion and fulfillment. But her sexual liberation comes at a very high cost: her ex-husband Brian (James Naughton) questions her new lifestyle. Worse, he accuses Leo of sexually molesting Molly and sues Anna for custody of their daughter.
