Fields plays a hot-tempered dentist who terrorizes his patients, who verbally/physically abuses his assistants and golfing-caddies alike, and whose daughter desires to marry an ice-delivery man. Fields disapproves of this match, especially after the starry-eyed daughter attempts to elope with her lover. Fields locks his daughter in her upstairs bedroom which is located above his dental office, where she proceeds to stamp her feet, causing plaster chunks to fall as he attempts to treat his patients. Various patients with unusual physical traits (a tall "horse"-faced woman, a tiny, heavily-bearded man [Fields is obliged to use a stethoscope to locate the mans mouth]) arrive at the office, and he attempts to use his dental drill on them without any apparent pain killer. With one of his patients (Elise Cavanna), he engages in an intimate wrestling match as he attempts to extract a painful tooth. Eventually the ice-delivery man procures a tall ladder and aids the dentists daughter to escape from her dormitory window. Fields observes the lovers just as they are prepared to run off, and --- under pressure from the sizable crowd that has gathered at the foot of the ladder --- grudgingly withdraws his opposition to the match. The film ends with Fields --- who had previously threatened to purchase an electric refrigerator instead of ordering ice each day --- contemptuously ordering his now-future-son-in-law to "deliver ten pounds of ice, and be quick about it", prompting the daughter to joyfully embrace her fiance.
