Beau Clemment, a singer in New York City, learns that he has inherited a riverboat once owned by his grandfather, Beauregard, who had won it from its captain, Thaddeus Jackson, in a game of chance. Jackson has been bitter ever since, his old acquaintance Humphrey Hepburn recalling how Beauregard also won the heart of the vessels star performer, Melissa Curry. Beau travels to Alabama to claim the boat, which he finds in something far less than ship-shape condition. Unsure whether to scrap it or sell whats left of it, Beau meets singer Sally Jane Jackson, granddaughter of Thaddeus, and they develop a mutual attraction. He elects to restore the vessel and launch it with entertainment and gambling. He even recruits Thaddeuss singing butler, William, to perform aboard ship. Thaddeus objects to his ownership and presence, doing everything in his power to scuttle the venture. By the time the law catches up to it, Beaus boat has sailed into Georgia, out of its jurisdiction. Thaddeus, finally accepting the situation, is given a 50-50 interest in the boat with Beau, who is about to wed Sally Jane and become a part of the family.
