Aiden (Josh Lawson) is an underpaid and lonely freelance crime scene photographer who copes with the world around him by imagining himself as a hero who saves the day. His world is turned upside down when he meets Virginia (Emma Lung), who breathes new life into his daily routine and gives him a new sense of confidence. This gives him the courage to make his daydreams into a reality, which comes with some negative repercussions as Aidens sense of justice might be considered warped. He accidentally kills Ravi (Edward Furlong), Virginias boyfriend, and by making it look as though a junky killed him makes the ultimate effort to gain Virginia.
