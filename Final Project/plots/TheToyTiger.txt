New York City advertising executive Gwen Harkinson is a widow with a son, Timmy, who lives full-time in an upstate boarding school. She sends art director Rick Todd in that direction to try to rehire Mike Wyman, a former creative talent for the ad agency who has given up that life to become a sculptor. At school, Timmy has been lying to classmates that his father is not only alive but a famous big-game hunter and explorer. Many doubt him. Timmy compounds his tall tale by insisting his fathers on his way for a visit this very minute. When he sees Rick arrive in town, he pretends thats his Dad. Rick ignores him until his assistant Larry Tripps meets the boy and accuses Rick of abandoning his own child. A puzzled Rick confronts young Timmy and insists he reveal the truth, but at the last minute, Rick cant bring himself to see the kid humiliated. Mike not only refuses to return to advertising but inspires aspiring painter Rick to follow in his footsteps. Rick also goes camping with the students and pretends to be a great outdoorsman. Gwen visits and goes into a panic when told by the Fusenots, who run the school, that Timmys off with his "father." Once the confusion is worked out, Rick announces his intention to quit. Gwen, however, suddenly realizes that right in front of her eyes all along has been a perfect husband for her and father for her son.
