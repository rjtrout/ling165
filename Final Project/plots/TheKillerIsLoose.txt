An employee of a savings and loan company successfully robs a bank as an inside job. At first, bank employee Leon Poole (Wendell Corey) is considered a hero during the bank robbery, but the police quickly figure out hes involved in the crime. The cops catch up with Poole and his young wife at their apartment. Pooles wife is accidentally shot to death during a gunfight. Poole is arrested, convicted and sent to prison for the robbery. While behind bars, Poole plans his escape and revenge on the policeman who killed his wife, Lt. Sam Wagner (Joseph Cotten). Poole figures the best way to exact revenge is to kill Wagners wife, Lila (Rhonda Fleming). Poole escapes while working on a prison honor farm, murdering a guard. He kills again to gain access to a truck. Managing to avoid a highway roadblock set up by the police, Poole heads for the home of his former Army sergeant, Otto Flanders, holding his wife captive and then killing Flanders in cold blood. Wagners wife is unaware that she is Pooles target. Wagner manages to get Lila safely out of town, but because she resents her husbands unwillingness to quit law enforcement, she decides to leave him for good. Lila then learns he was merely trying to protect her, so she heads back for their home, where Poole is waiting.
