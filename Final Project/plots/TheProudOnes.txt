Cass Silver (Robert Ryan), marshal of a small Kansas town, is expecting trouble with the arrival of the first Texas trail herds on the newly completed railroad. The townâ€™s new saloon owner, Honest John Barrett (Robert Middleton) is anticipating an increase in business and wants rid of the marshal. To make matters worse, the marshals deputy, Thad Anderson (Jeffrey Hunter), is the son of a gunfighter that Cass shot years before. Eventually Thad begins to realise the truth about his father and helps the marshal restore law and order to the town.
