Twin sisters Skipper and Patricia Hughes are new students at a college where homecoming soldiers Bob Watson and Rick Adams intend to enroll. Unable to find lodging required for enrollment, the foursome is invited by Bessie Ormsbee, a WAC, to take up residence in a veterans housing facility, mistakenly believing them to be two married couples. Bessie and husband Busby are in charge of the housing facility, which is opposed by Senator Hughes, uncle of the twins, who is trying to curb government funding. Trouble also ensues when their nephew Junior begins to suspect the four arent married, and the sweethearts of Skipper and Bob show up on campus. Bob proposes a marriage of convenience to Skipper, who declines, even though shes fallen in love with him. Senator Hughes, discovering the arrangement, points out that due to common-law marriages, the girls and guys are already legally husbands and wives. All four happily decide to keep it that way.
