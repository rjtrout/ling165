Carol Williams (played by Sally Forrest) is a beautiful young dancer with a promising career, struck down with and crippled by polio. Williams dance partner and fianc√©, Guy Richards (played by Keefe Brasselle), wants to see her through her illness, but Carol struggles with dealing with her recovery and prefers to go it alone. Her father (played by Herb Butterfield) takes her to the Kabat-Kaiser Institute for rehabilitation, where she meets fellow patients in recovery. One of the patients that inspire Carols recovery is Len Randall (Hugh OBrian in his first movie role). Only by allowing others to share her grief is Ms Williams able to pull herself together and go on with her life.
