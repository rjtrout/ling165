Williamsburg, 1753. Hannoc, a young prince of the Deleware, agrees to ally himself with the British against the French who are encroaching south from Canada. A French spy Elizabeth Leeds does everything she can to seduce Hannoc and prevent him from bringing his people into the war on the British side. However, despite the appeals of his son, Hannocs father Shingiss attempts to maintain neutral. Shingiss is disturbed that Hannoc has become too anglicised and abandoned native ways, including his rejection of his intended Delaware bride Morna. Eventually a French attack on their lands drive the Delewares into formal alliance with the Crown, and they arrive just in time to assist the beleaguered colonial garrison under George Washington at Fort Necessity.
