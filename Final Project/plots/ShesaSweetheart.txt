A woman known to all simply as "Mom" runs a canteen where soldiers in particular are welcome. Maxine is a singer at the club and has stolen the heart of one of Moms favorite young men, Rocky, who is about to return to active duty. Mom keeps an eye on several couples. Frances is jealous because Jimmy has asked her to help him compose love letters. Jeannie is unaware that the soldier she loves, Paul, has returned from the war. Paul was honorably discharged with an injury but is reluctant to be loved by Jeannie out of pity. Rocky was unhappy when he left after being led to believe Maxine was leading him on all along. He is reported missing in action, causing Maxine and Mom to both miss him terribly. Frances is delighted to learn that those love letters were for her. When she and Jimmy are wed, Jeannie is shocked to find Paul there and they are reunited. At a party honoring the troops, a sad Maxine, while singing to the men, looks up and is thrilled to see Rocky.
