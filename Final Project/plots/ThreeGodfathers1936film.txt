In a town called New Jerusalem, bandits Bob Sangster (Chester Morris), Doc Underwood (Lewis Stone) and Gus Barton (Walter Brennan) hold up a bank. After a gun battle with the townspeople, the three robbers retreat into the scorching desert. There, they happen upon an ill woman stranded with her child. As the mother dies, she begs the men to take care of her infant. The fugitives want to save the baby -- but to do so, theyll have to travel back to New Jerusalem, where they are wanted men.
