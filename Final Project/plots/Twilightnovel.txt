A somewhat inexperienced and shy girl, Bella is dismayed by several boys competing for her attention. As Bella walks into the class, a fan blows her scent towards a mysterious man named Edward Cullen. Bella sits next to Edward in biology class on her first day of school, but he seems repulsed by her, affecting her feelings in the process. He disappears for a few days, but warms up to Bella upon his return; their newfound relationship is interrupted after Bella is nearly struck by Tylers van in the school parking lot.
