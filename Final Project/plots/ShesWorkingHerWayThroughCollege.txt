Angela Gardner (Virginia Mayo) is an exotic dancer who decides to improve her mind; she enrolls in a college where Professor John Palmer (Ronald Reagan) teaches English. There is an old rivalry between the bookish Palmer and onetime college football jock Shep Slade (Don DeFore). When the college trustees oppose Angelas presence on campus, Palmer staunchly defends her right to an education.
