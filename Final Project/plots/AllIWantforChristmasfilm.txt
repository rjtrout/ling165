In New York City, siblings Ethan (Ethan Randall) and Hallie OFallon (Thora Birch) launch a hilarious scheme to get what they most want for Christmas with their parents, Catherine (Harley Jane Kozak) and Michael (Jamey Sheridan), and grandmother, Lillian (Lauren Bacall). When Hallie meets Santa Claus (Leslie Nielsen), she asks for an unusual gift: her parents back together again. As the children embark on their adventure, and while planning ahead, Tony Boer (Kevin Nealon) takes an interest in Catherine. Ethan gets pre-occupied with not only his parents romantic dilemma, but also his own, one brought about by his new friendship with Stephanie (Amy Oberer). An elaborate scheme evolves with mice, telephone calls, and an ice cream truck, as Ethan and Hallie try to achieve their goal for helping Stephanie, and see Tony as the primary obstacle. They succeed with a little Christmas magic from Santa Claus. Catherine decides to reject Tony and remarry Michael, completing Hallies wish. Stephanie and Ethan talk one more time as she gives him a kiss; they began a relationship, and everyone lives happily ever after.
