Roberta Baxter wants to be an actress. Without telling her, husband Bill financially backs a stage play shes been cast in, secretly hoping for a flop so that Roberta will give up acting and return home. Getting his wish, the play flops. Bills scheme, however, is revealed to Roberta by theater director Tony Linnard, who wants her (and her money) for his next production. Bill blurts out that Roberta is not a talented actress, causing her to demand a divorce. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Bill has begun looking after a young girl, Sally, at the request of her father, a struggling tattoo artist who is away seeking suitable employment. Roberta mistakenly believes her husband has a mistress with a child. She disguises herself as a governess called Fleurette and is hired, unaware that Bill has recognized her. Roberta develops affection for the child, but then Terry returns and he, too, believes Bill has taken up with another woman. The complications are eventually resolved, and when Fleurette is revealed to be Roberta in disguise, Bill compliments her on what a fine actress she is.
