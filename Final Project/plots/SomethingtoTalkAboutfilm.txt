Grace (Julia Roberts) discovers that her husband, Eddie (Dennis Quaid), is having an affair with another woman. To her surprise, she also discovers that people around her advise her to forgive and forget instead of making an issue out of it. She doesnt agree, and takes her young daughter back to her parents ranch to live in a cabin with her sister, Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick), who is furious at Eddie and lets him know it. Her father (Robert Duvall) owns a hunter/jumper horse farm and thinks that they should instead concentrate on an upcoming competition.
