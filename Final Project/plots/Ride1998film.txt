New York City film school graduate Leta Evans (De Sousa) has just become the assistant to hot music video director Bleau Kelly (Downtown Julie Brown). She almost loses the job before her first days barely even started when Bleau decides budget cuts must be made for her next project. When Leta offers to do the assignment for a smaller fee, Bleau decides to have her escort a group of rappers, singers, and showbiz wanna-bes to Miami for a video shoot. The gang, which is kept in line by Poppa (Yoba), gets acquainted on a decaying bus as they travel down the East Coast, encountering barroom fights and other problems en route to the video gig.
