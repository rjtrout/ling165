Jim Smith (Lucien Littlefield), a millionaire due to his Bible publishing business, is married to the overly frugal Sue (Louise Fazenda). They desire to teach their ward Nanette (Bernice Claire) to be a respectable young lady; she, in turn, has an untapped wild side. Nanette wants to have some fun in Atlantic City, while she is being pursued by Tom Trainor (Alexander Gray). With so much unspent income at his disposal, Jim decides to become the benefactor for three beautiful women, but soon realizes his good intentions are bound to get him in trouble. He enlists his lawyer friend Bill (Bert Roach) to help him discreetly ease the girls out of his life. Sue and Billys wife, Lucille (Lilyan Tashman), learn about the women and assume their husbands are having affairs with them. Eventually, Bill and Jim explain the situation and are forgiven by their wives. Likewise, Nanette and Tom sort out their difficulties and decide to get married.
