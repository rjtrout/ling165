"Territory of East Africa 1903". In the British colonial region adjoining German East Africa (a portion of which was referenced as Tanganyika), tough American colonist John Gale (Van Heflin) is leading a safari to bring in escaped murderer Abel McCracken (Jeff Morrow), who is stirring up the (fictional) Nukombi tribe and endangering Gales holdings. En route, he picks up four survivors of a Nukombi raid: Dan Harder (Howard Duff), former teacher Peggy (Ruth Roman), and the two orphaned children of her brother who was killed in the raid. Harder is secretly McCrackens brother, while Galeâ€™s motives however have nothing to do with justice or even the charms of Peggy; he hopes to stake a claim on a valuable piece of land. The Nukombi are lying in wait and, eventually, Gale and McCracken meet in man-to-man combat.
