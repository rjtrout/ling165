The last thing Collier "Collie" Lang wants to do is get married, but Marita "Killer" Connell has other ideas. Collier, a confirmed bachelor, still lives with his mother, a high-powered attorney. When he is unexpectedly called up by the U.S. Army reserve with the rank of captain, Collier is given a peculiar assignment. Superior officer Colonel Head, cooperating with law enforcement, tells Collier about a jewel heist and how one of the gems has been spotted in a perfume ad, worn by Marita, a young actress. There is suspicion that a jewel thief who loves Marita gave her this stolen item, not telling her where or how he got it. Colliers odd assignment is to romance the young lady. Pretending to be a survey taker, he makes her acquaintance at a Beverly Hills hotel where Marita is immediately smitten. So much so that she insists on meeting his mother, crashing Mrs. Laings party of distinguished guests in an altogether unsuitable outfit and offending them with the scent of her terrible perfume. Marita manages to coax Collier into driving her to Las Vegas to get married. He tries to stall, then finally blurts out that he has no intention of marrying Marita when the jealous jewel thief bursts in on them. Collier must fight off him, then Maritas chauffeur, then even a passing truck driver. A heartbroken and angry Marita wants nothing more to do with him, which is about the same time Collier realizes that he really has fallen in love with her.
