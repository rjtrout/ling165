Young lawyers Fred Palmer and Tom Reagan open an office down the hall from one occupied by L.T. Mitchell, who fronts a slot-machine operation run by Monk Walter, a brutal racketeer. Fred and Tom extend an invitation to a welcome party to Mitchell, who declines, but his stenographer Mildred Anderson accepts and quickly develops a romantic attraction to Fred. Trouble brews when Tom disapproves of the way Fred is representing guilty clients including Walter, who commits violent crimes as soon as hes back on the street. Fred does it to make money for the firm, but ultimately Tom breaks up the partnership to become district attorney and Mildred, after marrying Fred, also leaves. After the cold-blooded murder of Mitchell, a guilty conscience persuades Fred to change his ways, but Walter shoots him. Walter is killed during a police pursuit, Fred recovers in the hospital and Mildred returns to his side.
