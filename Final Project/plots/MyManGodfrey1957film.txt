The plot begins as a zany heiress uses and then takes pity on a man whom she believes to be homeless. She insists the man come home with her and gives him a job as the eccentric familys butlerâ€”much to the chagrin of her father, especially when it becomes clear the girl is falling in love with the fellow. The familys new butler, however, harbors a secret: he is actually as wealthy and, in fact, more well-born than are they.
