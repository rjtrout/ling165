Young David Balfour arrives at a bleak Scottish house, the House of Shaws, to claim his inheritance after his father. The house and land have been under the custodianship of his fathers brother, Ebeneezer Balfour, but on reaching adulthood, the land and property become Davids. Ebeneezer is having none of it, however, so he first tries to murder him, then has him kidnapped by sea captain Hoseason, with whom he has, "a venture for trade in the West Indies". David is shipped off to be sold as a slave in the Carolinas. Fortunately for the lad, he strikes up a friendship with Alan Breck, escaping from Prince Charles Edward Stuarts defeat at Culloden. Breck is in a cobble which is run down in the fog by Hoseasons ship and once aboard, asks Hoseason to take him to France. When Hoseason refuses, Breck offers him 60 guineas to put him down on Loch Linnhe. On discovering that Breck has a money belt full of Jacobite gold, Hoseason and his crew try to kill Breck, but he is forewarned by David and the two kill half a dozen of the crew before the others retreat. Hoseason offers terms to end the fighting, but the ship runs aground. Only Breck and Balfour appear to survive and they manage to get to land. They set out for Edinburgh, dodging the ruthless Redcoats. Numerous adventures follow as they meet up with Brecks family, friends and foes alike. These include Brecks cousin, James Stewart, and his daughter Catriona, with whom David falls in love.
