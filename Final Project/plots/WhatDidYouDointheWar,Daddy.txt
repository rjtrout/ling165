An outfit of U.S. soldiers is assigned to capture "Valerno", a village in Sicily, but upon arrival, they discover that the town has been expecting them and will willingly turn itself over to the Americans rule, provided they are permitted to complete a soccer match and a wine festival. Romance and frivolity ensue, as a reluctant, by-the-book Capt. Cash (Dick Shawn) is persuaded by easy-going Lt. Christian (James Coburn) to go along with the locals wishes. Mistaking the festival for an attack, Germans come to the Italians aide, but the Americans accidentally end up conquering all.
