The police led by Captain McVeigh and the Assistant District Attorney James J. Horton are baffled by the disappearances of several young girls with some being found dead. Intrepid female newspaper reporter Nora Pages investigations reveal a link between the girls and the Crescent School of Fine Arts owned by gangster King Peterson, who is using the school as a front for a recruiting center for his nightclub "entertainers". Things become more complex when Noras father is connected with Peterson and her boyfriend James Horton is photographed in embarrassing circumstances with a woman found murdered after the photo was taken.
