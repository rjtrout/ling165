Eddie Miller (Arthur Franz), a San Francisco delivery man, struggles with his hatred of women. Hes especially bothered by seeing women with their lovers. Miller knows he is disturbed and, out of despair, burns himself by pressing his right hand to an electric stove. The doctor treating him in an emergency room suspects he might need psychological help, but gets too busy to follow through. Miller begins a killing spree as a sniper by shooting women from far distances with an M1 carbine. Trying to be caught, he writes an anonymous letter to the police begging them to stop him. As the killings continue, a psychologist has the keys (early criminal profiling techniques) to finding the killer. The film is unusual in that its ending is completely non-violent, despite its genre and expectations raised throughout.
