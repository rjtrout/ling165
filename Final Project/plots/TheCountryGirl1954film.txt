In a theatre where auditions are being held for a new musical production, the director, Bernie Dodd, watches a number performed by fading star Frank Elgin and suggests he be cast. This is met with strong opposition from Cook, the shows producer. Bernie insists on the down-on-his-luck Frank Elgin, who is living in a modest apartment with his wife Georgie. They are grateful, though not entirely certain Frank can handle the work. Initially Frank leads Bernie to believe that Georgie is the reason for his career decline. Bernie strongly criticizes her, first behind her back and eventually to her face. What he doesnt know is that the real reason Franks career has ended is his insecurity. When their five-year-old son Johnny was hit by a car while in his care, Frank was devastated by the death and, partly using that as an excuse to cover up his insecurity, reduced to a suicidal alcoholic. Mealy-mouthed to the directors face, Frank is actually a demanding alcoholic who is totally dependent on his wife. Bernie mistakenly blames her for everything that happens during rehearsals, including Elgins requests for a dresser and a run-of-the-show contract. He believes Georgie to be suicidal and a drunk, when it is actually Frank who is both. Humiliated when he learns the truth, Bernie realizes that behind his hatred of Georgie was a strong attraction to her. He kisses her and falls in love. Elgin succeeds in the role on opening night. Afterward he demands respect from the producer that he and his wife had not been given previously. At a party to celebrate, Bernie believes that now that Elgin has recovered his self-respect and stature, Georgie will be free to leave him. But she stands by her husband instead.
