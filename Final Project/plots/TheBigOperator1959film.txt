Ruthless labor official "Little Joe" Braun is about to face questioning from a Senate committee. The night before, he sends a hit man, Oscar "The Executioner" Wetzel, to kill a witness named Tragg and steal incriminating documents in Traggs possession at a factory. Plant workers and friends Bill Gibson and Fred McAfee are accidental eyewitnesses to Wetzels presence at the crime scene. Braun pleads the Fifth Amendment during his Senate testimony and vehemently denies knowing the mob enforcer Wetzel. But with a perjury charge facing him, Braun is made aware that Gibson and McAfee could potentially put him behind bars. A reign of terror against the two men begins. They are harassed at work and then fired on false grounds. McAfee is set afire and nearly dies from the burns. Gibson and wife Mary panic after their son Timmy is taken captive. Gibson, who had been blindfolded in Brauns car, recreates and retraces with great difficulty the way to a hideout where Timmy is being held. He and the authorities cant find Braun or the boy and are about to give up when they spot Brauns cigar, still burning in an ashtray. They find him cowering in a closet with the boy, then drag him away to jail.
