Paul Aufiero (Patton Oswalt) is a parking garage attendant who lives with his mother (Marcia Jean Kurtz) in Staten Island, New York. He relentlessly follows the New York Giants football team. He and his friend Sal (Kevin Corrigan) faithfully attend each Giants game; however, as they cant afford tickets, they content themselves with watching the games on a battery-powered TV in the stadium parking lot. Paul is also a regular caller to the Sports Doggs (Scott Ferrall) radio talk show, where he refers to himself as "Paul from Staten Island," rants in support of the Giants, and berates his mysterious on-air rival, Philadelphia Eagles fanatic "Philadelphia Phil" (Michael Rapaport). Pauls family criticizes him for doing nothing with his life. He disregards their scorn and happily devotes himself to his beloved team. One day Paul and Sal spot Giants star and Pauls favorite player Quantrell Bishop (Jonathan Hamm) and his entourage in Staten Island. They follow Bishop to a drug deal in Stapleton. Though the pair see Bishop buying something, they naively fail to recognize the transaction. Paul and Sal then follow Bishop into a strip club in Manhattan where they eventually introduce themselves. All goes well until the two fans innocently mention that they saw Bishop in Stapleton. Bishop becomes enraged and brutally beats Paul, who wakes up in a hospital. Following the incident, Bishop is suspended from the team. Pauls personal-injury lawyer brother Jeff (Gino Cafarelli) and NYPD Detective Velardi (Matt Servitto) pressure Paul to bring charges against Bishop, but Paul refuses, worried about the effect on the Giants performance if they lose their star linebacker. The charges against Bishop are eventually dropped and he returns to the team. Jeff then files a $77 million civil lawsuit against Bishop as Pauls legal guardian, claiming Paul is mentally incompetent and cant bring the lawsuit himself. When a reporter phones Paul to ask him "about the lawsuit," Paul becomes livid and confronts Jeff as he sits on the toilet. Both Jeff and Pauls mother start to pressure Paul to get mental help. Philadelphia Phil researches Paul on the Internet and reveals on Sports Doggs show that the victim of the Quantrell Bishop beating is in fact "Paul from Staten Island", humiliating him. Paul heads for Philadelphia to confront Phil. Disguised as an Eagles fanatic, Paul identifies Phil in a local bar and gains his trust as they watch the Giants and Eagles play the seasons pivotal final game. As the Eagles dominate the Giants, the crowd in the bar begins to deride the Giants in increasingly enthusiastic fashion, much to Pauls consternation. When time runs out and the Eagles fanatics celebrate their victory, Paul follows Phil into the mens room and pulls a gun on him, shooting Phil multiple times. Phil, lying shocked on the mens room floor, stares at his hands, which are now covered in red and blue, the Giants colors. The gun is then revealed to be a paintball gun. Paul utters "Eagles suck!" and flees from the bar. Paul is arrested and imprisoned for the assault. Sal visits Paul in jail and reveals to him the Giants schedule for the following season. A key game coincides with the week Paul is scheduled to be releasedâ€”Paul is overjoyed and says "Its going to be a great year".
