The story concerns Italian-American U.S. Army Major Joppolo, who is placed in charge of the fictional town of Adano during the invasion of Sicily. The title refers to Major Joppolos attempts to replace the 700-year-old bell that was taken from the town by the Fascists at the start of the war to be melted down for ammunition. Through his actions, Joppolo also wins the trust and love of the people. Some of the changes Joppolo brings into the town include: Democracy Free fishing privilege The freedom of mule carts A bell from the American Navy to replace the town bell The short-tempered American commander, General Marvin, fires Major Joppolo from his position when Joppolo disobeys an order to prohibit mule cart traffic in Adano, which has been disrupting Allied supply trucks, because the mule carts are vital to the survival of the town. The character of Joppolo was based on the real life experiences of Frank Toscani, who was military governor of the town of Licata, Sicily after the Allied invasion.
