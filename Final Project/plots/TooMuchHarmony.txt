A backstage musical about a Broadway star, Eddie Bronson, who is stranded with his plane in Ohio where he discovers a small-time variety act, Dixon and Day and their assistant Ruth who is also Ben Days fiancée. When he returns to New York following a try-out of a new show, Bronson arranges for the irascible producer, Max Merlin, to put them in the show and the story develops around the mutual interest which grows between Eddie and Ruth. At a party Bronson sings The Day You Came Along and his own fiancée, Lucille, is jealous of his attentions to Ruth. Rehearsals of the show prove to be disappointing but Eddie encourages Ruth and they sing Thanks. Ben decides to give up Ruth so that she can marry Eddie but Lucille will not release Eddie. Ben, with Johnnys help, masquerades as a tobacco millionaire, Charles W. Beaumont Jr., and pretends to be infatuated with Lucille who, in her enthusiasm to obtain a millionaire husband, abandons Eddie and tells him she is breaking the engagement which, of course, has the desired effect of leaving him free to marry Ruth. The opening night is a huge success; the show includes a spectacular production number, Black Moonlight, sung by one of the leading ladies standing on a bridge while dancers perform on a huge draped drum. Other featured numbers are Dixon and Days The Kellys and the Cohens, Cradle Me with a Hocha Lullaby, Boo-boo-boo and the finale Buckin the Wind. The song I Guess It Had To Be That Way was omitted from the released print of the film. Sam Coslow and Arthur Johnston also wrote Two Aristocrats for this film but it was not used. Kitty Kelly is seen singing Black Moonlight but the dubbed voice was actually that of Barbara Van Brunt. Although Crosby did not sing it in the film, and it may not have been the most tuneful of songs, his commercial recording is a prime example of his singing and style at that period.
