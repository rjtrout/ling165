Joe Turner (Cliff Robertson) returns to Great Britain twenty years after he ended a romantic relationship with Ann (Vanessa Redgrave). He discovers her running the same picturesque seaside resort in Dorset, but now with a grown daughter named Joanna (Susan George). The principal action of the film is the attempt of the adults to renew their relationship, with interference from the daughter, who flirts with Joe from the moment she meets him, successfully competing with her mother for his attention. Most of the film consists of conversations between the characters, mingled with shots of the nearby seashore. Days into Joes return, an argument with Ann results in him leaving, however he has a change of heart while walking to the train station and returns. Arriving back at the hotel, Joe unexpectedly discovers one of the women, later revealed to be Joanna, offering herself to him in his bedroom, and he wordlessly accepts her invitation. The following morning, Joe and Ann attempt continue their relationship, however the evening ends with Joanna revealing her and Joes affair. Ann responds by locking Joanna in her bedroom, while Joe agrees to leave for a few weeks and then come back to Ann. After Ann goes to bed, Joanna escapes out of her window, lets herself back into the hotel and finds Joe sitting alone downstairs. His initial attempts to send her back to her room fail and Ann soon catches the lovers in mid-coitus. She calmly informs Joe that she lied to him when he asked earlier who Joannas father was, and she said the father was deadâ€”the father was Joe. The next day, one of the women leave the seaside resort by train, while Joe stays with the other and talks about fixing the place up. He sits down to play cards with the remaining woman, who has no response, and whose face cant be seen. The films ending was purposely left ambiguous as the filmmakers felt it was unimportant which woman stayed with Robertson.
