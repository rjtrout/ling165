An axe murderer stalks Chicago. After six murders, the police identify six suspects, all of whom are lunatics not responsible for the crimes. Only one victim, socialite Edwina Brown (Laraine Day), has survived; she was rescued by actor Oliver Duffy (Lew Ayres). After a second attempt on Edwina, Oliver deduces that the crimes are not random. He believes that someone is hypnotizing different people to commit each murder, but his far-fetched hypothesis leaves the police and Edwina skeptical.
