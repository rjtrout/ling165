A group of individuals including the writer Rick (Walter Bigari), Daniel Parks (Alfredo Rizzo), his publisher, his secretary, Edith (Luisa Baratto), their photographer, Dermott (Ralph Zucker) and five young models enter a seemingly deserted castle to take photos for a horror photonovel. The castle is actually occupied by a former actor, Travis Anderson (Mickey Hargitay). Anderson initially desires to send the group away, but recognizes Edith (who was once his fianc√©e) and changes his mind, but places the dungeon as off limits for the group. The group ignores this warning and proceed to take photos there anyway. This angers Anderson, who dons a costume and takes the identity of the Crimson Executioner, who was hanged centuries earlier for the crime of having his own private torture chamber. Anderson eventually kills each member of the group until only Edith and Rick remain. Anderson succombs to his own torture devices and is killed by the poisoned barbs on the "Lover-of-Death" machine. Edith and Rick then escape with their lives.
