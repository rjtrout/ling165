After being rejected by his girlfriend, Peter Rooker decides to audition for a small role in an upcoming local community theatres production of "Cyrano de Bergerac". Despite the fact that Peter has no experience or skill as an actor, the director casts Peter as Cyrano, the lead. Peter soon becomes caught up in the various intrigues of the "theater people", including the charming but mercurial Michael Degan, the beautiful leading lady Grace Hargrove, and a cast of other eccentric players. Gradually, Peter discovers that in the world of theater the normal rules do not apply â€“ but in the end there is a role for everyone. As Peter struggles with his acting, it becomes clear that he is not going to be ready for opening night. An experienced, but universally disliked, actor (Sean Astin) is brought in to play Cyrano. Realizing the writing is on the wall, Peter asks the Director to let him relinquish the role and take another role as a background character. On opening night, the lead has not appeared, and the director asks Peter, who has never rehearsed the role, to play Cyrano. At first, he declines, but then realizing it is his dream, he plays Cyrano with great success.
