When the anxiously awaited posse returns with neither prisoners nor the stolen money, we learn through flashbacks from three different characters, what took place. Having been cheated by Sampson Drune, a father and his two sons have robbed him and fled. A posse led by Drune took off after them and although unwanted, the towns drunken Sheriff joined them. The Sheriffs influence on Jed, the adopted son of Drune, is the key to Jed later revealing who killed Drune, the robbers, and what happened to the money.
