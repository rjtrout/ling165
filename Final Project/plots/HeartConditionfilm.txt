Hoskins plays police sergeant Jack Moony, a bigoted cop; and Washington plays Napoleon Stone, an adorable but sleazy ambulance chasing lawyer who Moony hates. Moonys years of bad habits, such as overeating, smoking, and drinking, finally catch up with him. At the same time, Stone is gunned down in a drive-by shooting. After suffering a heart attack, Moony wakes up to find out that his new heart was once Stones, and the dead lawyers ghost has become his constant companion. Now, Moony will have to solve Stones murder.
