The film is set in the early 1900s. It tells the story of a pretty and independent young woman, Rae Smith, who lives in Cincinnati. She has many suitors, none of whom she takes seriously. One day she meets an extremely charming and handsome banker named Walter Louis Saxel, and they fall immediately into a strong attraction, which for her is real love. After a few days of closeness she is shocked when he tells her he is already engaged to someone else. Nonetheless the two of them very nearly marry one another on an impulse, but they are prevented from doing so by arbitrary external forces. After five years, they meet once again, by chance, in New York City. The banker is now married with two children (Richard and Elizabeth) and is extremely successful in his career, but Rae and he still share the same strong attraction. Rae loves him so much that she gives up her career in dress design and becomes his kept mistress, seeing him only when it is convenient for him. Walter keeps up the appearance of a "happy marriage" and never considers divorcing his wife, whose father is his boss at the banking company. Raes loyalty to Walter collapses only once, when he fails to contact her after he has been on an extended trip to Europe with his wife. Rae goes back to Ohio and agrees to marry Curt, an attractive and good-hearted man who proposed to her many times in their youth. However, Walter travels to Ohio to find her, and is able to persuade her to return with him. Once Walters children reach adulthood they understand who Rae is, and they despise her. People in Walters social circle also point condemning fingers at Rae, who suffers all this with patience and fortitude. In old age, dying of a stroke in his grand home, Walters last faltering word is to Rae, on the phone. She dies not long afterwards in her apartment.
