A promiscuous and rather misogynistic man, Steve (Perry King) is murdered by one of his three ex-lovers, and after death, the powers that be cannot decide whether to send him to heaven or to hellâ€”his life is full of good deeds, but he has "been a shit" to women, and that behavior is keeping him from going to heaven. The powers that be decide to give him a test; he is reincarnated and given a limited amount of time to have at least one woman like him. To make the test more difficult, he is reincarnated as a beautiful woman (Ellen Barkin); he calls himself Amanda as a joke. After the change, Amanda/Steve encounters other people, and rankles at being treated the way he treated women. Steves friend Walter, and lesbian perfume magnate Sheila both become attracted to Amanda, but Amanda rebuffs Sheilas advances, despite knowing that she is giving up an opportunity for a woman to love her, even though he had sex exclusively with women, as Steve, in the past. Later, Amanda and Walter get drunk together and he has sex with her while she is passed out. In the morning, Amanda has no memory of the sex and accuses Walter of raping her. Walter acts surprised and insists that Amanda was an enthusiastic participant. Steve realizes the sort of man that he used to be and the sort of man that Walter is. Amanda rejects Walter, but she learns shortly thereafter that she has become pregnant from the encounter. At the childbirth, the baby girl gazes at her mother with love, and Amanda dies, having earned [his] place in heaven.
