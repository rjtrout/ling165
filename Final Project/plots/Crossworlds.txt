College student Joe is drawn into a battle to save the world from arch-enemy Ferris. Joes heirloom pendant just happens to be the key to a sceptre that opens doors to the Crossworlds, another dimension. When Laura (Andrea Roth) shows up to check on the key and Ferris goons begin their assaults, they run to semi-retired adventurer A.T. (Rutger Hauer) for help and guidance.
