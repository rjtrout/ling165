Lieut. Bill Brannigan (Pat OBrien) invites friend and hotshot pilot Tommy OToole (James Cagney), the self-styled "worlds greatest aviator", to join the USMC Reserve Aviator training program. OToole arrives and promptly starts to move in on Brannigans love interest, Betty Roberts (Margaret Lindsay), and in typical cocky fashion, antagonizes nearly everyone else. Although not temperamentally suited for the military, OToole completes primary training and after surviving an accident, eventually realizes that he is willing to change. After a competition in the air with his friend Brannigan, and for the attentions of Betty, there is a predictable conclusion with OToole coming out the victor.
