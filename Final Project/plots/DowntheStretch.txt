Snapper Sinclairs father once rode for stable owners Patricia and Cliff Barrington, but later was found to have thrown races and was banned from the track. To keep Snapper from being sent to reform school, Patricia offers him a job. A fast but untamed horse called Faithful quickly becomes Snappers favorite. He wins races as its jockey, but when he refuses to throw one for gamblers, they reveal publicly who Snappers father was and suspicion falls on Snapper, who is no longer allowed any mounts. He leaves for England, where he becomes a very successful rider. One day the Barringtons are there to enter Faithful in a race. Snapper discovers that they are nearly broke. He deliberately loses the race so that Faithful can win. Not sure where to turn next, Snapper is pleased when the Barringtons invite him to come back home.
