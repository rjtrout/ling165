A wealthy alumnus of Carlton College promises to leave his fortune to the school, but only if it can defeat football rival State three consecutive years. After two victories in a row, the alumnus dies. His descendants want his money for themselves, and therefore desperately want Carlton to lose the big game. Ken Thomas is the star player for Carlton, but he is injured and a doctor has cautioned him that he risks permanent damage to his health if he plays. Ken has given his word to girlfriend Lucille that he wont play, but after she releases him from that promise, the rich benefactors relatives scheme to have Ken accused of stealing a car and placed under arrest. Campus friends come to his rescue just in time for Ken to suit up for Carlton and save the day.
