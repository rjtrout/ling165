In the cartoon, Pete Puma is trying to raid the henhouse Foghorn Leghorn is guarding; Foghorn decides to have some fun with Pete. He tells Pete what he really wants is a Venezuelan Racing Chicken which has unfortunately run back to Venezuela. Pete runs there and back in time. Next, he really wants an Irish Wrestling Chicken, which turns out to be a rope tied to a bulls tail (this bull resembles Toro from Bully for Bugs). When Pete makes off with a chicken, nest and all, Foghorn grabs the chicken, then says Petes found the rare Mongolian Disappearing Chicken, and the only way to make it reappear is tap dancing; Pete dances into a hole; Foggy drops an anvil on Petes head ("a whole lotta lumps!"). Foggy walks away, chuckling at his cleverness, when a genuine Irish Wrestling Chicken pins him ("Im glad I say Im glad I didnt show him the Norwegian Exploding Chicken"). During the cartoon, Foghorn tries to convince Pete to go hunting for rabbits to which Pete quickly and frantically declines ("uh-uh! No rabbits!"). This is most likely referencing Petes previous run in with Bugs Bunny during the cartoon Rabbits Kin.
