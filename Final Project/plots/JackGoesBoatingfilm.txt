Jack (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a shy limousine driver who lives with and works for his uncle. His best friend and co-worker Clyde (John Ortiz) and Clydes wife Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega) set up a dinner date at their house for him to meet Lucys new co-worker, Connie (Amy Ryan) who has some minor intimacy issues of her own. As Jack and Connie get to know each other, he sets his sights on learning to swim so he can take her boating when summer comes. With Clyde eager to help him learn, they begin swimming lessons. Jack decides that summer is too far away to wait for a date with Connie. He decides that a nice dinner would be a good place to start. When Connie says that no one has ever cooked a meal for her, Jack decides that he wants to be the chef and cook for her. This adds another set of lessons to be learned as Jack does not know how to cook. Clyde sets Jack up with a chef friend of Lucys to learn the culinary art form. As Jack strives to perfect swimming and cooking, he begins to get a look behind the veil of the marriage of his friends, which is straining under the weight of mutual occasional infidelities. As Jack and Connie grow closer, the troubles of his friends marriage become more apparent, and Jack grows in confidence and skill not just aquatically and in culinary arts, but in relating to Connie as well. The films last scene, with Clyde watching Jack and Connie going off happily, suggests that in fact Clyde wanted Connie himself - which would explain why he helped Jacks courting of her but on several occasions also tried to sabotage it.
