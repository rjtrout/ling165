Ann Lemp Borden (Priscilla Lane) has been recently widowed, after her husband Mickey Borden (John Garfield), a down and out and unlucky musical genius, is tragically killed in a car accident. She now lives at home again with her father (Claude Rains), Aunt Etta (May Robson) and younger sister Kay (Rosemary Lane). Her two other sisters, Emma and Thea, are married. Kay is dating a young doctor Clint Forrest Jr. (Eddie Albert); Emma and Thea are trying to conceive via their respective husbands. Ann, engaged to musical composer Felix Dietz (Jeffrey Lynn) suddenly discovers that she is pregnant with her deceased husbands child. Unable to forget Mickey, she vacillates on marrying Felix. A flashback shows Mickey playing an unfinished musical composition “that has only a middle…no beginning…no ending” and Ann finds herself frequently replaying the tune in her head or on her piano. Ann is distressed over the raw deal life had given Mickey. Felix eventually convinces Ann to marry him and they elope, but Ann is still caught up in the past tragedy. Felix finishes Mickey’s composition and conducts it nationally on radio, making a speech commemorating Mickeys genius and untimley death. Convinced now that Mickey Borden did not die in vain, Ann comes back to reality, rediscovers her love for husband Felix and together with her family goes on to have a normal happy life complete with her child, nieces and nephews.
