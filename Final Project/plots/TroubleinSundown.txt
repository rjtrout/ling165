A banker named Cameron is suspected of a robbery because he was the only person who knew the vault locks combination. When a corrupt land owner, Ross Daggett, tries to exact vigilante justice, rancher Clint Bradford goes to the aid of June Cameron, the bankers daughter, and hides her father. June inadvertently leads Daggett and his men, including hired gun Dusty, to her fathers hiding place, where Cameron is captured and taken back to town. Dusty is tricked by Clint into revealing a secret panel through which Daggett was able to view Camerons use of the vault combination. June is grateful to Clint when her father goes free.
