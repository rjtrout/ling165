Sam Carraclough, a miner who struggles to earn enough money to feed his family, sells the familys Collie, Lassie, to the Duke of Rudling, whose granddaughter loves the dog, leaving his young son, Joe heartbroken over the loss of his dog. The Dukes servant, Hynes, scares the dog, which keeps coming back so the Carracloughs have to keep returning her, and Hynes blames the boy. During the holiday season, the duke goes to the Scottish Highlands, taking Lassie. Lassie escapes and goes on a 500-mile journey to get home. Meanwhile, Sam Carraclough enlists in World War I to support his family. During her journey, Lassie dodges dog catchers and is taken by a circus performer (Peter Dinklage) and befriends his small dog. Later, after they are attacked by some men, which kill the small dog, an angered performer and Lassie chase the men away. Lassie reaches home on Christmas Day and faints outside the church in which the family is in. When the mass was over, the family found Lassie nearly dead and they take her home, the veterinarian tells the family that Lassie might not survive. When Hynes hears that Lassie has been found, he, accompanied by police officers, goes to the house to take Lassie and the family to the Dukes local estate. The duke lets the family keep Lassie by denying that it is his dog and fires Hynes. After Lassie recovers, the duke offers a job to Sam and his wife and a new house. The dukes granddaughter visits the family in their new house and sees Lassies puppies. She and Joe play with puppies and the movie ends.
