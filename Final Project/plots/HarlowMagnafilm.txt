Noticing a beautiful girl in the background of a Laurel and Hardy film, actor Marc Peters tips off studio mogul Jonathan Martin, who arranges a screen test. Jean Harlow is an overnight success. Harlow isnt a trained thespian and is mocked by experienced actor William Mansfield, but she is sexy and shes got something audiences respond to that makes her a Hollywood star. Unfortunately for her, shes also got a mother, Mama Jean, who quickly capitalizes on her daughters money and fame. Family and studio demands unnerve Harlow, as does her impulsive wedding to Paul Bern, who turns out to be impotent and suicidal. Harlow has many unhappy affairs and becomes depressed. But the veteran actress Marie Dressler persuades her to take her profession more seriously, so Harlow goes back East to study her craft. When she returns home, Hollywood mogul Louis B. Mayer is impressed, as is Mansfield, who also begins falling in love with her. Harlow, however, contracts a serious illness, and at the tender age of 26, she is gone.
