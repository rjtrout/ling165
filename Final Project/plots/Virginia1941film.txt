Having inherited a Virginia estate, Charlotte "Charlie" Dunterry, who has lived in New York all of her life, travels South to sell the 150-year-old property, only to find it in ramshackle condition. Charlie becomes acquainted with Stonewall Jackson "Stoney" Elliott and his young daughter, Pretty, who live with Stoneys cousin, Theo, in a modest home. Stoney is married but estranged from his wife, who is living in Europe and not in touch. Electing to remain in Virginia and restore the property to its former stature, Charlie develops feelings for Stoney, but his marital situation causes him to resist. A frustrated Charlie accepts a marriage proposal from wealthy Norman Williams, who then hides from her the knowledge that Stoneys wife is dead. Only on their wedding day does Normans conscience persuade him to tell Charlie the truth, allowing her to follow her heart.
