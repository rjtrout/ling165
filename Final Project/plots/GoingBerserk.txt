John Bourgignon (Candy) is an amiable chauffeur and would-be drummer who is engaged to the daughter (Mills) of an extremely disapproving United States congressman (Hingle). As the wedding date approaches, Bourgignons sleazy film-director friend (Levy) blackmails the senator into allowing him to record the ceremony, while Bourgignon runs afoul of a motorcycle gang and later finds himself kicked out onto the nighttime city streets while handcuffed to a dead man (Hudson). Worst of all, a local aerobics studio has become the front for an inept religious cult which has targeted the senator for assassination, and attempts to drug and brainwash Bourgignon into killing his future father-in-law during the wedding ceremony. In the end, with the questionable help of his even more hapless friend (Flaherty), Bourgignon more or less saves the day, and more or less lives happily ever after.
