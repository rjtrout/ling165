Gary and Bobby are two stock car drivers who grew up together and both love the same girl, Shelley. Fake newspaper articles by Georgina Clark start appearing highlighting a feud between them. At first Bobby and Gary ignore the reports but eventually the rivalry becomes genuine. It turns out Georgina is in cahoots with Maxwell Carstairs, manager of the racetrack, who has been hired by a syndicate to turn the sport into a lucrative gambling venture; the articles are to increase attendances. Bobbys mechanic, Bowswer Smith, exposes the truth. Bobby refuses to drive Carstairs car in the big race so Bowser replaces him and is killed. Bobby quits racing and settles down on a farm with Shelley. Gary becomes a champion stock car racer. Garys father marries Bobbys mother and Carstairs is arrested for embezzlement.
