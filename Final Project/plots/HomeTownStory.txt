Jeffrey Lynn plays a defeated politician who takes over as editor of a small town newspaper in an effort to get himself elected. His campaign is intended to be a continuing expose of the evils of big industry, and his strategy is to publish daily investigations of industrial skullduggery and pollution. Marilyn Monroe, listed as one of the films stars, actually plays a very small bit as Iris Martin, the shapely office secretary. On a school outing to an abandoned mine, Jeffrey Lynns little sister is trapped in the collapse of a mine tunnel, and the towns industries come to her rescue. After little sister is rescued and flown in a company plane to the big city, Lynn has a change of heart and recognizes that the industrial towns-people are actually doing their best to help their fellow citizens.
