Australian heiress Alexandra Hobarts (Emma Samms) father has disapproved of every boyfriend she has brought home to meet him, including her burly, life-of-the-party fianc√©, Bruce (Vernon Wells). After a disastrous birthday party, Alexandra decides to challenge her father (Terence Cooper) with the worst boyfriend she can find. She hires a down-on-his luck waiter from a Mexican restaurant in Sydney, Australia named Carlos (Cheech Marin) to masquerade as her new boyfriend to persuade her father into allowing her to marry Bruce. Needing the money to save the failing restaurant, Carlos agrees to the ruse; acting loud, belligerent and obnoxious, shocking everyone in the Hobart household and their high-society friends at a party with his crude behavior, warranting unwanted attention from Alexs eccentric cousin, Maggie (Jeanette Cronin) in the process. After a while however Alex discovers that in spite of his rather crass and unrefined ways Carlos is actually a very caring and sensitive person and she even finds herself falling for him. Alexs father, however, doesnt buy the act, and hires a detective to photograph Bruce and Alexs best friend, Dominique (Carole Davis) in a compromising position. Carlos gets wind of the infidelity and attempting to save Alexandra from being hurt ends up assaulted by Bruce. Alex outs Bruce and Dominique at a party before racing to the airport to mend fences with Carlos. Hoping shes not too late, Alex has the plane called back to the airport by her father. Realizing how noble Carlos is, Mr Hobart invests in Carlos restaurant thereby saving it from closing.
