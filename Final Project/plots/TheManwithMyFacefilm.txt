The film is set in Puerto Rico, where Charles "Chick" Graham (Nelson) has settled down after the war to run a small business with his old army buddy (now his brother-in-law) Buster Cox (Harvey). Graham comes home one evening to find his wife, Cora (Ainley), acting as if he is an insane stranger. A man who looks exactly like him, Albert "Bert" Rand (Nelson), has taken his place and is playing cards and drinking in his living room. Neither Cora nor Buster—not even Grahams dog—recognizes Graham; they think that he, rather than Rand, is the double. Meanwhile, his face has shown up on the front page of newspapers as a bank robber in Miami who made off with half a million dollars. As Graham runs from the police, he attempts to solve the mystery with the help of Mary Davis (Mathews), an old girlfriend whom he jilted to marry Cora. Marys protective brother, Walt Davis (Warden), is wary but soon joins Graham in trying to figure out the puzzle. Nash attempts to kill Graham by hiring an attack dog specialist to have a Doberman go after him. The evil double has been in on this sinister plan with Cora and her brother, Buster, since before the Grahams marriage.
