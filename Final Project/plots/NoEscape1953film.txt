The action is set in San Francisco and the film opens in a documentary style. When the evidence in a murder case points to a young woman as the main suspect, both her boyfriend, a police detective, and a struggling songwriter who is playing piano in a bar, decide to withhold evidence from the police. Later, the girl, knowing that the songwriter did not commit the murder, helps him to escape from a police dragnet when he becomes the main suspect. Eventually, new clues point to someone else as the culprit. Quite an entertaining thriller.
