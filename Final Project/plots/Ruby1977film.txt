In 1935, a lowlife mobster, Nicky Rocco, is betrayed and executed in the swampy backwoods as his pregnant gun-moll, Ruby Claire watches. He swears vengeance with his dying breath, and then she suddenly goes into labour. Sixteen years later in 1951, Ruby is now running a drive-in theatre in the backwoods near her home and employs some ex-mobsters. Her 16-year-old daughter, Leslie Claire, is mute and has been since birth. Soon strange and bizarre accidents claim the lives of Rubys employees, then Leslie begins to show strange behaviour, and then begins to speak... in her dead fathers voice. Nicky Rocco possesses his daughters body and terrorizes Ruby with levitations, telekinesis, maniacal laughing and bizarre sexual aggression.
