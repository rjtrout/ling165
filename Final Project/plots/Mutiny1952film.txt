During the War of 1812, Captain James Marshall has to run the blockade of the US coast being operated by the British, in order to collect a war loan obtained from France, which is being paid in gold bullion. His first mate is Ben Waldridge, a former Royal Navy captain who was cashiered by the Navy. Waldridge has his former gun crew along with him and, when they realize that there is gold coming on board, they plot mutiny. Leslie, Waldridges gold-loving former sweetheart, arrives at the same time.
