Danny Churchill, a young philandering playboy, is taken out of college by his concerned father and sent to Cody College, somewhere in the American West, in the hope that hell stay away from girls and knuckle down to his studies. En route from the train depot he meets Ginger, the local postal mistress and toast of all the students and falls for her. Initially not pleased with what he finds at the school, not least the primitive facilities and practical-joking fellow-students, he eventually settles in. Danny and Ginger are devastated when they learn that the college must close, due to falling enrollments. Using his fathers society and business contacts, he approaches the state governor and extracts a promise that the college may be reprieved if enrollments improve. Danny decides to put on a show to bring back the old west and persuades the college Dean to buy the first ticket. Tommy Dorseys band is engaged, the event is a success, student enrollments roll in, and the future of the college is assured.
