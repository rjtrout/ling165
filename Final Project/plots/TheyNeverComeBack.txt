Distracted just before the fight by the news that his mother has died, boxer Jimmy Nolan is defeated in the ring. As he and his sister Mary attend the funeral, Jimmy also deals with an injured arm from the fight. At a nightclub Jerry Filmore owns, Jimmy meets dancer Adele, who is Filmores romantic interest as well. A ticket taker at the door, Ralph Landon, takes $500 from the till and plants it on Jimmy, framing him. Jimmy goes to jail. Ralph falls in love with Mary and confides to her that he owed $1,000 to Filmore and set up her brother on his behalf. Jimmy gets out of jail, accepts a fight and wins a $1,000 prize, settling Ralphs account with Filmore. It leads to a fistfight between the two men. Jimmy wins that one as well.
