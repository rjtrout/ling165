DeMarigny wants to sleep with Drum, but his advances are rejected by the slave and DeMarigny vows revenge against Drum. Drum and his friend Blaise (Kotto) are eventually sold to plantation owner Hammond Maxwell (Oates) and are both taken to his plantation to work. Regine (Grier) is purchased by Maxwell as well and is taken to the plantation for his own personal desires as a bedwench. After arriving at Maxwells plantation, Regine is set up in the bedroom above Hammond. Augusta Chauvel (Lewis), Maxwells fianc√© is jealous and has other plans for Regine.
