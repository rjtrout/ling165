As described in a film magazine, Joan (Murray), a waif that was adopted by the keeper of a boarding house, runs away and becomes a cashier at a restaurant, but quits when the manager attempts to make love to her. She meets Louie (Ferguson), with whom she was once friendly, and he forces her to steal for him. She is caught and sentenced to a state reformatory. En route she escapes from the train by jumping into a stream and swims ashore, where she is picked up by Bertram (Oakman), the son of wealthy parents. He takes her home and she is permitted to stay there. Louie tries several times to get Joan under his power, but fails. Bertram marries Joan despite her past.
