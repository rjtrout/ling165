Ray Sharkey plays Vincent Vacari, a songwriter and entertainment manager, driven by his desire to discover the next big act. After watching a local band play, Vacari approaches the talented saxophone player, Tomaso DeLorusso (Paul Land), convincing him to trade his instrument for a microphone. After some months under the guidance of Vacari, the newly named "Tommy Dee" becomes a rock n roll sensation. Moving forward from his success with Tommy Dee, Vacari prepares another act in the form of Guido (Peter Gallagher), a local teen who had been working as a busboy. With even more gusto and single-mindedness, Vacari embarks on a destructive journey to control every aspect of his new acts image. Despite his obvious flair for making idols, Vacaris girlfriend, Brenda (Tovah Feldshuh), is concerned that his obsession is destroying everyone around him, including himself.
