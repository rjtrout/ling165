It is the early 1900s. Distinguished philosopher Leopold and his much younger fianc√©e, Ariel, are going to spend a weekend in the country with Leopolds cousin Adrian, and her crackpot inventor husband Andrew. Also on the guest list is womanizing doctor, Maxwell, and his latest girlfriend, a free-thinking nurse, Dulcy. Over the course of the weekend, old romances reignite, new romances develop, and everyone ends up sneaking off behind everyone elses backs.
