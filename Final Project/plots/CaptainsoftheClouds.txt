Brian MacLean (James Cagney), Johnny Dutton (Dennis Morgan), "Tiny" Murphy (Alan Hale, Sr.), "Blimp" Lebec (George Tobias), and British expatriate "Scrounger" Harris (Reginald Gardiner) are bush pilots competing for business in rugged Northern Ontario, Canada in 1939, as the Second World War is beginning. Dutton, whose ambition is to start his own airline, flies by the book but MacLean is a seat-of-the-pants kind of pilot, mirroring the differences in their personalities. Dutton saves MacLeans life after he is struck in the head by a still-moving propeller by transporting a doctor under dangerous flying conditions. MacLean is grateful and joins Dutton in a temporary partnership to help Dutton earn the seed fund for his airline. When Dutton rejects MacLeans warning about the gold digging character of Duttons badly-behaved girlfriend Emily Foster (Brenda Marshall), MacLean marries her in order to save Dutton from a life of misery. Dutton, however, does not understand that MacLeans actions are an act of kindness, and so he abruptly ends their friendship. Depressed, Dutton impulsively gives his savings to charity and enlists in the Royal Canadian Air Force.  Later, after hearing Winston Churchills "We shall fight on the beaches" speech on the radio, MacLean and the other bush pilots attempt to enlist in the air force, only to discover that they are too old for combat. They reluctantly agree to train as flight instructors for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Their superior officer is none other than Dutton. MacLeans brash and fiercely independent nature clashes with the military way of doing things, and he inevitably washes out. For revenge, he and "Tiny" buzz the airfield in their bush planes when renowned Canadian First World War ace Air Marshal William "Billy" Bishop (playing himself) is speaking during the groups graduation ceremony. During the buzzing,"Tiny" suffers a blackout (loss of vision due to g-forces), crashes the plane and dies. When two transport aircraft crash, killing all 44 ferry pilots aboard, there is a desperate call for pilots to ferry a group of unarmed Lockheed Hudson bombers from Gander, Newfoundland to Britain. MacLean pretends to be Murphy and volunteers. Dutton recognizes him but nonetheless permits him to fly after the two reconcile. Near the coast of the British Isles, the bombers are attacked ruthlessly by a single German fighter plane, a Messerschmitt Bf 109. "Blimp" Lebecs plane is shot down and it becomes clear that the Messerschmitt intends to pick off the bombers one by one. After MacLeans navigator "Scrounger" is killed, MacLean uses his flying skills to crash his unwieldy bomber into the nimble fighter, sacrificing himself to save the remainder of the group.
