The story takes place in a small town in Georgia. Edith (Dove) is a girl who has loved Jim Carter (Withers) since childhood. One day they get into a quarrel and an older and very wealthy man, Norton Larrison (Thomson), seizes the opportunity to court Edith. Larrison succeeds in making Edith forget Jim temporarily. Edith marries Larrison and then go to Europe on their honeymoon. Soon after they return to Georgia, Edith discovers that she is still in love with Jim. She is determined, however, to be a faithful wife and vows to hide her love for Jim. One day Larrison overhears a conversation to the effect that Jim can never forget his love for Edith. Harrison becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife. It finally reaches the point where he manages to kill all the respect and love that Edith held for him as her husband. The picture comes to a climax as both Norton and Jim each vows to kill the other.
