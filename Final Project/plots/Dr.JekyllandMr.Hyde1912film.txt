White-haired Dr. Jekyll has secretly locked himself in his laboratory administering himself with a vial of formula. He slumps into his chair with his head on his chest. Slowly, as the drug takes effect, a dark-haired, taloned beast now appears in the chair. After repeated use, Jekylls evil alter ego emerges at will, causing Jekyll to murder his sweethearts father. The evil personality scuttles back to the laboratory only to discover that the antidote is finished and that he will be as Mr. Hyde forever. A burly policeman breaks down Jekylls door to find that the kindly doctor is dead after taking poison.
