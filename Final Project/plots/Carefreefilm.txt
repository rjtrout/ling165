Psychiatrist Dr. Tony Flagg (Fred Astaire) does his friend Stephen Arden (Ralph Bellamy) a favor by taking on his fiancee, Amanda Cooper (Ginger Rogers), as a patient. Amanda, a singer on the radio, cant seem to make a decision about Stephens many proposals of marriage, so Tony probes with her subconscious mind. He is to interpret her dreams. When Amanda dreams of dancing with her doctor, shes convinced that shes in love and to avoid telling Tony about the dream, makes up a wild dream. This leads Tony to believe that Amanda has serious physchiatric problems and he hypnotizes her to act on her impulses. By some chance, Stephen comes by, not knowing that shes under the spell and Amanda is crazy in public. The next day, there is a party and Amanda gets Tony to dance with her (the Yam) and in the process of trying to tell Stephen that shes in love with her doctor, Stephen thinks that shes saying that shes in love with him. Amanda then dances with Tony, telling him that "something terrible has happened, and youre mixed up in it." So, good old Tony hypnotizes Amanda again, saying that Tony does not love her and that "Men like him should be shot down like dogs." Alas, Amanda gets out again and finds a gun at the country club and starts shooting at Tony. Suddenly, Tony realizes that hes in love with Amanda and desperately tries to undo his doing. Stephen accuses him of trying to take his wife away. At Amanda and Stephens wedding day, he sneaks in and wants to punch Amanda so that she is unconscious and he can hypnotize her but cant bring himself to do it. Stephen barges in, aims a punch at Tony but smacks Amanda unconscious instead. Tony then tells Amanda that he loves her, and theyre married.
