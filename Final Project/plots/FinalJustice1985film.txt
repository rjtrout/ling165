Mafiosi Joseph Palermo (Venantino Venantini) and his brother Tony are fleeing across the border after assassinating a building contractor. They get into a car accident and, after killing the driver of the other car, they decide to hijack a car from a local police station. In the ensuing firefight, Palermo shoots and kills the sheriff (Greydon Clark). The gangsters are pursued across the border by the sheriffs deputy, a no-nonsense Apache named Thomas Jefferson Jeronimo (Baker). He shoots Tony dead and captures Joseph, who swears he will take revenge for his brothers death. As a publicity stunt, a US State Department official named Wilson (Bill McKinney) orders Jeronimo to escort Palermo to Italy. However, the plane is sabotaged and forced to land in Malta. Soon after arriving in Valletta, Jeronimo is ambushed by gangsters and Palermo escapes his custody. The Maltese police, under the command of Superintendent Mifsud (Lino Grech), assure Jeronimo that they will recapture Palermo themselves. Chief Wilson telephones and orders Jeronimo to return to Texas. But Jeronimo is determined to capture Palermo himself. With the help of a local policewoman, Maria Cassar (Helena Dalli), he tracks Palermo to the estate of Don Lamanna, a local bigwig. Jeronimo is repeatedly arrested by the Maltese authorities, but always manages to escape and continue his pursuit of the gansgter. Eventually, it turns out that Palermo was in cahoots with Wilson, who had never intended for Jeronimo to deliver Palermo to Italy. In the end, Cassar kills Wilson and Jeronimo kills Palermo.
