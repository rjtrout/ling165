Mr. Tucker (Platt), proprietor of a Los Angeles coffee house, hires three down-on-their-luck patrons: out-of-work actor John Mapes (Palmer); struggling writer Ray Miller (Lupton); and George Leland (Sullivan), the wayward son of movie star Rita Leland, to participate in an armored car robbery to take place during a four-hour stopover in Chicago during the trios train trip from Los Angeles to New York. Mapes worried wife Jeanne joins him on the train, concerned about his not having had a job in more than a year. Tucker and his henchman Sidney (Glass) fly ahead to set up the robbery, which goes off without a hitch. However, once back on the train, Lelands greed gets the better of him. Tucker double crosses the trio, eliminating Leland and Miller, leaving Mapes as the only one left to stop Tucker from getting away with murder, along with the entire haul. Jean manages to keep police from shooting her husband as he foils the scheme. Movie star Rita is surrounded by reporters as she waits for son George to arrive on the train, unaware that he is dead.
