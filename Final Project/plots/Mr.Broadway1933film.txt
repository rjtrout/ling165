The plot involves a newspaper reporter (Ed Sullivan, aka "Mr. Broadway") gathering material for his column. The plot was patterned on a similar film by columnist Walter Winchell, Broadway Through a Keyhole (1933). The Sullivan film primarily serves as a vehicle for him to escort viewers to various trendy New York nightclubs to watch celebrities.
