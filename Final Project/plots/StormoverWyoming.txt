A range war develops between cattlemen and sheepmen. A couple of cowhands, Dave Saunders and Chito Rafferty, get caught in the middle when they rescue Tug Campbell, whos about to be lynched by sheep ranch foreman Jess Rawlins and his men without a fair trial. In town, Rawlins seeks revenge, but saloon singer Ruby slips a gun to Dave, who shoots Rawlins pistol from his hand. Ranch owner Chris Marvin returns to town and she believes her foreman Rawlinss lies, including his attempt to frame Dave and Chito after they catch one of Rawlins men red-handed, rustling sheep. Rawlins shoots the rustler with a rifle, then takes Dave and Chito prisoner and intends to hang them. Ruby intervenes again, sneaking a gun to Chito inside a guitar. The cowhands prove to Chris that the rustler was killed with a rifle, which neither of them carries. A gunfight leads to Dawkins being dealt with, Dave and Chris forming a bond. But when Ruby begins feeling romantic, Chito has other ideas and rides off.
