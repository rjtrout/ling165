Frankie (Harris Dickinson) struggles to escape his Brooklyn home life. He balances his time with a new girlfriend (Madeline Weinstein), his friends, and chatting with older men on the Internet, whom he meets up with for sex and drugs. He does not, however, identify as bisexual or gay to his girlfriend or male friends. He just "has sex with men," in the words of one of his Internet partners. Frankie attempts to compartmentalize his life by having sex with older men, to avoid them happening to know his friends. This becomes increasingly difficult, however, as he moves about the area and he happens to run into them, or lures them to meetings for drugs.
