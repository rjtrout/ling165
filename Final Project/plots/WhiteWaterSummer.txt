School is out for the summer, and a group of young teenagers go on a hike with Vic, an experienced guide. One teen, Alan, butts heads with Vic during the film, as the life lessons Vic attempts to teach annoy him. The more defiant Alan gets, the more extreme the lessons come from Vic. Alans defiance and Vics aggressive lessons culminate in disaster and Vic winds up breaking his leg. Alan then has to use his skills and some of Vics to get down from the mountain.
