As Elmer has Bugs Bunny cornered on his hunting trip, Elmer receives a telegram from his Uncle Louie who leaves him $3 million in his will, as long as he doesnt harm any animals, especially rabbits. Elmer changes his tune to one of uncharacteristic niceness and sets Bugs free. Bugs, with characteristic Ã©lan, takes full advantage of the situation by sneaking into Elmers house before Elmer returned and making himself at home. As Elmer returns, he hears Bugs singing "Angel in Disguise", while taking a shower and later shaving; Bugs uses the opportunity to purposely aggravate Elmer, knowing that he has Uncle Louie as blackmail and because of this Elmer cannot effectively punish Bugs in any way at the risk of losing his inheritance. Elmer tries to coax Bugs into leaving, gently patting him on the head, which Bugs claims that he is hurting him and threatens to call Uncle Louie. Elmer apologizes to Bugs then tricks him into walking out of the house. Bugs resorts to faking a serious illness, prompting Elmer to take him back in, afraid he may have lost the inheritance for good. Later a special delivery letter arrives for Elmer, which informs him that Uncle Louie has "kicked the bucket" and that he now inherits the $3 million. However, the amount of the various estate taxes, including a $2 million inheritance tax, claims the entirety of the inheritance and leaves Elmer owing Louies lawyer $1.98. Furious at Bugs torment and intrusion for all that, Elmer, at his wits end, is finally free to vent his anger on Bugs and chases him around the house until Bugs escapes out the front door, to which Elmer slams shut. Elmer, briefly relieved that he is finally rid of Bugs, then receives a large Easter egg delivery from a postman. Upon opening it, an impossibly large litter of baby Bugs Bunnies who say "Eh, whats up Doc?" in unison begin to leap around the house.
