Based on the successful 1956 Broadway production of the same name by Betty Comden, Adolph Green, and Jule Styne, the film focuses on Ella Peterson, who works in the basement office of Susanswerphone, a telephone answering service. Peterson, based on Mary Printz, who worked at Greens service, listens in on others lives and adds some interest to her own humdrum existence by adopting different identities for her clients. They include an out-of-work Method actor, a dentist with musical yearnings, and in particular playwright Jeffrey Moss, who is suffering from writers block and desperately needs a muse. Adding complications to the plot are the police, who are certain the business is a front for an "escort service," and the owners shady boyfriend, who unbeknownst to her is using the agency as a bookmaking operation.
