Nick Cavanaugh is a lonely Atlanta surgeon obsessed with a woman named Helena. After she suffers a high grade tibial fracture in a hit-and-run motor vehicle accident in front of his home, he kidnaps and treats her in his house surreptitiously, amputating both of her legs above the knee. Later, he amputates her healthy arms above the elbow after she tries to choke him. Though Helena is the victim of Nicks kidnapping and mutilation, she dominates the dialogue with her constant ridiculing of him for all of his shortcomings.
