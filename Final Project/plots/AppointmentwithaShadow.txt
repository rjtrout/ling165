An alcoholic, Paul Baxter has ruined his career as a reporter. After passing out in Pat OConnells bar, he is taken home by his friend, police lieutenant Spencer, to his sister Penny, who is romantically involved with Spence. Penny has a tip on a story that could change her brothers life, but will reveal it only on the condition that Paul can go 24 hours without drinking. Hungover and shaking, Paul tries. He needs to be sober and alert at 7 p.m. when a fugitive criminal, Dutch Hayden, is supposed to show up at a restaurant. Spence has information that Hayden has undergone plastic surgery to alter his appearance and is about to leave the country. Paul makes it on time, but in rocky shape. An accident causes his clothing to be soaked in liquor. Hayden arrives with his stripper girlfriend, Flo Knapp, but just as Spencers men shoot him dead, Paul spots the real Hayden, whose face has not been changed at all. Its a set-up. Every attempt made by Paul to persuade Spencer and Penny of the mistake goes for naught because they are certain that he was drunk. When he sets about proving Hayden is alive, Flo takes him captive at gunpoint. Only in the end does Spence realize that Paul was right all along.
