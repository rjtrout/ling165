Donald OConnor plays Wilbur McMurtry, a traveling salesman who is captured and held hostage by the local authorities in a small town, who wish to compel him to run in the annual foot-race against a rival town. A highlight of the film is his brilliant dance routine, in a barn, to the Al Jolson song, "Me and My Shadow".
