Wives and girlfriends sit together at a Sox game to watch Wacky Waters pitch. Hes a fun-loving guy who is delighted to learn that Hollywood star Pepita Zorita is at todays game, selling kisses for charity. Wacky promptly borrows money from team publicity man Updyke to buy $300 worth. In the grandstand, catcher Hippo Joness wife Hazel and the other women are concerned. Wacky is the best pitcher in baseball when he concentrates on what hes doing, but whenever a pretty girl turns his head, a distracted Wacky suddenly cant throw the ball over the plate. The wives want the Sox to be in the World Series so their husbands will receive bonus money. Sure enough, Wackys infatuation with Pepita begins a run of bad luck for him and the Sox at the ballpark. On the train, the wives protest until Wacky discloses that he and Pepita secretly ran off to get married. While they are happy for the couple, Hazel schemes to have a Hollywood producer require Pepitas presence to shoot a movie there. This could keep Wacky focused on baseball until the World Series. Pepita finishes the film faster than expected. She hurries to Kansas City to see Wacky and the Sox, so the wives take matters into their own hands, tying up Pepita in a hotel room against her will. Wacky eventually wins the World Series for the Sox, but this time, its only because the woman he loves is there.
