A professor at a college in California, Dr. Peter Proud (Michael Sarrazin), begins to have recurring dreams. In one nightmare, Proud appears to see a man murdered by a woman in a rowboat while he is swimming naked. The murdered man repeatedly cries, "Marcia, dont!" Proud is haunted by his dreams and seeks medical treatment. He attends a "sleep lab" to try to decipher his dreams. However, the dreams do not register as being dreams; in fact, they do not register at all. One evening while watching television, several of his "visions" play out before him on a local documentary entitled "The Changing Face of America". He sees the arch and the church that have been dominating his dreams, and calls the television station to discover the location. Upon learning that the location of his "visions" is in Massachusetts, Proud and his girlfriend Nora (Cornelia Sharpe) travel there. In Massachusetts, the couple drive from town to town, but are unsuccessful until they arrive in Springfield. It is here that Proud begins to see familiar sights from his dreams, such as the bridge, the church, the Puritan statue, and others. Eventually, Peter locates Marcia (Margot Kidder), the mystery woman from his nightmares, and befriends her daughter Ann (Jennifer ONeill) at a local country club. Marcia is suspicious of Peter, and curious about his motives, and how he knows so much about her life. Ann and Peter eventually fall in love, to Marcias disapproval, when she is made aware that Peter Proud is a reincarnation of her deceased husband. Peter had discovered earlier that by re-enacting his dreams, he would stop having that particular dream/vision. The Lake Dream was his last nightmare to be conquered. The film ends as Peter Proud is drawn to the lake where the original crime was committed years ago, and suffers the same fate he did in his previous life.
