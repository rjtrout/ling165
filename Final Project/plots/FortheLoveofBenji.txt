Mary (Patsy Garrett) and the Chapman kids, Paul and Cindy (Allen Fiuzat and Cynthia Smith, respectively), take a vacation to Athens, Greece, with Benji and Tiffany in tow. (Dr. Chapman remains back home on business, planning to join the family later, hence the reason for him not appearing in the film.) Benji becomes lost in Athens, trying to reunite with Mary and the kids while secret agents pursue him, seeking a formula which was glued to his paw in order to get it past customs. Benji hides in the archaeological site of the ancient Athenian marketplace, where he is befriended by another stray, and in the narrow streets of an old Greek neighborhood, where he is pursued by Chandler, a criminal who—with the help of a vicious Doberman Pinscher—abducts Benji in order to seize the formula. Benji eventually manages to escape Chandlers clutches and flees back to the Chapmans hotel. Benji is then shocked to see Chandler parked in front of the hotel, holding Cindy hostage in his car at gunpoint. Benji then dashes forward toward the car and lunges at Chandlers hand that is holding the gun and bites it, causing Chandler to let go of the gun. Cindy is then rescued and Chandler is arrested by police at gunpoint.
