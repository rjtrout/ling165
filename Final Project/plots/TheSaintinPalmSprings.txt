Simon Templar is asked by his friend, Inspector Farnack, to protect Peter Johnson, a man trying to transport a cache of rare stamps from New York City to his niece Elna, a tennis pro for a hotel in Palm Springs, California. In an attempted robbery, Simon strikes an unseen assailant in the face with his "Saint" ring. On the train west, Simon is introduced to Margaret Forbes, who will be a guest at the Palm Springs hotel. There the stamps are stolen from a safe, so Simon employs his pal, pickpocket "Pearly" Gates, to steal belongings from every other hotel guest. The stamps are found in a pillbox, but Pearly forgets who owned it. Simon sets a trap at Joshua Tree National Park, where he is first accosted at gunpoint by Margaret, who turns out to be a foreign agent. Another guest, however, turns out to be the mastermind of the plot to steal the stamps, and the mark from Simons ring on his face is additional proof of his guilt.
