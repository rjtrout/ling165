In the 1920s, just after World War I, in an Irish village named Kilshannon, Edwina Broome has moved into the neighborhood known as "Widows Peak," named for the prevalent marital status of the residents, who are a rather exclusive group. The residents are curious about their new neighbor, Edwina, but information is not available about her, even for the leader of the place, Mrs. Doyle Counihan, whose son is busy attempting to attract Edwina. Miss OHare and Edwina immediately dislike each other, however, and soon some accidental encounters begin to look like Edwina is trying to ruin her new rival. The problems escalate and the town is in an uproar, but they get no closer to solving the mystery of the newcomer.
