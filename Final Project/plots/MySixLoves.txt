Janice Courtney is a big success on Broadway, but the busy actress collapses from exhaustion. A doctor orders her to return to her Connecticut home for a long rest. In a shack on her property, Janice discovers six children and a large dog, abandoned and living on their own. Taking them in, Janice takes care of the kids with the help of housekeeper Ethel and a local minister, Jim Larkin. Being a mother appeals to her, but when producer Marty Bliss persuades her to resume her career, Janice returns to New York to begin a new play. Everything changes when one of the children goes missing. A frantic Janice leaves the play, and when the child is finally found, realizes that this is the life she wants, which she intends to share with Jim.
