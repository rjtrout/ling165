The movie opens with sixteen year old "Ramona" with his mother Maggie, grandmother, and grandmothers partner at the doctor getting final instructions on gender transition. Ray lives with his unmarried mother, who lives with her domineering lesbian mother, Dolly and her partner, Frances. The four live together and they all have trouble with the new gender terms. Dolly thinks it would be easier if Ray would just be a lesbian, while Maggie understands that Ray is a transgender man. Ray is ready to start testosterone shots and change schools, but he needs written consent from both parents. Rays father is an absent parent and Maggie is afraid to make such a permanent decision. Maggie locates the 10-year absent father but he wants some time to think. Blaming father Craigs indecision gives Maggie time to stall. On his own, Ray locates his father to find him remarried with 3 children. He also learns that Maggie slept with Craigs brother and "uncle" Matthew might be his real father. Maggie is the reason he never had a father. Ray feels lied to, alone, and as though he will be trapped in a female body forever. Grandma Dolly decides its time for the four to have a man in the house. She now supports Rays transition to a man. Matthew and Maggie talk. Craig signs the consent form after the Maggie signs. Ray finds happiness. The movie ends with everyone out to dinner at a Japanese restaurant.
