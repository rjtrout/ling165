Betrayed is an espionage thriller set in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II, and revolves mostly around the Dutch resistance movement. Dutch intelligence agent Pieter Deventer (Clark Gable) is ordered to keep an eye on suspected collaborator Fran Seelers (Lana Turner). Both Deventer and Seelers join the Dutch underground, making contact with a flamboyant resistance leader known as "The Scarf" (Victor Mature). As Carla Van Oven, Seelers assignment is to use her feminine charms to gain the confidence of admiring Nazi officers. Within the next few weeks, several underground operatives are captured and shot, and it begins to look as though Deventers suspicions concerning Seelers are correct, though he is strongly drawn to her. The ultimate revelation of the collaborators identity settles the issue of whether the couple can be enemies or lovers.
