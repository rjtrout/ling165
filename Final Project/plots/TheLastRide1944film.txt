With rubber increasingly scarce during wartime, a criminal ring sells ones of inferior quality to a man whose car then crashes, resulting in his death. Police detective Pat Harrigan is assigned to investigate. Pat is living in a house owned by Kitty Kelly and her mother. His brother Mike has been seeing Kitty, but both are concerned about Mikes criminal activities. Pat goes undercover, pretending to have been suspended by the force, unaware that his own captain, Butler, is a mastermind of the criminal ring. After a car bomb is planted by thug Joe Genna, following Butlers orders, Mikes conscience gets the better of him. Butler is about to lure Pat to his death when Mike saves him, sacrificing his own life in the process.
