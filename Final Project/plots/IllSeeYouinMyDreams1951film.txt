Gus Kahn (Danny Thomas) is the prolific tunesmith, whose fortunes take an upswing in 1908 when he meets and falls in love with Grace LeBoy (Doris Day). Kahns career ascends to spectacular heights via such hits as "Pretty Baby", "My Buddy", "Toot, Toot, Tootsie", and "Makin Whoopee", only to go into eclipse when he loses his savings in the 1929 stock-market crash.
