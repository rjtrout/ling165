Before the play begins, two 11-year-old children, Ferdinand Reille and Bruno Vallon (Benjamin and Henry in the Broadway production), get involved in an argument because Bruno refuses to let Ferdinand join his gang. Ferdinand knocks out two of Brunos teeth with a stick. That night, the parents of both children meet to discuss the matter. Ferdinands father, Alain (Alan in the Broadway production), is a lawyer who is never off his mobile phone. Ferdinands mother, Annette is in "wealth management" (her husbands wealth, to be precise), and consistently wears good shoes. Brunos father, Michel (Michael in the Broadway production), is a self-made wholesaler with an unwell mother. Michels wife, VÃ©ronique (Veronica in the Broadway production), is writing a book about Darfur. As the evening goes on, the meeting degenerates into the four getting into irrational arguments, and their discussion falls into the loaded topics of misogyny, racial prejudice and homophobia. One of the central dramatic moments of the play occurs when Annette vomits onstage, all over the coffee table and books.
