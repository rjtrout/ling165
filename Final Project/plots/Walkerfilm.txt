In 1853, soldier-of-fortune William Walker flees Mexico after a failed attempt to incite an armed insurrection. He is placed on trial by US officials, but wins acquittal on breaking the Neutrality Act. Walker believes in Manifest Destiny and has plans to marry and start a newspaper until his fianceé Ellen Martin dies of cholera. Financed by American multimillionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt, Walker and 60 mercenaries embark on a mission to overthrow the government of Nicaragua, to secure Vanderbilts rights over an overland shipping route between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Walker and his corps score a bloody victory in Nicaragua and when the capital falls, Walker allows the President to stay in charge, but takes his mistress, Doña Yrena. With increasing disruption in the country, Walker orders the President shot and assumes the presidency for himself. From 1855 to 1857, his actions as president become increasingly manic and delusional, with Walker antagonizing his financial backer by revoking Vanderbilts license to the overland trade route. Nicaragua and its neighbors unite to rid themselves of the unwelcome dictator, and they drive the despot out. Eventually, without the support of Vanderbilt or the US government, Walkers further forays into Central America lead to his capture and execution.
