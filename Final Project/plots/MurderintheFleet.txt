Captain John Winslow (Arthur Byron) is notified by the Secretary of the Navy that his cruiser will be receiving a new firing control gear manufactured by World Electric company, which is supposed to revolutionize naval warfare. The gear vanishes and is quickly located by intelligence officers where it is being transported across the Mexican border. When the gear is returned to the ship the secrecy surrounding the events catches the notice of reporter Walter Drake (J. Anthony Hughes). Lieutenant Tom Randolph (Robert Taylor) and Captain Winslow welcome visitors Al Duval (Raymond Hatton), who works for World Electric Company, and Victor Hanson (Jean Hersholt) from the Navy Department, aboard while the gear is installed. Meanwhile, Sailor Spud Burke (Nat Pendleton) gets caught between his sweetheart Toots Timmons (Una Merkel) and an old flame Betty Lansing (Jean Parker). When the new gear is being lifted into place a cable breaks and it is dropped, later this is found to be an act of sabotage. To add to the confusion, Al Duval is murdered during a gun salute. The investigation begins and suspicions are running high when a second murder takes place, this time it is the chief electrician. The Captain devises a plot to trap the murderer and the trail soon leads to the powder magazine, where Victor Hanson threatens to blow up the ship. Hanson claims that World Electric Company had stolen the idea and he wants revenge. Ultimately Hanson is captured and the gear is installed.
