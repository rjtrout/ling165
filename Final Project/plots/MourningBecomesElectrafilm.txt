A wealthy New England family, the Mannons, await the return of patriarch Ezra, general for the Union army, and son Orin, a timid young man before becoming an Army officer at the end of the Civil War. Lavinia, who adores her father, is shocked to see mother Christine kissing another man. Worse yet, the man is sea captain Adam Brant, someone whom Lavinia has long fancied herself, even though her childhood friend Peter Niles has been courting her. Learning from family servant Seth that, complicating matters further, Adam is actually a relative, a son of Lavinias uncle, causes her to confront her mother. To her astonishment, Lavinia finds out that Christine is completely aware of the family relationship, but has hated Ezra since the day she married him. Adam has hidden motives as well. He hates the Mannons for the way they treated his mother, who is now deceased. He is seeking revenge by toying with Christines affections. But when she comes to him with a plot to kill Ezra by poisoning him, Adam is reluctant to go that far with his scheme. Ezra returns home. His harrowing experiences during the war have persuaded him to try for a closer relationship with his wife. Christine is thrown by this, but elects to proceed with her plan to kill him. Ezra does indeed die, but Lavinia comes into possession of the pills that her mother used to poison him. One tragedy follows another. Orin decides to shoot Adam for what hes done. Christine commits suicide. Lavinia decides to marry Peter after all, but his sister Hazel discloses that her family has all but disowned Peter for having anything to do with the Mannons. Orin is riddled with guilt and kills himself as well. All is lost for Lavinia, who has Seth nail shut the shutters of the windows to their home, locking herself away from the world forever.
