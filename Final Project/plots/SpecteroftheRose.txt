A male ballet superstar is suspected of murdering his first wife (his former ballet partner) and now possibly threatening his new wife and ballet partner. Andre Sanine has not performed since his wifes death on stage. He has been haunted by Le Spectre de la Rose, the music being played when she collapsed. But he is willing to attempt a comeback arranged by impresario Max "Poli" Polikoff, who tries to persuade ballet instructor Madame La Sylph that the time has come for Sanine, her former student, to return. Sanine is to perform with Haidi, the companys new prodigy. As they rehearse, they also fall in love. La Sylph cautions her that she saw Sanines rage in person before Ninas death. Haidi attempts to keep Sanine by her side for several days, concerned over signs of a relapse in his behavior. Hearing the music, Sanine picks up a knife and places it at the throat of the sleeping Haidi, the woman he loves. He comes to his senses at the last possible second, then sacrifices himself for her sake.
