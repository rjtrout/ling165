Anna (Betsy Drake) visits an orphanage and decides to foster a child. Jane, a very unhappy 13-year-old, moves in with her, her engineer husband, "Poppy" Rose (Cary Grant), and her three children. Later, 12-year-old orphan Jimmy-John, who walks with an orthopedic disability, also moves in with them. Setbacks occur as the children struggle with acceptance by their new siblings. A boys snobby mother forbids him to take Jane to a formal school dance, but she attends anyhow, wearing a new gown, and is very popular there. Jimmy-John smashes his new bicycle in frustration, feeling that his new siblings are not accepting him. It is discovered that he can barely read, and must be tutored by Anna. He is caught at voyeurism. Poppy seriously considers returning the two adoptees to the orphanage. However, all these setbacks are overcome and the two new children become full members of the family. Jimmy-John makes a difficult hike alone in the snow to fulfill a Scouting requirement. At a school PTA meeting, Anna makes a speech to parents on the rewards of adopting older children. The story ends with Jimmy-John receiving his highly-coveted Eagle Scout medal at a Court of Honor ceremony.
