A dancer known to everyone by the name Nylon has been working in Morocco at a somewhat disreputable nightclub owned by Paul Morales, who gets into some trouble with police. Nylon decides to set sail for Gibraltar on the North Empress, which docks along the way in Tangier. Tens of thousands of dollars are reported missing from the ships safe. Capt. Sam Graves also is notified that the ships purser has been found murdered. Insurance investigator Ray Shapley tries to piece together what happened, and after he questions Nylon, a romantic attraction between them develops. Morales turns up aboard ship. He reveals to Nylon that he was responsible for the theft and murder, along with his accomplice, Graves, the ships captain. Graves is persuaded that Nylon knows too much and must be done away with, but Shapley rescues her just in time.
