Bertie "Duke" Gray (Conrad Nagel) is a counterfeiter who has been sentenced to prison for ten years. Seeing that there is no chance to escape, he accepts his fate and settles down into prison life to make the best of it. Gray is friends with Bud Leonard (played by Raymond Hackett), a young man who can not stand prison for he is in love with Mary Dane (played by Bernice Claire) and misses her terribly. To make matters worse, while Hackett is in prison, the man who framed him, played by Lou Rinaldo (played by Maurice Black), is making a play for Mary. When she tempts Bud to escape he is ready to run the risk although it may mean his death. The two plan to meet each other when Hackett discloses to her that he is being sent to work on the road gang. Mary manages to get work at a farmhouse where the convicts usually eat, hoping to thereby see Bud. Rinaldo traces her to the house and schemes to get Hackett out of the way so he can have her instead. Rinaldo convinces Hackett and yet another prisoner ("King Callahan", played by Ralph Ince) whom Rinaldo had framed that now is the time to escape in the hope that he can have them caught in the attempt. Mary prevents Hacketts escape but Callahan falls for the trick. Callahan later shoots Rinaldo and is himself killed. To save Bud, who is supposed to be released soon, Gray informs against Rinaldo, although the evidence he provides will lead to an extra prison term for him. Gray is happy to make the sacrifice, knowing that Mary will be with the man she truly loves.
