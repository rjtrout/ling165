Fuzzy decides to give up the cowboy life after a calf he unsuccessfully hogtied gets her revenge by dragging Fuzzy through the prairie by his own lasso. Fuzzy purchases a general store figuring by buying things low and selling things at a higher price hell be rich. Sadly Fuzzys dreams come to a long pause when he discovers all his customers purchase their goods by credit, paying them back when their harvests or cattle sales come through. Adding to Fuzzys woes are the fact that he shares his store with an angry postmistress. Meanwhile two villains see their chance to become rich by playing the cattlemen, led by female boss Dale Kirby, and the farmers represented by Dan Harper against each other. The ensuing range war would benefit the pair with their buying the farmers land when they are driven off and taking the proceeds of rustled cattle that the pair blame on the farmers. Billy Carson sees their game and takes them on as well as the hostile cattlemen and farmers.
