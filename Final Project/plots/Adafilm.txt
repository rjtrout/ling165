Bo Gillis (Dean Martin) is a guitar-playing, young man from a Southern state who becomes a candidate for governor. He is elected after his opponents wife is revealed to have a dark secret, a fact that Bos campaign mastermind, Sylvester Marin (Wilfrid Hyde-White), makes sure becomes known to all. Shortly before the election, Bo goes to a nightclub where he is introduced to Ada Dallas (Susan Hayward), a working girl. They share a similar upbringing, and Bo feels an immediate bond. They elope, much to the chagrin of the candidates speechwriter Steve (Martin Balsam) and the cynical Sylvester, who wants the marriage annulled. The Gillises resist and begin life as the states first couple. Soon the governor finds that he is little more than a stooge, blindly signing whatever document Sylvester puts before him. His childhood friend Ronnie (Frank Maxwell) is dismissed as lieutenant governor for speaking out. Sylvester requests help from Ada in controlling her husband, but the states ambitious first lady demands something quite outrageous in return: to be named the new lieutenant governor. Bo is furious. He wanted Ada to be his refuge from dirty politics, not a part of it. He continues to oppose Sylvesters methods, which leads to a bombs being placed in the governors car. In the hospital, Bo tells Ada that he believes her to be a conspirator in his attack and insults her, causing her to angrily leave him. Ada is sworn in as acting governor. Quickly, though, she goes to work against Sylvester, promoting her husbands ideas for honest government. On the day of a decisive vote at the state capitol, as Bo views from the gallery, Sylvester and his henchman Yancey (Ralph Meeker) try to sabotage Adas plans by revealing evidence of her past as a prostitute. Bo speaks up on his wifes behalf. Sylvester is ruined, and Bo and Ada walk away from the capitol side by side.
