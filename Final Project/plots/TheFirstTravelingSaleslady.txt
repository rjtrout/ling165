Corset company owner and independent-thinking suffragette Rose Gillray has her wagon struck by a horseless carriage in 1897 New York. This early automobile is driven by Charlie Masters, who tells her its the transportation means of the future. At work, Rose is helping singer Molly Wade into a boldly designed new corset when she gets the idea that using it for Mollys costume on stage would help to promote sales, but instead the show is shut down by the police. With her business failing, Rose owes money to Jim Carter, whose steel business manufactures the metal used for a corsets stays. Jim takes a shine to Rose and offers her a chance to sell his barbed wire, which is not selling well out west, where his salesmen get run out of town - or worse. Ending up in Kansas City, accompanied by Molly and followed by Charlie, a cattlemens association convention seems a good place to try to sell the barbed wire. But cattle rancher Joel Kingdon gives her the runaround, attracted to her personally but warning her against peddling wire. She tries his home state of Texas next, but once again, Joel interferes, putting the women out of business temporarily. Joel and Jim both end up in love with Rose and proposing marriage, but she rejects both. Charlie, though, comes along offering a ride to California, where hes got another new notion that he wants to explore: machines that fly.
