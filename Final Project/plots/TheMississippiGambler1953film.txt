Mark Fallon (Tyrone Power) meets professional gambler "Kansas John" Polly (John McIntire), who takes him under his wing. As they board a riverboat bound for New Orleans, Kansas John advises him to be wary of F. Montague Caldwell (Ralph Dumke), an unscrupulous riverboat gambler. Mark makes the acquaintance of two fellow passenger, attractive Angelique Dureau (Piper Laurie) and her brother, Laurent (John Baer). Laurent loses a great deal of money at cards. He gives Mark a valuable diamond necklace to redeem his gambling IOUs. When Mark learns that it is Angeliques, he offers it back to her, but she angrily declines. Caldwell hires some men to ambush and rob Mark, but a friend warns Kansas John, and he and Mark jump ashore to reach New Orleans alive. There he meets the father of Angelique and Laurent, the sophisticated Edmond Dureau (Paul Cavanagh), a noted fencer who is impressed by Marks own skill with the sword. He invites Mark to his home, despite Marks warning that his son and daughter would not welcome him. Dureau wishes his daughter would feel differently toward Mark, but Angelique instead weds a banker, George Elwood (Ron Randell). Mark builds a successful casino. He and Edmond also give a helpful hand to Ann Conant (Julie Adams), the sister of an unlucky gambler who committed suicide after losing the money entrusted to him by his firm. Laurent falls for Ann, but she is smitten with Mark, so Laurent forces Mark into a duel. As the challenged party, Mark has the choice of weapons; he selects pistols instead of swords. Laurent dishonorably fires prematurely and misses. Mark refuses to shoot back. Angeliques husband skips town with everyones money after a scandal is uncovered. Mark, who had refused to withdraw his money out of consideration for Angelique, despite widespread disquieting rumors, is left penniless, so he returns to his old life as a gambler. Angelique realizes her true feelings and asks to go along.
