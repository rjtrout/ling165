The Stooges are menders who drum up business at a construction site by poking holes on the bottom of the workers lunch boxes, then offering to repair the holes. When their ruse is discovered, they are chased onto the site and blend in with a crowd of men seeking employment. Curly states that they are "the best riveters that ever riveted," and the hiring workman (Edmund Cobb) sends them to work on the 97th floor, despite Curlys debilitating fear of heights. While riveting, Larry also heats sausage for Moe and Curly. The foreman discovers Larry, who proceeds to toss Curly an actual rivet, who claims, "Its a weenie, but its kind of tough." Curly later uses a hard hat with a screwhead to engage the rivets while Moe drills them. The Stooges do a lousy job riveting and part of the building collapses when head foreman Mr. Blake (Vernon Dent) leans against a beam. He and several men chase the stooges, who escape by parachuting off the building and landing in their wagon below, with the chute tarp now covering it, and drive off. Just as the scene fades out, the sound of an off screen collision is heard!
