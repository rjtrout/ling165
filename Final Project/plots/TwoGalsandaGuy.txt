A singing couple (Alda and Paige) co-host a weekly television show in New York City, but a strain jeopardizes their personal and professional relationships. Della Oliver wants to adopt a child. Deke does not. Seymour, their sponsor, is threatening to rip up their new five-year contract if they dont immediately sign it. When adoption agency officials turn up, Deke goes behind Dellas back and puts on an act, making them see him as an unfit parent. Della discovers what he did and moves out. Time is running short before their next program. Deke, to his astonishment, spots a dead ringer for his wife on the street. He tracks down the woman, Sylvia Latour, and persuades her to impersonate Della on the TV show. The scheme fools the audience from a resemblance standpoint, but Sylvia cannot remember her lines. Della takes pity on Deke and trades places, getting the program back on track. A grateful Deke not only agrees to discuss parenthood, but even how the child they have together might not need be an adopted one.
