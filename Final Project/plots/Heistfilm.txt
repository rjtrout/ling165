Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) runs a ring of professional thieves, which includes Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo), Don "Pinky" Pincus (Ricky Jay) and Joes wife Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon). During a robbery of a New York City jewelry store, Joes face is captured by a security camera after he takes off his mask in an attempt to distract the stores last remaining employee. As both the picture and a witness can identify him, Joe retires from crime and plans to disappear on his sail boat with his wife. This does not sit well with Joes fence, Mickey Bergman (Danny DeVito), who runs a garment business as a front. After accruing a number of expenses in setting up another robbery, Bergman decides to withhold the payment due to Joe and his crew. He insists they go through with the other job â€” robbing an airplane carrying a large shipment of gold. Bergman further insists that his nephew, Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell), be a part of the crew. Joe accepts, but a series of shifting loyalties changes the complexity of their task, including Jimmys interest in Joes wife and Bergman and Jimmys belief that Joes skills are declining. They attempt to rob the plane twice. In their first attempt, while setting up explosive devices along the border of the airport, they are stopped by a passing officer. While Joe and Bobby talk the officer into leaving, an agitated Jimmy draws his gun but is stopped by Pinky. He forces his team out of finishing the job after he finds out that Pinky didnt destroy the getaway car, covered in the teams fingerprints. Bergman doesnt accept the teams departure and forces them to finish the job. The plane robbery is a series of misdirects. Pinky poses as a guard while Joe, Bobby, and Jimmy pose as airport security personnel. They stop the jet, pretending to be responding to an emergency. They fill a van with what they take from the plane, then move the van to a rented garage on the airport grounds, where they re-brand it and call for a tow truck to have it hauled away. Jimmy betrays the others to steal the gold and Fran. He knocks out Joe and tells Fran he knew Joe changed the plan, including Fran seducing him. He and Fran take the van, but Jimmy finds out that the hidden compartments are filled with metal washers. Joe avoids arrest and returns to the plane in disguise. He and Bobby remove a shipment of goods they had booked on board the same Swiss flight, which they insist now must be driven to its destination due to the planes delay. Inside the shipment is the stolen gold, which Joe and Bobby melt into long rods. Bergman apprehends Pinky, who is walking his niece to the school bus. Pinky discloses the plan in order to save his niece, though he is killed after. Bergman and his crew arrive at Joes sail boat along with Jimmy and Fran, where they hold Joe at gunpoint. They assume that the boats golden railings are the gold. Fran leaves with Jimmy, pleading with Bergman to let Joe go. Just as Bergman discovers that the railings are not the gold, a hidden Bobby opens fire. Bergmans men are killed and Joe kills Bergman. Bobby gives Joe the address to send his share. Joe waits to meet Fran with a truck filled with black-painted rods. Fran has taken up with Jimmy for real and they take the truck from Joe at gunpoint. Joe gets into a second truck to leave. A black bar in the truck scrapes the garage door, revealing gold underneath. Joe lifts a tarp in the truck bed, revealing the gold rods. He covers the rods with the tarpaulin and drives away.
