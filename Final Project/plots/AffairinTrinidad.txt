The film is set in Trinidad and Tobago while it was still a British colony. Chris Emery (Rita Hayworth) works as a nightclub singer and dancer. One night after her performance she receives news from Inspector Smythe (Torin Thatcher) and Anderson (Howard Wendell), a member of the American consulate, that her husband Neil was found dead. She is comforted by Neils friend Max Fabian (Alexander Scourby). Initially, the police conclude that Neil committed suicide based on his gunshot wound and due to a pistol at the crime scene. On further investigation they discover that Neil was in fact murdered. Inspector Smythe and Anderson take Chris into confidence and inform her that Neils boat was seen outside Fabians property at the time of his murder. Chris learns that Fabian is in fact a crook who has built his fortune by trading information and aiding in treason and that Neil could have been murdered due to his involvement in Fabians latest project. Chris agrees to exploit Fabians love for her to gather information for the police. Meanwhile, Neils brother Steve Emery (Glenn Ford) arrives in Trinidad at the request of his brother who had written to him about a prospective job. He is shocked to learn that his brother committed suicide shortly after writing to him and sets out to investigate matters on his own. After the inquest Chris and Steve spend some time together. Though she starts falling in love with Steve, Chris is unable to reveal to him her motive behind getting friendly with Fabian. As Chris inches closer to discovering the truth about Fabian, Steve gathers proof of Fabians involvement in Neils death. This leads to a showdown in the climax.
