Maggie Wilson joins the staff of a California institution for wayward girls, run by the stern Mrs. Nichols. A new arrival, Betsy Abel, hates her mother and has a two-month-old baby of her own, refusing to identify the father. "Greeneyes," one of the girls, is due to be released in a few weeks. Her boyfriend Cliff is a former drug addict, determined to stay clean. The girls at the institution bond, particularly when Betsys mother visits, threatening to put the baby up for adoption unless Betsy names the father so he can pay for the babys support. The mother is unaware her own boyfriend impregnated her daughter. The girls kidnap the child and care for it in secret. Maggie finally finds the baby and lets them keep it through Christmas, but once Mrs. Nichols has it taken away, the girls start a full-scale riot. Greeneyes is given a six-month extension to her sentence, against Maggies recommendation. Greeneyes escapes, but when she and Ed are chased by police, they are killed.
