In the French colony of Cochin-China, young French magistrate Victor Gromaire (Antonio Moreno) and his wife Hélène (Billie Dove) are virtually prisoners because the colonys president (Noah Beery) is attracted to the wife. The president blocks Victors career on the bench until his wife agrees to his demands. Victor, angered by this treatment after four years of hard work, secretly goes to the governor of the colony to complain. Advised by Carouge (Holmes Herbert), a prominent attorney in the colony, as to why her husbands career has been stymied, Hélène tries to save her husband from disaster by pleading with the president, but inadvertently reveals her husbands plan. Afraid for his safety, she consents to do whatever the president wishes, as long as he does nothing to endanger her husband. Just as he is about to take advantage of her offer, he is murdered by a native musician (Kamiyama Sojin) who has been hiding in the room. Hélène is immediately suspected of the murder, and the musician comes out of hiding and accuses her of the crime. Victor is placed in charge of the investigation and discovers that the musician is lying, and that he is the murderer. Tired of the dangers of life in the French colony, the couple head back to Paris, where Victor hopes to start a new career.
