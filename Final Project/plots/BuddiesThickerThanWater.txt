On a snowy night in New York City, Jerry is comfortably asleep inside a penthouse. Tom, meanwhile, is freezing in the alley below, after being evicted by his owner. He writes a note asking for help, slips it into a bottle, and throws it up to the penthouse window. Jerry, awakened by the noise, goes out to the balcony and finds the note. Alarmed, he rushes outside and he rescues a frozen Tom. He then brings him inside, and after thawing him out, serves him a hot meal. Tom and Jerry lounge about the penthouse, listening to music and drinking everything in the owners liquor cabinet. However, Toms owner returns and startles the inebriated pair. Jerry dives into his hole as the woman grabs Tom and prepares to throw him out again. Tom grabs Jerry and shows him to his owner, causing her to panic. Tom assures the owner hell get rid of the mouse, and goes outside to throw Jerry off the balcony into the alley. Inside, Tom is stroked and pampered by his owner; outside, Jerry is angered by the cats betrayal and wants revenge. Upon entering the house, Jerry sneaks past Tom and goes over to the womans make-up table, where he applies face powder on his body to resemble a ghost; his plan being to make it seem that he has died and come back from the dead to haunt Tom. Putting on a record of spooky music, Jerry chases the terrified Tom outside, but some of the powder washes off as Jerry advances through the snow. Tom is furious and angrily unsheathes his claws, and he prepared to kill Jerry, but accidentally spreads the snow on the side of the building and falls back down to the alley below. Tom desperately sends Jerry another note, but Jerry responds by throwing a pair of ice skates and an ice hockey stick down to him, then happily returns to his hole and goes to sleep.
