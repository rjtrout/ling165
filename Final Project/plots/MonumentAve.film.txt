Bobby mentors his young cousin, Seamus (Jason Barry), into a life of drugs and crime soon after Seamus emigrates from Dublin, Ireland. Bright, conscientious, but notably naive, Seamus finds himself unable to get used to the spontaneous dangers and recklessness of his new life in America. After two particularly traumatic incidents, Seamus is afraid of further involving himself with Bobby and Bobbys circle of criminal friends. Seamus tells Bobby he wants to return Dublin, and the two argue after Seamus blames Bobby for dragging him into a dangerous and "damaging" lifestyle he never wanted. Seamus is killed soon afterward when crime boss, Jackie OHara (Colm Meaney), mistakenly believes Seamus told police about OHaras criminal operations and an earlier hit that had been ordered against Bobby and Seamus cousin Teddy (Billy Crudup) â€“ who had made a deal with police in order to reduce a sentence hed already been serving.
