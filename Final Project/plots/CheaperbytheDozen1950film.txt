The parents are the time and motion study and efficiency experts Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr. (Clifton Webb) and psychologist Lillian Moller Gilbreth (Myrna Loy). The film shows typical days in the lives of a family in the 1920s, but here with 12 children and an efficiency engineer as the parent. This includes scenes where Frank employs his unorthodox teaching methods on his children, and classic clashes between conservative parents and their childrens desire for more freedom (flashier clothing, make up, etc.). Frank takes every opportunity to study motion and increase efficiency, and even films his childrens tonsillectomies to see if there are ways to streamline the operation. After Franks sudden death, the family agrees that Lillian will continue with her husbands work; this enables the family to remain in their house (rather than move to their grandmothers in California), although, with a widowed working mother and one income, the children will have to assume much greater responsibilities.
