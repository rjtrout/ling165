Kay Barnett is a free spirit, much like her aunt Adelaide, but such flamboyant behavior is disapproved of by Kays father, Otis Barnett. He much prefers her to become a proper young lady and marry the dull but well-to-do Standish Prescott. Kay and her aunt go to a dance hall, where Danny OBrien mistakenly believes she is there for a dance contest. He pulls her into it and they take second prize. Danny also pays Kays bill when she takes a room at a hotel where he works as a busboy, rescuing her when she has no money. Danny and Kay decide to become a dance team but need a sponsor. They go to Aunt Adelaides sweetheart, Abner Kelly, who agrees, but Otis Barnett gets wind of it, pressures Abner and scuttles the deal, frustrating Danny. Ginger OBrien, his little sister, befriends Kay and the family enjoys becoming acquainted with her, only to take umbrage when they discover Otis is her father and shes not who she seemed to be. Danny finds a new partner, but after Otis has a change of heart, Kay is rushed to the stage to become Dannys partner, then become his wife.
