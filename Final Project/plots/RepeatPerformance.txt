On New Years Eve 1946, a woman is standing over her dead husband with a gun in her hand. She panics and goes to her friends for help. While seeking help from her friends at a pair of parties, she wishes that she could live 1946 all over again. Magically, because she wished exactly at the strike of midnight on New Years, her wish is granted and she is transported back to the beginning of 1946 with her husband alive. She attempts to relive the year without making the mistakes she and her friends made throughout the year, but certain events repeat themselves nonetheless, leaving Sheila to question whether there really is such a thing as fate or not. The story climaxes again on New Years Eve, when through Sheilas interferences over the year, her husband becomes convinced that shes trying to destroy him. He violently confronts her. Her friend William, who believed in Sheilas foresight, shoots her husband with her gun.
