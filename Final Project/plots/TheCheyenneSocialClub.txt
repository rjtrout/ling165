In 1867, John OHanlan and Harley Sullivan are aging cowboys working on open cattle ranges in Texas. OHanlan gets a letter from an attorney in Cheyenne, Wyoming, that his disreputable and now deceased brother, DJ, left him something called The Cheyenne Social Club in his will. After making the 1,000 mile (1,600 km) trek to Cheyenne, OHanlan and Sullivan learn The Cheyenne Social Club is a high-class brothel next to the railroad. OHanlans efforts to close the Club are thwarted, so OHanlan has his brothers lawyer transfer ownership of the Club to Jenny, and he leaves town again, with Sullivan in tow.
