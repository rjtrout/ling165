Alby Sherman is a Jewish man whose father died when he was young. He and his mother run a candy store in Brooklyn, but Alby dreams of opening his own restaurant in Manhattan, a project which will be very expensive. Finding the perfect location, a restaurant whose owner is moving to another location, he asks his wealthy Uncle Benjamin to lend him the money. His uncle imposes an odious requirement of him: Alby will receive the investment money he needs but only if he leaves his blond "shikse" Catholic girlfriend and gets married to a "nice Jewish girl".
