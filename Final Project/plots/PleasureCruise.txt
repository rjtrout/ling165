Andrew Poole (Roland Young) has lost his wealth in the Depression. Seeing his personal estate going under the auction hammer and with no immediate prospects, he plans to release his fianc√©e, Shirley (Genevieve Tobin), from their engagement. Instead, she insists that they marry immediately and subsist on her salary while he finishes a novel, and Andrew accepts. A year later, she is involved with her work and he is a nagging househusband, consumed by jealousy of her life at the office. When matters come to a head, they agree to separate vacations. Shirley departs on a cruise ship, and Andrew furtively gets a job as the ships barber in order to spy on (and disrupt) her dealings with other men. Shirley enjoys a serious flirtation with passenger Richard Orloff (Ralph Forbes) and he asks her to leave her cabin unlocked for him on the night of a big party. Tipsy, Shirley accidentally leaves her door unlocked, so Andrew ties Orloffs cabin door shut and slips into his wifes room in the dark. The next morning she is mortified when Orloff apologizes for having been unable to keep the tryst. She also finds her engraved cigarette case missing, and nervously eyes the cases of other passengers, wondering who was in her room. She decides to return home early, and Orloff arrives at the Pooles home to visit a few moments before Andrew, making for an awkward meeting, as the two had met on the ship. As Orloff makes his excuses and departs, Andrew flashes the cigarette case and all is made clear. Shirley also catches a glimpse of the case, and- pretending to have known all along that Andrew was on board- coyly advises her husband to knock the next time he enters a ladys room. With that, she disappears into her room, and Andrew knocks.
