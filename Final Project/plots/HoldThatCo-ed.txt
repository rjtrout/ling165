Former star quarterback Rusty Stevens believes hes being hired to be prosperous Clayton Universitys new football coach, but finds its actually rundown State College in the same town that is giving him that job. Gov. Gabby Harrigan, who is running for the U.S. Senate, has slashed States budget so much that the school only owns one football. Rusty leads a student protest at the state capitol that ends up in a brawl. The governors opponent in the Senate campaign, Major Breckenridge, capitalizes politically on Harrigans unpopularity at the college. Harrigans bright secretary Marjorie Blake persuades the governor to retaliate by raising funds for State and proposing to build it a 100,000-seat stadium (to be named after him). She also recruits new players for State including a couple of tough wrestlers, promising them government jobs and $500 a game. State begins winning game after game. As a publicity stunt, State even ends up with college footballs first woman, co-ed Lizzie Olsen becoming the teams kicker. Harrigan publicly dares mighty Clayton to a game, challenging his adversary by vowing to quit the Senate race if State loses the game. Breckenridge has no choice but to accept. Alls well until Rusty reveals the unethical payment to players. A depleted State squad is overmatched during the game, but with the score 7-6 in Claytons favor, on the last play of the game Lizzie snatches a batted-down pass in mid-air and crosses the goal line for a game-winning touchdown for State.
