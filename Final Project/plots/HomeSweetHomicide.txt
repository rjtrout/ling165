When gunshots are heard next door, the three children of widowed mystery novelist Marian Carstairs try to help the police, help their mother solve the case or solve it themselves. Polly Walker, an actress, runs from the neighbors house, telling police lieutenant Bill Smith that she had gone there to see Flora Sanford and found her dead. Flora was an agent who represented Polly as well as Marian, whose books feature a detective character with the same name as Bills. Various suspects are considered, including other neighbors and Floras hiding husband, who had fallen in love with Polly and wanted a divorce. The children begin sending anonymous letters, believing they are helping the investigation, until Bill finally persuades them to let him handle the case. He solves it, then expresses a romantic interest in Marian, pleasing the kids.
