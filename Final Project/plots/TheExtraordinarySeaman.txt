A ghostly British naval officer (Niven) persuades four members of the American Navy to launch an attack on Japanese positions, hoping to redeem the family honor and his own tattered record from the First World War. He had been condemned to sail the seas forever after falling down drunk before his first battle in the Great War. With his typical luck he actually succeeds in sinking a Japanese naval vessel -- after it had officially surrendered to the US Navy. As a result, he is seen again consigned to sailing his ship forever, this time in a childrens amusement park lake, to await another chance at redemption.
