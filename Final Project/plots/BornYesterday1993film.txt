A wealthy but crude businessman, Harry Brock, on a trip to the nations capital, is socially embarrassed by his ditzy and rather uncultured showgirl blonde girlfriend, Billie Dawn. He hires a reporter, Paul Verrall, to "teach her the ropes." Harry comes to regret it when Billie not only becomes more savvy, questioning his unscrupulous deals and refusing to cooperate in ways she normally would, but also falls in love with Paul.
