The film relates the fictionalized story of Evelyn Nesbit (Joan Collins). Nesbit was a model and actress who became embroiled in the scandal surrounding the June 1906 murder of her sexual assaulter, architect Stanford White (Ray Milland), by her husband, rail and coal tycoon Harry Kendall Thaw (Farley Granger). Nesbit, who appeared in about a dozen silent films for Fox Film from 1914-1919, served as a technical adviser on The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing.
