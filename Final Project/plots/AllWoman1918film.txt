As described in a film magazine, Susan Sweeney (Marsh), employed in a doll factory, learns that she has inherited a hotel in a small town in the Adirondacks. Picturing the hotel as resembling the most palatial building she has ever seen, she and two girl friends set out for the new home. Consternation reigns supreme when the young women are taken to a ramshackle building, one-half vacant and the other half decorated with persons in various stages of inebriation. The sight of two motherless children prompts Sue to remain and before long she has transferred the place into a fairly decent hotel. She is able to put the bar out of business, reforms the village drunkard, plays Cupid, and wins the love of Austin Strong (Austin).
