Ann Gentry is a social worker wracked with guilt about having been the driver of a car involved in an accident that left her husband severely injured. She gets assigned to a new case: the eccentric and mysterious Wadsworth family. She quickly reveals that she has a special interest the familys youngest memberâ€”a seemingly mentally impaired adult man in his 20s who does not have a name and is called only "Baby." Ann wants to work with Baby, who still acts and is treated like an infant by his mother and sisters, thinking that with the proper treatment he might begin to behave more appropriately for his age group. The Wadsworth clan has been neglectful and abusive to Baby, and while Mrs. Wadsworth has been extremely overprotective of him ever since his father left shortly after his birth, she will not let another caregiver interfere. Eventually, Ann and her mother-in-law take Baby away from his family. His mother and sisters come after them, but Ann and her mother-in-law kill them. They stab the daughters and bury the mother alive under the pool they are building. It is soon revealed why she is so interested in Baby: so he can be a playmate for her husband, who was left with the mental capacity of an infant after his accident.
