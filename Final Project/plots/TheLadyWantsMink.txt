Jim Connors buys his wife a new coat, but neighbor Harvey Jones tops him by buying his own wife Gladys a mink. Nora Connors doesnt mind a bit, but Jim, a debt collector for a department store, becomes self-conscious about his income. An off-hand remark by Gladys gives an idea to Nora to buy a couple of actual minks and bring them home. Although the animals are caged, they create problems with neighbors and with the city, which wants assurances Nora is not starting a fur business. She decides the family should move to the country and do exactly that.
