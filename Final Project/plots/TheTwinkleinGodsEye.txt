A newly ordained minister, Rev. Macklin, catches a ride to the town of Lodestone in a stagecoach carrying six dancehall girls. They are on their way to work for saloon owner Marty Callahan, including one, Laura, who once loved Callahan but no longer does. Macklin explains that his father once built a church in this town, but it burned to the ground. He now wants to rebuild it, but Callahan is opposed and persuades others not to help the preacher in any way. Only the saloon girls attend his first service. A gang of outlaws led by one called Lou robs the saloon and hides the loot in the church. Lou and his men pretend to be religious converts until an opportunity can arise to retrieve their money. Macklin, trying to raise money, enters a rodeo and wins a $300 prize, but Laura also competes, is thrown from a bronco and ends up in a wheelchair. Macklin befriends a band of Indians, who assist in his endeavors. Lou sincerely does become a convert and even Callahan has a change of heart when Macklin returns the stolen money. Laura, seeing a new side of Callahan, agrees to marry him, so Macklin conducts their wedding.
