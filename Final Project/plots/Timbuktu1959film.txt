In 1940, France is at war with Germany. The French have removed large numbers of troops from their African possessions, leaving the way open for revolt. American soldier of fortune Mike Conway (Victor Mature) sees a chance to pay his way back to the United States by gunrunning to hostile Tuaregs. Wearing a slouch hat and bush jacket, Conway is armed with a Thompson sub machine gun and a wristwatch with an alarm engraved "From Conway to Conway". He finds himself walking a razors edge between an anti-French Tuareg leader (John Dehner) keen for Conways supply of weapons but keener to use his tarantulas on his prisoners, a moderate Imam (Leonard Mudie) wanting peace, the local French Foreign Legion commander (George Dolenz), and the commanders attractive wife (Yvonne de Carlo) who Conway cannot keep away from.
