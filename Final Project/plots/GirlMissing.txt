Kay Curtis (Glenda Farrell) and June Dale (Mary Brian) are two showgirls living in the Palm Beach hotel. When June refuses one of her wealthy male friends sexual advances, he chooses to let June and Kay pay for their own hotel bills. They decide to ask Daisy Bradford (Peggy Shannon), who is engaged to millionaire Henry Gibson (Ben Lyon), for help paying the bills because Daisy used to be a fellow showgirl. However, Daisy pretends not to know them. Kay tries to win some money gambling, but ends up losing all their money instead. When they run into Daisys former boyfriend Raymond Fox (Lyle Talbot) in the hotel, he offers them some money to leave town, but June and Kay accidentally miss the train. Later, Henry and Daisy are married, but Daisy goes missing, and a gangster named Jim Hendricks is found dead in the hotels garden. Henry offers a large reward to the public for any information about Daisy. Kay and June decide to find Daisy and claim the reward. After Henry, Kay, and June survive a near fatal car accident, Kay suggests that they wreck the car and declare Henry dead from the automobile accident. When Daisy returns to the hotel after Henrys assumed death, she claims that Henry had drugged and kidnapped her and killed Jim Hendricks. However, Kay pulls a gun on Daisy and she confesses that she was going to run away with Raymond, and when Jim Hendricks tried to stop them, Raymond killed him. Raymond and Daisy are arrested by the police, and Henry gives the reward to Kay. Later, Henry decides to marry June, who he has fallen in love with.
