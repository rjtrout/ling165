The Pike gang steal $30,000 from the Adams Bank, but one of them double crosses the rest of the gang and hides the money in Fort Dodge, Nevada. As Fort Dodge is out of his jurisdiction, Deputy Sheriff Rocky Lane (Allan Lane) takes a vacation there and finds that everything is owned by Skeeter Davis (Chubby Johnson), who knows nothing about the hidden money. But the Pike gang is also in town looking for the money. When settlers come to town, Rocky devises a plan to catch the outlaws and retrieve the money for the Adams Bank.
