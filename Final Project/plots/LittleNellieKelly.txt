In Ireland, Jerry Kelly (George Murphy) marries his sweetheart, Nellie Noonan (Judy Garland) over the objections of her neer-do-well father, Michael Noonan (Charles Winninger), who swears never to speak to Jerry again, even though he reluctantly accompanies the newlyweds to America, where Jerry becomes a policeman, and all three become citizens. Michael continues to hold his grudge against Jerry, even when Nellie dies while giving birth to little Nellie. Years later, Jerry is now a captain on the police force, and little Nellie (also played by Judy Garland) has grown up as the spitting image of her mother. When Nellie becomes enamored of Dennis Fogarty (Douglas McPhail), the son of Michaels old friend Timothy Fogarty (Arthur Shields), the squabbling between Nellies father and grandfather intensifies, as Michael objects to the romance, and finally leaves home because of it. Eventually, the three generations are reconciled, and Nellie and Dennis remain a couple.
