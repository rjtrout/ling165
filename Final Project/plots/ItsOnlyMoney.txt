Lester March (Jerry Lewis) is a 25-year-old orphan who is an electronics repairman. However, his real passion is detective novels, and he dreams of someday becoming a detective himself. His best friend, Pete Flint (Jesse White), is a detective, and they see a television program about a wealthy, single woman, Cecilia Albright (Mae Questel) who is looking for her long-lost nephew. The mention of a $100,000 reward gets their attention. Flint allows March to join him in sneaking into the Albright mansion in hopes of solving the mystery and collecting the reward. During their break-in, Albrights lawyer (Zachary Scott) sees them and recognizes March as being the long-lost nephew, Charles Albright, Jr. The lawyer was responsible for Charles Albright, Sr.s death, and his plan is to marry Cecilia and kill her to inherit the entire fortune. With the help of the butler (Jack Weston), they plan to kill March so he does not interfere with that plan. The family nurse, Wanda Paxton (Joan OBrien), discovers Marchs identity and falls in love with him. The lawyers plans are foiled, Marchs identity is revealed, and Paxton and March are married.
