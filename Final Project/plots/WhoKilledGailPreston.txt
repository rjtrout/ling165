Hardly anybody at the Swing Swing Club is fond of the singer, Gail Preston, and therefore arent particularly upset when she is murdered there. But it is Inspector Tom Kelloggs job to find out what happened and who did it. Suspicion at first falls on a man named Owen, but when he, too, is found dead, bandleader Swing Traynor becomes the prime suspect. Discovering that someone killed Preston by rigging a gun to a spotlight, Kellogg gathers all the suspects into a room and trains the spotlight on each.
