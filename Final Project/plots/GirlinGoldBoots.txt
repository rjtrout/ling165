Michele, a young woman who works at a dead-end job, is convinced by an untrustworthy man named Buz to go with him to Los Angeles, where he claims to have connections that can land her a job as a Go-Go dancer. The two head to L.A., along with a hitchhiker named Critter. Once in Los Angeles, Michele gets a job as a dancer and learns how the club owner and other dancers are connected to the drug trade.
