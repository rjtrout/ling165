In eastern Siberias Dzhugdzhur Mountains, Dieter Von Cunth and his men take control of the X-5 missile, which has a nuclear warhead. In Ecuador, Col. Jim Faith and Lt. Dixon Piper are searching for former Green Beret, Navy SEAL and Army Ranger MacGruber. The two men find him meditating in a chapel, and try to convince him to retrieve the warhead. MacGruber refuses; later that night, MacGruber explodes into a fit of rage after a flashback where Cunth killed his fianc√©e, Casey Fitzpatrick, at their wedding; he then accepts the offer. After having a heated conversation with Faith and Piper at The Pentagon, MacGruber forms his own team to pursue Cunth. MacGruber recruits all but his long-time friend Vicki St. Elmo and Brick Hughes. MacGruber meets Faith and Piper on a tarmac, while his team is in a van with his homemade C-4 explosives. The van explodes, killing the team and MacGruber is removed from the case. MacGruber convinces Piper to form a new team, now including Vicki. The group travels to Cunths nightclub in Las Vegas. MacGruber gets on stage and announces who he is, his intentions, and where he will be the next day. The team sets up a sting operation with Vicki portraying MacGruber. Hoss Bender, one of Cunths henchmen, attacks the van MacGruber and Piper are in, but MacGruber runs down Bender. With Vicki disguised as Bender and Piper disguised as MacGruber, the team breaks into a warehouse to stop Cunth from getting the passwords to operate the rocket. MacGruber distracts the guards and Piper kills most of the men, but is unable to stop the transfer of the pass codes. The team goes to a charity event Cunth is holding and Cunths guards throw MacGruber out. MacGruber returns to the Pentagon where Faith reprimands him and takes him off of the case. Soldiers attack and MacGruber uses Piper as a human shield to survive; Vicki and MacGruber escape. Piper survives since he was wearing a bulletproof vest, but leaves since MacGruber used him as protection. Vicki and MacGruber return to Vickis house where the two have sex. MacGruber goes to his wifes grave in shame, but her ghost gives her blessing. MacGruber then has sex with the ghost of his wife on her tombstone. Upon returning to Vickis house, MacGruber discovers that Cunth has kidnapped her and what Cunths plan is: to bomb the State of the Union address. Cunth calls MacGruber to gloat, but MacGruber traces the call. MacGruber and Piper make their way into Cunths compound. Soldiers capture MacGruber and Piper and bring them to Vicki and the missile. The group overpowers Cunth and his men and MacGruber handcuffs Cunth to a handrail. MacGruber removes the nuclear component and guidance system before his team escapes as the missile explodes. Six months later, MacGruber and Vicki are getting married. Also present at the wedding as ghosts are his dead team members. MacGruber spots a disfigured Cunth with an RPG. MacGruber saves Vicki, and battles Cunth before throwing him off a cliff behind the altar, shooting him with a machine gun and launching a grenade as he falls, incinerating the corpse, and finally urinating on it at the foot of the cliff.
