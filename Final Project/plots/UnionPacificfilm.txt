The 1862 Pacific Railroad Act signed by President Lincoln authorizes pushing the Union Pacific Railroad westward across the wilderness toward California, but financial opportunist Asa Barrows hopes to profit from obstructing it. Chief troubleshooter Jeff Butler has his hands full fighting Barrows agent, gambler Sid Campeau. Campeaus partner Dick Allen is Jeffs war buddy and rival suitor for engineers daughter Molly Monahan. Who will survive the effort to push the railroad through at any cost?
