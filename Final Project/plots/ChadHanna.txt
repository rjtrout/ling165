In the 1840s, Chad Hanna (Fonda), a New York country boy working along the canal in Canastota, New York, joins a travelling Huguenine circus. He falls in love with beautiful bareback rider Albany Yates (Lamour), but she spurns him. Chad then finds himself attracted to another runaway, country girl Caroline Tridd (Darnell). Though everybody assumes that the boy is slow on the uptake, Chad manages to save the circus from financial ruin.
