Stephen Reinhart, an American scientist (Nick Adams), pays a visit to the estate of his British fianc√©es family. He finds a scorched area of countryside near an enormous crater. Local townspeople are hostile toward him and refuse to either drive him to his destination or talk about the family that lives there. The source of all these problems is later revealed to be a radioactive meteorite kept hidden in the basement by his girlfriends father, Nahum Witley (Boris Karloff), who has been using the radiation to mutate plant and animal life, with horrific consequences to his subjects and to members of his family. Nahums wife, Latetia, mutated by the meteorite and driven insane, dies in an attack on Steve and Susan. After Helga, a maid who has been mutated and driven mad by radiation, comes after Nahum, he is mutated after his attacker falls on the meteorite and is killed. The Nahum monster attacks Steve and Susan, but falls from a balcony and bursts into flame when he hits the floor, setting the entire Witley mansion ablaze. Steve and Susan escape the burning mansion, and never look back.
