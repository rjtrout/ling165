Quincy Drew (Garner) and Jason ORourke (Gossett) travel from town to town in the south of the United States during the slavery era. Both men first meet when ORourke sells Drew a horse- a stolen horse belonging to the local Sheriff. They meet again by chance in jail after pulling various con jobs. (In comic relief they both pull out an Ace of Spades as they play cards.) They develop a con together in which Drew claims to be a down-on-his-luck slave owner who is selling ORourke as a slave. Drew gets the bidding rolling, sells ORourke, and the two later meet up to split the profit. ORourke was born a free man in New Jersey and is very well educated. The twist comes when ORourke is sold to a slave trader who is very savvy and intent on taking him down south to make a profit.
