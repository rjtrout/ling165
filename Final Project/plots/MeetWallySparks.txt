Wally Sparks (Rodney Dangerfield) is the host of a sleazy tabloid-style TV talk show who makes Jerry Springer seem gentle by comparison. His show has become so foul that hes alienated his not-especially-discriminating viewers, and his ratings are taking a nosedive. Lenny Spencer (Burt Reynolds), head of the network carrying his show, gives Wally an ultimatum—he has a week to clean up the content and boost his ratings, or his show gets cancelled. Wallys producer, Sandy Gallo (Debi Mazar), comes up with an idea—Floyd Preston (David Ogden Stiers) is the governor of Georgia and a staunch conservative known for his attacks on the lowbrow content of Wallys show, so what better way to demonstrate that Wally is trying to change his ways than having Preston on as a guest? In order to persuade Preston to appear, Wally attends a reception at the Governors Mansion, where he makes the mistake of getting in a drunken game of strip poker with Prestons wife, Emily (Cindy Williams), while somehow involving himself in a plot to blackmail the Governor. And the complications keep coming when Wallys son, Dean, begins a romantic relationship with the Governors daughter.
