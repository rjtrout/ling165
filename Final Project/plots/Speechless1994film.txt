Julia Mann (Davis) and Kevin Vallick (Keaton) are insomniac writers who fall in love, but their romance is thrown for a loop because both are writing speeches for rival candidates in a New Mexico election. Julia is working for the Democratic candidate and Kevin for the Republican candidate. Also complicating matters are Kevins ex-wife (Bedelia), who is on the Republicans campaign trail, and "Mr. Flack Jacket," television war correspondent "Bagdad Bob" Freed (Reeve), Julias estranged fiance, who wants her back.
