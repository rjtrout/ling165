Film student and would-be writer/director Nick Chapman, a native of the Midwest, finds himself the winner of a prestigious student film contest in LA. Overnight, Hollywood VIPs want to make deals with Nick. He settles on a quirky agent to represent him, and signs a deal with a major film studio to make his dream movie. Nick finds the Hollywood studio "process" distasteful, and is forced to make many creative compromises, but he now has money and meets fast, new Hollywood friends. Likewise, the now-affected Nick throws old friends overboard, as his instant success crowds out his old relationships, including that with his girlfriend, Susan. Nicks new world is suddenly turned upside down again when a new studio head decides to cancel his film project. Unable to strike any new film deals, college-educated Nick is reduced to entry-level jobs to pay the bills. Ultimately, a humbled and repentant Nick reunites with old friends, and with Susan, and carves an unexpected path to getting his film produced, this time on his terms.
