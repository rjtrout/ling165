All the Kings Men portrays the dramatic political rise and governorship of Willie Stark, a cynical populist in the American South during the 1930s. The novel is narrated by Jack Burden, a political reporter who comes to work as Governor Starks right-hand man. The trajectory of Starks career is interwoven with Jack Burdens life story and philosophical reflections: "the story of Willie Stark and the story of Jack Burden are, in one sense, one story." The novel evolved from a verse play that Warren began writing in 1936 entitled Proud Flesh. One of the characters in Proud Flesh was named Willie Talos, in reference to the brutal character Talus in Edmund Spensers late 16th century work The Faerie Queene. A 2002 version of All the Kings Men, re-edited by Noel Polk (ISBN 0-15-100610-5), keeps the name "Willie Talos" for the Boss as originally written in Warrens manuscript, and is known as the "restored edition" for using this name as well as printing several passages removed from the original edit. Warren claimed that All the Kings Men was "never intended to be a book about politics."
