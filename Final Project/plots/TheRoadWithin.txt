After his mothers death, Vincent (Robert Sheehan), a teenager with Tourette Syndrome, is enrolled in a behavioural facility by his father. While there he rooms with Alex (Dev Patel), a Brit with obsessive compulsive disorder, and meets Marie (ZoÃ« Kravitz) who is in recovery for an eating disorder. After a child films Vincent with his cellphone and Vincent attacks him, he and Marie are called into Dr. Roses office where she chastises them and Marie steals her car keys. When Alex discovers Marie and Vincent running away in the middle of the night, he attempts to warn Dr. Rose and is kidnapped by them. The three of them head towards the ocean where Vincent hopes to scatter his mothers ashes. However Vincent does not remember the exact location of the beachside trip he and his mother made years ago. The trio finally settle on Santa Cruz as their destination. Dr. Rose informs Vincents father, Robert, that his son has gone missing and rather than allow the police to apprehend them, she and Robert attempt to track them down. Along the way Marie develops a crush on Vincent. When they finally reach the ocean Marie collapses before they can reach the water. Marie is hospitalized and while there, the three are reunited with Dr. Rose and Robert. Marie, who is being force fed and has been restrained asks Vincent to run away with her but Vincent refuses. Instead he has a conversation with his father, who apologizes for treating him poorly and decides to stay in Santa Cruz so he can be near Marie. Rather than leave with Dr. Rose, Alex decides to stay with him.
