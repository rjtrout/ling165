The alien criminal from the first movie is dead, but he left a few eggs which are hatching now. It is explained that on the aliens homeworld, evolution took two parallel paths: half of their race became violent criminals who live only for pleasure (the squid-like alien form briefly glimpsed in the first film), and the other half evolved beyond their base desires and even physical bodies, becoming creatures of pure energy. The good alien (Lloyd Gallagher), who still inhabits Tom Beck’s body (played now by Michael Welden), has been waiting just in case this happened. Unfortunately, his presence in the body has taken a terrible toll on it, draining it of life energy. Additionally, relations with Beck’s daughter Juliet (Kate Hodge), now a cop herself, have deteriorated (possibly due to his bizarre behavior caused by the alien inhabiting his body). But when the killing starts again, both will need to work together - and with a new alien policeman (Raphael Sbarge), who comes to Earth to aid in the struggle - to stop the new generation of aliens.
