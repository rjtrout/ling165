After the town marshal of Antioch is shot by Bob Yauntis, the newly appointed Tom Jackson sets out to apprehend the killer. But when he and his posse get to the ranch of bandit queen Belle Starr, they discover her dead body and the house on fire. Seeing this from a distance, Belles daughter Rose mistakenly concludes Marshal Jackson killed her mother. Rose works as a waitress and Jackson attempts to romance her, but she is cold to his advances. Rose begins pulling off robberies along with Bob, who shoots the ranchs foreman, Lafe Bailey and attempts to avoid detection as a ruthless outlaw called "Bitter Creek" who is being sought by lawmen. Bob eventually turns his wrath on Rose, striking her and holding her captive. Rose escapes and turns to Jackson, who is in love with her. After being taken into custody, Bob is able to wing Jackson with a concealed weapon, whereupon Jackson shoots him dead.
