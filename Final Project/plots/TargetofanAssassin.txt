The film is set in a South African hospital. Top-billed Anthony Quinn plays a male nurse, Hobday, assigned to care for a foreign President (Simon Sabela). With many threats against his well-being, the leader is heavily guarded around the clock. Hobday manages to kidnap his patient for strictly personal gain, unaware that a hired sniper is still attempting to take the life of the foreign leader while in Hobdays custody. This leads to a series of curious plot twists leading to a climactic scene with cable cars on a high plateau ridge.
