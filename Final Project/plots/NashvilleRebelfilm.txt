Arlin Grove (Jennings) has just finished a hitch in the Army and finds hes stranded in the small town of Morgans Corner after being robbed by drunken rednecks. Grove is taken in by pretty Molly Morgan (Mary Frann) and her father, and it doesnt take long for Molly to become infatuated with the rugged stranger while nursing him back to health. Arlin and Molly soon marry, and after playing a few songs at a local honky-tonk, Grove becomes a professional musician when hes offered 75 dollars a week for a standing Saturday night gig. Word about Grove begins to spread, and entertainment lawyer Wesley Lang (Gordon Oas-Heim) offers to take over his management and take him to the big time. Langs paramour Margo (CeCe Whitney) helps give Arlins act some polish, and before long the singer is knocking em dead on the country circuit, and even playing the Grand Ole Opry. Lang takes it upon himself to break up Arlin and Mollys marriage, convinced it would be better for Groves career if he were single, and Molly, now expecting a baby, is left heartbroken. Arlin soon finds himself of the other side of Langs machinations when the manager wrongly suspects his new client is having an affair with Margo; Lang sabotages Grove with a booking at a ritzy supper club, and thinking his career is over, Grove turns to the bottle. An apologetic Margo consoles Arlin, and helps him get back to Molly. (Special thanks to Mark Deming, AMG)
