An attractive woman everybody knows as "Red" runs a restaurant. Her boyfriend Jim Denko, who works at the Kostane steel plant, comes to the restaurant for dinner, but when Red gives his steak away to a customer, words are exchanged and the men get into a fight. It turns out the newcomer is boarding with the McNamara family—in Reds own room, in fact—and Red remains unaware that he is Steve Kostane, nephew of the steel companys owner. Red feels guilty about the fight and buys him a new jacket to replace the one thats ripped. Not until girlfriend Valerie phones to ask for Steve Kostane by name does Red realize who he really is. But when Jim picks her up for a date, Steve sidetracks them by offering Jim money for a guided tour of the plant. Steve begins work there the next day, surprising Jim with his effort. He becomes better acquainted with Red and breaks up with Valerie, but is blamed for a costly mistake at the factory when others dont realize that Steve was actually aiding Reds dad Mac McNamara in an emergency. Red isnt sure how she feels about Steve until her father has another health crisis at work. Steve saves his life, and Red knows this is the man for her.
