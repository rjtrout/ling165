Hollywoods Sunrise Studios is producing a film about a heartbroken composer who creates a modern rhapsody. The head of the music department, Hugo Meyerhold (Felix Bressart), and his young secretary Angela Jones (Marcy McGuire), engage jive clarinetist Ding Dong Williams (Glen Vernon, billed under his real name of Glenn Vernon). Unfortunately Ding Dongs musical skills are limited to improvisation: he cant read or write music at all, and just plays music the way he feels at the moment. Angela spends the rest of the hour-long film trying various schemes to induce Ding Dong to play something sad and soulful, including a fake romance with the studios cowboy star, but all of her attempts fail. Dressed down by the studio boss, and disillusioned by life in Hollywood, Ding Dong watches Meyerhold conducting an orchestral performance of Chopins Fantaisie Impromptu. At the rear of the recording stage, Ding Dong thoughtlessly begins to play in counterpoint to the orchestra. Angela sees this and has the director position a microphone above Ding Dong. The counterpoint melody is exactly what the studio boss wants, and all ends happily.
