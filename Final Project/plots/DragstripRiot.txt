In a beach community near Malibu, California, teenager Rick Martin promises his mother he wont get into any more fights â€” especially like the one that put him in jail a few months back. But when a motorcycle gang begins harassing his drag-racing pals, all hell breaks loose. One of the cyclists is sent hurtling over a cliff, after which Rick gets the blame. Rick gets into a fight, defending a girl, Janet Pearson, and later explains to her how his previous arrest for assault also occurred after coming to the aid of someone else. When gang leader Silva attempts to harm both Rick and Janet, new friends intervene and Mrs. Martin and his grandfather have a new appreciation for her son.
