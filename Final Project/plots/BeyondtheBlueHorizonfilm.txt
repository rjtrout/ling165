Circus lion tamer Jakra and publicist Squidge are intrigued when they hear about Tama, a beautiful woman from Malaya who may be the rightful heiress to an American familys fortune. To find proof of the claim, Jakra and his girlfriend go with Squidge and another interested party, Professor Thornton, to the Malayan jungle where Tama was raised. There they see her tiger, which can swim, and hear tales of a killer elephant responsible for many deaths. Natives, expecting riches, turn against the visitors, but Tamas tiger comes to their rescue. They discover documents that prove Tama to be the legitimate heir to the fortune, then run from the rampaging elephant, which ultimately plunges off a cliff to its death.
