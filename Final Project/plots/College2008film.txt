After Kevin (Drake Bell), a high school senior, gets dumped by his girlfriend Gina (Alona Tal) for being too boring, he does not want to go to the freshman orientation weekend at Fieldmont University, where they had planned to go together. But his best friends Carter (Andrew Caldwell) and Morris (Kevin Covais) convince him that the weekend away will help get his mind off her and hearing stories from their friend Fletcher (Ryan Pinkston) who told them about his college weekend visiting his brother and got laid by three college chicks at once. That convinced Kevin to go to Fieldmont for the freshmen orientation to prove to his ex-girlfriend that he can be fun too and instead of boring. Once they are there, one of the rowdiest fraternities and sororities on campus pretends to recruit them as pledges in return for granting them access to the college party scene. Though forced to put up with the disgusting antics of fraternity brothers Teague (Nick Zano), Bearcat (Gary Owen), and Cooper (Zach Cregger), the guys meet sorority girls Kendall (Haley Bennett), Heather (Camille Mana), and Amy (Nathalie Walker), and sparks fly. But once Teague feels threatened by Kevins new relationship with Kendall who once dated Teague, he takes the pre-frosh humiliation to a greater level and make their lives miserable and start bullying them out of their college. They have no choice, forcing the guys to decide to fight back and payback for ruining their weekend and ruining Morris college scholarship here and Kevins chance go to school here. During the climax, Teague is arrested, Bearcat is superglued to a toilet, and Cooper is ducktaped to a statue naked. In the end back at their high school, Gina, who saw a video sent to her by Kevin having fun at a party at Fieldmont, asks to get back together with her, but he refuses.
