Frank T. Wells, an ex-rodeo champion, is released from prison after serving a 10-year sentence that resulted from a bar fight. He meets with old acquaintances, collects his broken old truck, gets a van to live in and returns to earning a living as a rodeo cowboy, riding his new horse Angel. Scarlett Stuart ia an amateur auto-repair mechanic who lives with her sexually-abusive brother Clem. The two of them are joined by Joe Palmieri in committing a bank robbery. During the robbery, eight policemen are killed. Trying to hide in a motel, the trio are found by the police, who kill Clem and Joe during a shootout, while Scarlett manages to escape. On his way to his van, Frank meets Scarlett who, startled and afraid at first, agrees to help him by fixing his broken truck. In return, he offers the emotionally disturbed woman the opportunity to escape her problems with him. Scarlett has a tattoo "F.T.W.", standing for "Fuck The World," and because these are the same initials of Franks name, she believes that they are meant to be together, and they begin to have a relationship. Living together, they try to make ends meet while laying low from the authorities, but it is more easily said than done, as Scarlett tries to support herself by means of armed robbery.
