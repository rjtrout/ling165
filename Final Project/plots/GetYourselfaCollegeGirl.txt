Terry Taylor (Mary Ann Mobley) is a senior at conservative Wyndham College for Women (fictitious) and, under an assumed name, a successful pop songwriter. After her publisher Gary Underwood (Chad Everett) unknowingly exposes her career, Wyndhams board of trustees—including the college founders grandson, California State Senator Hubert Morrison (Willard Waterman)—condemns Terry for indecent behavior. To distract herself from a possible expulsion, Terry, her friends Sue Ann Mobley (Chris Noel) and Lynne (Nancy Sinatra), and their physical-education instructor Marge Endicott (Joan OBrien) travel to Sun Valley, Idaho for a Christmas-break ski vacation. There they meet Gary and his artist friend Armand (Fabrizio Mioni); Senator Morrison, who wants to solicit the youth vote; and Lynnes husband. The Dave Clark Five, The Animals, and other musical acts perform in the background as Gary and Armand romance Terry and Sue Ann, respectively, while Lynne and her husband spend the entire vacation in their room. Senator Morrison courts Marge and shows that he is a talented dancer, but an embarrassing newspaper photograph threatens his reelection. The others demonstrate his support among the young by holding a successful telephone poll with musical performances.
