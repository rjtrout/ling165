The film opens with Quoyles father tossing him into water, expecting him to naturally swim. The image of Quoyle struggling to swim is reprised several times in later crises. Flash forward to an adult Quoyle (Kevin Spacey), who lives a lonely life and works as an inksetter in a small newspaper in Poughkeepsie, New York. He becomes infatuated with a vivacious local woman named Petal (Cate Blanchett), marrying her and having a daughter they name Bunny. Six years later, the emotionally distant and promiscuous Petal runs off with a lover and Bunny, only to die soon after in a car accident. Bunny is returned by the police to Quoyle, who tell him that Petal had sold their daughter off for US$6,000 to an illegal adoption agency. Only days before Quoyle had received the news that his ailing parents killed one another in a suicide pact. After collecting their ashes, Quoyles aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) arrives wishing to pay her respects to her brother. Agnis is moving to the ancestral family home in Newfoundland, which has been abandoned for 44 years. Realizing that Quoyle is at a total loss through grief, she first offers to stay a few more days and help him through the crisis, and then persuades him to move with her. While struggling to rebuild his life, fix up the derelict house, and care for his daughter, Quoyle meets local resident Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), a widow who has a pre-teen boy with a learning disability. Waveys son and Quoyles daughter become friends, while the two adults become friends, and then more. Wavey has dark secrets in her past, but so does the Quoyle family. To support himself and his daughter, Quoyle takes a job at the local newspaper Gammy Bird as the "Shipping News" correspondent, covering shipping traffic in town, as well as local car crashes. With no experience in journalism, Quoyle struggles to produce decent articles and incurs the dislike of the newspapers second in command, Tert Card (Pete Postlethwaite). An article Quoyle writes about a millionaires yacht docked in town, however, becomes a great success with readers, and the Gammy Birds editor Jack Buggit is so impressed that he commissions him to write a series of articles profiling boats and the personal history of their owners. The story climaxes with a storm that destroys the Quoyle home, and Jack, caught in the rope of a lobster pot while fishing, is believed drowned. His body is recovered, appears to be dead, but is actually in a deep state of shock resulting from hypothermia. During his wake, at his home in front of mourners, he regains consciousness.
