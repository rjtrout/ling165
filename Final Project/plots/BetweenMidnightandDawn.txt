Childhood friends Rocky Barnes (Stevens) and Dan Purvis (OBrien) are Los Angeles prowl car cops on night duty. Barnes is easygoing while Purvis is a cynic who views all lawbreakers as scum. Both men are attracted to radio communicator Kate Mallory (Storm) but she is reluctant to get involved with policemen, her cop father having been killed in the line of duty. One night Rocky and Dan arrest murderous racketeer Ritchie Garris (Buka) but he escapes and swears vengeance. In a thrill-packed climax, Garris makes a desperate escape using a little kid as a shield. After Garris girlfriend (Robbins) is killed stepping in front of his gun, Purvis shoots Garris.
