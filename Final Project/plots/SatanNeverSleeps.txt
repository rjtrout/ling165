In 1949, Catholic priests OBanion (Holden) and Bovard (Webb) are constantly harassed by the Communist Peoples Party at their remote mission outpost in China. Adding to Father OBanions troubles is the missions cook, Siu Lan (France Nuyen), an attractive Chinese girl who makes no secret of her love for him. Under the leadership of Ho San (Weaver Lee), the Communists wreck the mission dispensary and desecrate the chapel. Ho San straps OBanion to a chair and rapes Siu Lan; later, when she gives birth to a son, Ho San displays paternal pride, but refuses to stop persecuting the priests. Only after the villagers revolt and his superiors order the killing of all Christians, including his parents, does Ho San become convinced that Communism will never solve Chinas problems. He decides to smuggle Siu Lan, his son, and the two priests out of the compound, but their journey is halted within a few miles of freedom by a helicopter sent to prevent Ho Sans defection. Before he can be restrained, the aged Father Bovard dons Ho Sans military cap and coat and drives away in the colonels car. He dies in a spray of bullets from the helicopter, but his sacrifice enables the others to escape. Later, at mission headquarters in Hong Kong, OBanion officiates at the wedding of Siu Lan and Ho San and baptizes their child.
