Heythorp is an old ship owner who finds himself on the verge of bankruptcy. He worries about his grandchildren, who are currently being taken care of by the miserly Mrs. Larne, the widowed wife of his son. She asks Heythorp for money, but suspecting that she will use the money on herself, he refuses. Although Heythorp is being hounded by creditors, he manages to get a loan using some shady dealings for which he may be prosecuted. Heythorp wants to use this money for an investment which will provide an independent allowance for his beloved grandchildren, Jock and Phyllis, that can not be touched by the greedy Mrs. Larne. Although he manages to arrange everything so he can die in peace, he is uncovered and threatened with exposure. In the end, Heythorp manages to escape punishment for his underhanded scheme.
