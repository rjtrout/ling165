College student Wes (Gary Busey) who comes from Oklahoma to a university in Minnesota, signs up to participate in a psychological experiment where he meets Susan (Annette OToole). The two are instantly attracted to each other. Besides the problem of their differing socio-economic backgrounds, Susan is also engaged. However, Susans grandfather recognizes her fiances opportunism and when he sides with Wes, their relationship is given more of a chance, in spite of the concern Susans mother has about social status. Susans fiancee is Whitley (John Calvin). As events unfold, her grandfather (Eddie Albert) places his millions on Wes side of the table since Whitleys opportunistic streak is as apparent as the white stripe on a skunk. Maybe the lovers have a chance after all, even if Susans mother (Cloris Leachman) is hung up on social status.
