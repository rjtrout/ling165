During World War II, Chief Aviation Pilot Ned Trumpet (Wallace Beery) is in charge of a blimp at Lakehurst, New Jersey naval base. "Old Gas Bag" brags about his "son," then realizes that he will need someone to impersonate his fictional son. Trumpet finds Jess Weaver (Tom Drake), a young disabled man, arranging for an operation to fix his legs, injured in a riding accident. Afterward, Weaver goes along with the deception and soon earns his Navy wings and commission as an ensign. While on a submarine patrol mission, Trumpet launches an unauthorized attack on a German submarine (ignoring orders sent to break off the attack), but Weavers bomb misses and the submarine fires back, hitting the airship. Trumpet takes over the controls and sinks the submarine. Weaver faces a court-martial for disobeying orders, but Trumpet takes the blame for his actions. After Weaver is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, he gives the DFC ribbon to his "father." Leaving Lakehurst, Weaver gets pilot training at NAS Pensacola. Weaver transfers to Ferry Command. While on assignment in Burma, his aircraft crashes in Japanese territory. Trumpet rushes to the rescue in an airship. Fending off Japanese soldiers, the crew pick up three survivors, the fourth being killed. They are then attacked by three fighters. With the airship punctured and losing gas, the crew jettison as much as they can to gain altitude; when that is not enough to reach clouds to hide in, both Trumpet and Jimmy Shannon (James Gleason) parachute out. Fortunately, Allied P-38 Lightnings arrive. Afterward, Trumpet and Shannon return to base in triumph. Weaver indicates that he will be returning to the lighter-than-air service at Lakehurst, to reunite with his "father."
