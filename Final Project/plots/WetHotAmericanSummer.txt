In 1981, Camp Firewood, a summer camp located near Waterville, Maine, is preparing for its last day of camp. Counselors have one last chance to have a romantic encounter with another person at Camp Firewood. The summer culminates in a talent show. Beth, the camp director, struggles to keep her counselors in order—and her campers alive—while falling in love with Henry, an astrophysics associate professor at Colby College. Henry has to devise a plan to save the camp from a piece of NASAs Skylab, which is falling to Earth. Coop has a crush on Katie, his fellow counselor, but has to pry her away from her rebellious, obnoxious, and obviously unfaithful boyfriend, Andy. Only Gene, the shell-shocked Vietnam war veteran and camp chef, can help Coop win Katie—with some help from a talking can of mixed vegetables. All the while, Gary, Genes unfortunately chosen apprentice, and J.J. attempt to figure out why McKinley has not been with a woman, the reason being that McKinley is in love with Ben, whom he marries in a ceremony in the lake; Victor attempts to lose his virginity with the resident loose-girl Abby; and Susie and Ben attempt to produce and choreograph the greatest talent show Camp Firewood has ever seen.
