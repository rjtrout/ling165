A drug bust is about to go down and Chicago cop Tony Church is on the case. Things go horribly wrong, though. His fellow officers get slaughtered and Church takes the blame, getting fired from the force. Della, a high-priced hooker, happened to be in the hotel at the time and caught a good look at the killers face. Now shes scared and needs protection. She tracks down Church, who cant find employment other than as a security guard. Della offers him a fee to be her bodyguard until the killer is caught. The lunatic everyones after is called Dancer, partly because he likes to bust a move in front of a mirror whenever he gets the chance. A former police officer, Roger, is around to give Church advice and assistance, at least until its revealed that Roger is now totally corrupt. Church manages to save Dellas life, and after quite a bit of bickering, they discover a mutual attraction as well.
