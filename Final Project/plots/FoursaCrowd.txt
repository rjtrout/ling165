Meanwhile, Lansford hopes to gain tycoon John Dillingwells (Walter Connolly) business for his public relations firm, and uses his position at Buckleys paper to drum up good press for Dillingwell. In the process, he discovers that Dillingwells granddaughter Lorri (Olivia de Havilland) is Buckleys fianc√©e. Lansford decides to try to charm Lorri while Christy makes a play for Buckley.
