Near the end of the Korean War in 1953, a new replacement, Private Loomis, is assigned to an infantry company in the front line. He notices a quiet Private Endore and is warned by others in the company not to speak to him. Once night falls, Loomis notices Endore in dark clothing and face paint, and becomes aware he routinely infiltrates the enemy lines to gather information and spread terror amongst the enemy by killing enemy soldiers with his knife. Endores odd ritual of drawing a circle around the body with his knife may indicate that he is, in fact, a serial killer. Company Commander Captain Pratt lets Endore act independently. Endores only friend is a Korean orphan whom Loomis wishes to place in an orphanage, a desire which brings him into conflict with Endore. Tension increases when the armistice occurs and the others in the unit wish to return home to the United States, but Endore does not.
