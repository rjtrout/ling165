At a Manhattan teaching hospital, the life of Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), the Chief of Medicine, is in disarray: his wife has left him, his children dont talk to him, and his once-beloved teaching hospital is falling apart. The hospital is dealing with the sudden deaths of two doctors and a nurse. These are attributed to coincidental or unavoidable failures to provide accurate treatment. At the same time, administrators must deal with a protest against the hospitals annexation of an adjacent and decrepit apartment building. The annexation is to be used for a drug rehabilitation center; the buildings current occupants demand that the hospital find them replacement housing before the building is demolished despite the building being condemned sometime before. As Dr. Bock complains of impotence and has thoughts of suicide, he falls in love with Barbara Drummond (Diana Rigg), a patients daughter who came with her father from Mexico for his treatment. This temporarily gives Dr. Bock something to live for after Barbara confronts him. The deaths are discovered to have been initiated by Barbaras father (Barnard Hughes), as retribution for the "inhumanity" of modern medical treatment. Drummonds victims would have been saved if they had received prompt, appropriate treatment â€” but they did not. Dr. Bock and Barbara use a final, accidental death of a doctor at the hospital to cover Drummonds misdeeds. Barbara makes plans to fly her and her father back to Mexico. Dr. Bock at first intends to go with them, but at the last minute insists on staying behind to try to re-organize the hospital so that it will not descend into total chaos.
