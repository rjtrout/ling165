High school valedictorian-to-be Henry Burke (Matt Bush) takes his first hit of pot with his ex-best friend Travis (Sean Marquette), only to learn that, due to a spelling bee champions recent use of marijuana, their high school is conducting a drug test where anyone caught under the influence of anything will be expelled. Travis knows of a psychotic drug dealer, known as Psycho Ed (Adrien Brody), who carries an exclusive kind of pot called "kief", and the two boys steal the stash and intend on getting the whole school high, to invalidate the drug test and save Henrys future. But Psycho Ed is right on their trail and so is Dr. Gordon, the school dean.
