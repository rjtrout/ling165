Benedict High Schools cheerleaders are not shy or sweet. The football team knows them well - and Billy, the schools disturbed janitor, would like to. In the locker room, the girls shower and dress, unaware of the eyes which secretly watch them. They do not know that a curse has been placed on their clothes and that their trip to the first big football game of the season might sideline them for eternity.
