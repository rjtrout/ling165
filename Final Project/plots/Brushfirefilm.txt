Two American World War II veterans Jeff (John Ireland) and Chevern (Everett Sloane) reside as planters in an unnamed Southeast Asian nation. They are drawn into a conflict with a group of guerrillas led by Martin (Carl Esmond) and Vlad (Howard Caine) who have abducted a young American couple Tony (Al Avalon) and Easter (Jo Morrow) Banford. The two use their jungle fighting expertise and knowledge of the local land to rescue them and wipe out the guerrillas. Jeff states that the rescue effort was worth the high cost in lives because it kept an uprising from developing into a rebellion.
