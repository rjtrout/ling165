Trisha Rawlings (Lily Tomlin) is a wealthy, middle-aged Beverly Hills socialite suffering from loneliness following a separation from her philandering husband Stu (Bert Kramer). One day at a pharmacy, she meets Vick "Strip" Sunset (John Travolta), an indigent, suave young drifter whom she met briefly in the recent past when he worked as a car valet. He develops an infatuation with her, following Trisha to her Malibu beach house, hanging around despite her cold demeanor and offering her pills in an attempt to woo her. Trisha is initially annoyed by Strips flirtatiousness but eventually reciprocates his affections, although not quite to the same degree he feels for her. When he leaves her house, she goes after him and they have lunch. Thus officially begins their relationship, which proves to be rocky. She enjoys time spent with him, but the difference in age and class has her feeling a sense of shame. When they attend a photography exhibition together, they run into Stu, which makes the situation uncomfortable. Once Trisha and Strip return home, they argue over their relationship. Strip leaves, but Trisha tracks him down and they reconcile.
