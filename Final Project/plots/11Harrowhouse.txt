In England, a small-time diamond merchant (Grodin) is unexpectedly offered the chance to supervise the purchase and cutting of an extremely large diamond to be named for its wealthy owner (Howard). When the diamond is stolen from him, he is blackmailed into pulling off a major heist at "The System," located at 11 Harrowhouse, with the help of his beautiful and wealthy girlfriend (Bergen). The key figure in the theft, however, is the inside man Watts (Mason) who works in the vault at The System. He is dying of cancer and wants to leave his family financially secure. Although "The System" has an elaborate system of defenses and alarms against intruders, the robbery is carried out at night by gaining access to the roof from an adjacent property and threading a hose down a conduit into the vault, where Watts uses it to vacuum up thousands of rough diamonds out of their drawers. The thieves leave before the robbery is discovered, and when found in the vault in the morning, Watts claims to have eaten the gems. Most of the loot is buried in concrete, to prevent it flooding the market.
