June Collyer (her last film) plays a meddlesome reporter who claims she can recognize "the fiend" because she saw his face in the fog (in a mirror). She becomes his target. Fellow reporter (Lloyd Hughes) tries to protect her, along with a ditzy photographer (Al. St. John). After there is a murder in a theater, the playwright (Lawrence Gray) pitches in to help solve the case.
