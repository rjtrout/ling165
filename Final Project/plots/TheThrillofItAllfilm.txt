The story centers around suburban housewife Beverly Boyer and her husband, a successful obstetrician and devoted family man, Gerald. Beverly is offered the opportunity to star in a television commercial advertising Happy Soap. After a shaky start, she gets a contract for nearly $80,000 per year ($639,500 today) to appear in weekly TV commercials. Soon the soap company places greater and greater demands on the unlikely TV star. Gerald resents the fact that the appearances are taking up an increasing amount of her time, and becomes jealous of the level of attention that her new-found stardom has brought her. Their relationship slowly deteriorates, and Gerald leaves her after unintentionally driving his 1958 Chevrolet convertible into the surprise $5,000 ($40,000 today) swimming pool the soap company built where their garage used to be. Gerald later returns, only to enact psychological warfare, making Beverly jealous by pretending that he is drinking and carousing with multiple women. Beverly decides to give up her lucrative career and return to her "philandering" husband and her life as a rich doctors housewife.
