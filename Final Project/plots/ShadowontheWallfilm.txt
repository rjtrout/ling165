Child Susan Starrling (Gigi Perreau) is the sole witness to a killing, but the shock causes her to suffer amnesia about the event. Her father David (Zachary Scott) is convicted of first degree murder of his wife. However, psychiatrist Caroline Cranford (Nancy Davis) is convinced she can cure the young girl and begins to suspect that another person is guilty. That person is Dell Faring (Ann Sothern), who became incensed after brother-in-law David discovered that while he was away serving his country, wife Celia (Kristine Miller) was having an affair with Dells fiance, Crane Weymouth. A resentment already existed between the sisters because Dell felt this was not the first time Celia had selfishly taken something from her. Celia knocked David unconscious during a quarrel over her infidelity. Dell then arrived, picked up a gun David brought home from the war and killed her sister with it. With no memory of what happened, David can only assume he was the one who shot Celia, so he accepts the jurys verdict and the judges sentence that he be put to death. Susan, who saw the murder from the door but repressed the memory, is haunted by the image of a shadow on the wall. A distraught Dell, realizing that Dr. Cranford is trying to restore the girls memory, attempts to murder the child. When she fails, she adopts Susan instead. Dell casts a shadow on the wall that triggers Susans memory.
