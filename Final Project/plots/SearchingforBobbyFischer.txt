Josh Waitzkins family discovers that he possesses a gift for chess and they seek to nurture it. They hire a strict instructor, Bruce Pandolfini (played by Ben Kingsley), who aims to teach the boy to be as aggressive as chess legend Bobby Fischer. The title of the film is a metaphor about the characters quest to adopt the ideal of Fischer and his determination to win at any price. Josh is also heavily influenced by Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne), a speed chess hustler whom he meets in Washington Square Park. The two coaches differ greatly in their approaches to chess, and Pandolfini is upset that Josh continues to adopt the methods of Vinnie. The main conflict in the film arises when Josh refuses to accept Pandolfinis misanthropic frame of reference. Josh then goes on to win on his own terms.
