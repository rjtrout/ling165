In 1962, con man Chester MacFarland and his wife Colette tour Greece and visit the Acropolis of Athens. There, they meet Rydal Keener who scams tourists while working as a tour guide. The MacFarlands discover that Rydal is an American and invite him to dinner. Rydal, intrigued by the couples wealth and Colettes beauty, accepts their invitation and brings along a girlfriend. Colette likes Rydal but Chester does not trust him. After dinner, they part but Rydal goes back to their hotel to return a bracelet that Colette left in their shared taxi. Meanwhile, a private detective hired by victims of Chesters investment swindles goes to the MacFarlands hotel room and demands that Chester repay their money. The detective pulls a gun and Chester kills him by accident in a brief struggle when the detective falls and hits his head. While Chester is trying to stow the body in the detectives hotel room, Rydal finds him in the corridor. Chester asks Rydal for his help, pretending that he found the detective drunk and unconscious in the lobby. When the two of them try to get the dead detectives body into his hotel room, they are seen by an elderly couple who think that Chester and Rydal are only trying to help a drunk man to get into his hotelroom and so they give them a friendly "Good evening!". In their panic, Colette and Chester hastily pack their suitcases and leave the hotel, without checking out. They also leave their passports behind at the hotel front desk. Rydal takes the MacFarlands to see a friend who can furnish false passports to replace those they left at the hotel. He suggests waiting for the counterfeit documents in Crete. In the capital city Iraklion, they cannot check into a hotel without identification papers and so they spend the evening at a restaurant where Chester gets drunk while watching Rydal and Colette dance and grow close and they all sleep the night on the quayside. Next morning, they travel by bus to Chania where Colette visits Rydals room while her husband sleeps; it is left ambiguous as to whether they have sex. On the way back to Iraklion, Colette believes someone has recognized her from newspaper pictures of the Americans who fled the hotel in Athens and runs off the bus at a stop. Chester and Rydal follow and together they walk to the ruins of Knossos. It begins to rain and they seek shelter. Chester lures Rydal into an underground labyrinth and knocks him out. As Chester emerges alone from the labyrinth, Colette assumes that he has killed Rydal. She then refuses to go any further with Chester telling him that this is no way to live, fleeing from one part of the world to another, always afraid that they will be found out by the police, especially now two people have been murdered. Chester tries to force her, grabbing her arm, but as she struggles, she loses her balance and falls down the wall that the stairs are built on. Chester rushes down to her but she is dead. He takes her in his arms and cries out in grief. When Rydal comes to in the morning, he discovers Colettes dead body and while leaving, is seen by a group of students and their guide. He also discovers Chesters coat, hat and sunglasses and puts them on. Chester has rushed to Iraklion to pick up the passports paying Rydals friend $2,500. Rydal arrives in Knossos and tracks down Chester. The two realize that they are bound together by the detectives death, the acquisition of false passports and Colettes death. If either is arrested, he will implicate the other. As they take the ship back to Athens, they have a conversation while standing at a railing, looking out over the sea. Chester offers Rydal $10,000 to keep him quiet. Rydal then reveals that he "never wanted Chesters money. He wanted Chesters wife." Chester grabs him by the throat and nearly pushes Rydal overboard telling him to never talk about his wife again. After arriving in Athens, they go to the airport, where Chester pretends to buy them both tickets to Frankfurt. He says he is going for a drink and boards a plane to Istanbul leaving Rydal with a suitcase containing documents that will tie him to Colette. Rydal realizes that Chester has probably reported him to the police anonymously and he flees the airport and appears to have escaped the police. Rydal locates Chester in Istanbul and demands a meeting in the Grand Bazaar threatening to go the police unless Chester pays him off. In fact, Rydal has been arrested. The authorities have made him wear a wire and expect him to extract a confession from Chester. At their rendezvous, Rydals insistent questioning makes Chester suspicious. Sensing a trap, he flees and a chase through the dark ensues begins with both Chester and Rydal fleeing the police. A policeman shoots Chester who, as he lies dying, speaks into Rydals wire tap admitting responsibility for the two deaths and exonerating Rydal. After Rydal is released, he asks the police where Chester will be buried. They answer that as they havent been able to trace any next of kin, Chester will be buried in Istanbul. When they ask Rydal why he wants to know, Rydal answers: "I thought Id go to his funeral". When he visits Chesters grave, he buries Colettes bracelet there at the tombstone.
