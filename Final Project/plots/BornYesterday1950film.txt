Uncouth tycoon Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) goes to Washington, D.C. with his brassy girlfriend, Emma "Billie" Dawn (Judy Holliday), and his crooked lawyer, Jim Devery (Howard St. John), to "influence" a politician or two. The lawyer also presses Harry to marry Billie on the grounds that a wife cannot be forced to testify against her husband. Harry becomes disgusted with Billies ignorance and lack of manners (though he himself is much worse). He hires a tutor for herâ€”journalist Paul Verrall (William Holden). Blossoming under Pauls encouragement and her own hard work, Billie learns about literature, history, politics and the law, and turns out to be much smarter than anybody knew. She begins to think for herself and apply her reading and learning to her life situation. The two begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, Devery has persuaded Harry to sign over many of his assets to Billie to hide them from the government. When Harry needs to get them back, he comes into conflict with Billies new-found independence. She and Paul use her leverage to escape from Harrys domination. She promises to give him back his property little by little as long as he leaves them alone. Billie and Paul marry.
