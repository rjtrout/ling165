Bruce Keene works in the advertising department of Beyers and Company, which produces cereal, among other things. His heavy drinking conflicts with his work output. He and his fiancé, Penny Wilton, who also works in the advertising department, believe that a boost in the sales of Beyers cereal can come about if Keene draws a series of pictograms to be printed on the cereal boxes over a 30-week period. Customers who solve all 30 pictograms will be eligible to compete for a $100,000 prize. Willy Beyers, the company president, agrees to the concept, and the contest is launched. The contest is very successful, but Keene tires of creating a new pictogram in the waning weeks of the contest. He resumes his heavy drinking in bars. Wilton fears for her fiancés future, hires a small-time hood, Softy Blane, to feign Keenes kidnaping so that while in the countryside he will finish the series of pictograms. Blane works for Steve Devers, a gangster who has taken an interest in manipulating the contest in order to win the $100,000. Blane doublecrosses Wilton, and really kidnaps Keene, taking him to Devers hideout. Keene works in captivity to expose his kidnappers by drawing pictograms that tell of his situation that are sent to Beyers. Wilton understands the clues, and uses them to puzzle out where Keene is being held. She leads the police to the hideout, and after a shootout, Keene is rescued. Reunited with his fiancé, he promises to reform his drinking ways and marries Wilton.
