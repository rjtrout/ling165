In the aftermath of a big battle during World War II, Brigadier General Charles Lane (Kent Smith), Master Sergeant Murphy "Murph" Savage (Glenn Ford) and Corporal Chan Derby (Red Buttons) find themselves cut off. The general takes over a farmhouse belonging to annoyed Frenchwoman Simone (Taina Elg). Lane determines that there is a gap in the lines and decides to organize a defense from whatever stragglers he can gather together. Shortly afterwards however, he is killed saving Murphs life. The first American soldier who shows up, Corporal Terry Sellers (Dean Jones), mistakes Murph for Lane (Murph is holding the generals helmet), giving him an idea. Recalling Lanes assessment that leadership is desperately needed to rally the disorganized troops, Murph masquerades as the general, with Derby and Simones reluctant help. Murph manages to repulse a couple of German attacks spearheaded by tanks, all the while avoiding Private Orville Hutchmeyer (Tige Andrews), who knows Murph and has a grudge against him. At the end of the engagement, Murph is knocked out by shrapnel, allowing him to "die" and resume his real identity with no one the wiser.
