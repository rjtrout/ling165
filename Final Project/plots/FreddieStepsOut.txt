Freddie Trimball is a high school student. He happens to bear an amazing resemblance to Frankie Troy, one of the most popular young singers in the country. Tired of working and tired of being pursued by bobby-soxers and other fans, Frankie tells his managers he needs a break. They try to discourage him while Freddies classmates come up with a hoax, claiming that "Frankie" has gone back to school. Mix-up after mix-up follows, with Freddies girlfriend, Dodie Rogers, every bit as confused as Frankies wife, who has a baby. It all comes to a head when Frankie ends up singing in a school show.
