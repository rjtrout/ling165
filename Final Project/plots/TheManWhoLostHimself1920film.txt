As described in a film magazine, American Victor Jones (Faversham) finds himself penniless and stranded in London. He meets the Earl of Rochester (Faversham), and the similarity between the two is so noticeable that even friends mistake Jones for the Earl. The Earl is estranged from his wife (Hopper) and family, owes great sums of money, and is considered in a bad light by acquaintances. He gets Jones drunk and sends him to the Rochester mansion, and then commits suicide. Until Jones receives a note written by the Earl prior to his death, he does not perceive his position. After reading the note, Jones immediately begins to pose as the Earl, but later reveals this scheme. However, he has fallen in love with the Earls widow and they decide to reside in the United States.
