Successful American lawyer Robert Hayward (William Holden) is in Kenya because his ex-wife Christine (Capucine) is having some problems with their eleven-year-old daughter Tina (Pamela Franklin), who has a great affinity with Africa, its customs and its wildlife. Tina spends much of her time in the company of the lion she raised from a cub. Christine has remarried and her new husband John Bullit (Trevor Howard), a former big-game hunter, now manages a large Kenyan animal preserve. Hayward and Bullit compete for the romantic affection of Christine and for the daughterly affection of Tina. The son of a local tribal chief sees Tina as a potential future wife, and his efforts to impress her prove to be disastrous.
