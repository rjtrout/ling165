Warren Nefron (Jerry Lewis) is a klutz who cannot do anything right. He tells his psychiatrist, Dr. Pletchick (Herb Edelman), his problems. Through a series of flashbacks the viewer sees Nefrons life story. Warren is such a failure that even his many attempts to commit suicide fail. Eventually the psychiatrist uses hypnosis to cure Warren. Although Warren is now cured, the psychiatrist has experienced transference and now has all of Nefrons problems. The story ends with Warren and a young woman attending a film called Smorgasbord.
