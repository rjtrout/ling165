After losing his job, his girlfriend, and his sanity, salesman Tommy Wilhelm (Williams) packs up for New York City to try to repair the pieces of his broken life. His skill as a salesman comes naturally, but his strained relationship with his father (Joseph Wiseman) certainly does not. Tommy must face the father he never really knew while trying to balance the new life that he attempts to carve out for himself.
