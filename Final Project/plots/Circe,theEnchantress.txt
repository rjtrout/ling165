Cecilie Brunner (Murray) was once a good natured woman. After the death of her mother, she becomes a cynical vamp. She falls in love with surgeon Peter Van Martyn (James Kirkwood, Sr.). Peter makes clear he does not approve her life style. This results in Cecilie even partying more. She ends up gambling her home away. Realizing her life style isnt appropriate, Cecilie changes back into a sweet woman. However, she is paralyzed after being hit by a car, while saving a child. It is Peter who heals her.
