Not content, Christina quickly seduces Jack, recording them as they have intercourse on his Harley Davidson motorcycle. Not soon after, Hill is murdered, and police suspicions fall on Jack as being the culprit, he denies this, and tells the detectives that Christina was also having an affair with Ashby at the time of her husbands death.
