A number of stagecoach holdups has taken place in Arizona Territory. One of them occurs when Mike Ryan, an undercover agent for the stage line, is on board -- posing as a paying customer. Another passenger on that trip is the sheriffs daughter, Molly Jones. During the robbery, one of the bandits lets his bandana slip, revealing his face. Because the gunmans identity is now known, he is killed by Velvet Clark, the gangs leader. Once in town, Clark assumes the role of a respectable member of the community. When the townspeople become fed up with the crime spree, they call for the resignation of the Sheriff, Tom Jones. He asks to be given one more chance and, once granted, deputizes Ryan. Jones finds evidence that implicates Clark. When confronted, Clark kills the sheriff and escapes. It is left for Ryan to track down Clark. The two have a showdown at Gunsight Ridge. During the ensuing gunfight, Clark is killed. Ryan returns to the Jones Ranch and expresses regret to Molly for being unable to prevent her fathers murder. At the same time, he reveals that he has been offered the job of sheriff and asks her opinion. When she approves, he announces that he will accept the position, implying the two will marry and settle down.
