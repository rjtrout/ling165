The film contains a preface with the following paragraphs:  This story is a true narrative, based on actual fact, mirroring what is happening to thousands of families throughout the land. While "THE STRUGGLE" is a powerful indictment of bootleg liquor, emphasizing its devastating effect on American Youth, it is not presented as a preachment either for or against Prohibition. The picture however, does raise these questions: If Prohibition is the success that people claim it is, how could all these things have happened? Is mans struggle against intemperance controllable by law, or is it solely a matter of individual character?  The story then begins in 1911 and extends into the Prohibition era. Jimmie got into the habit of drinking (bootleg liquor) partly due to the Prohibition law. When he falls in love with and proposes to Florrie, he makes a vow "not to take another drink". The young couple gets married, has a daughter and enjoys a happy family life until Jimmie starts drinking again due to circumstances. As Jimmie descends into alcoholism, his family falls into disarray. His sister Nan is forced to break off engagement with Johnny due to Jimmies alcohol-fueled bad behavior. Finally, Florrie manages to save the family and nurtures Jimmie back to his feet. Nan and Johnny are reunited.
