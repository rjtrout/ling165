A leg injury causes Los Angeles power line worker Hank McHenry to give up field work and accept a promotion to foreman. His crew includes good friend Johnny Marshall and old Pop Duval. Pop is killed during an ice storm. His daughter Fays seeming indifference irritates Johnny, but Hank is attracted to her. A hostess in a nightclub, Fay accepts money from Hank and also his marriage proposal, even though she does not love him. Before a project that takes them to Boulder Dam, an injury befalls Johnny. He is taken into Hanks home, where Fay makes a play for him. Johnny resists her. Fay decides to leave Hank, but after she is arrested in a raid at the club, Johnny pays her bail and Hank misconstrues the situation, believing Johnny has betrayed him. During a work emergency, Hank climbs with his bad leg to reach Johnny and start a fight, during which Hank falls to his death. Johnny is left to decide whether he is attracted to Fay or repelled by her.
