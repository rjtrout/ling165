Successful author Christopher "Kit" Madden (Claudette Colbert) travels to Los Angeles to work on the film adaptation of her best-selling book Here is Tomorrow. It is supposed to star Cary Grant as the hero Mark Winston and Lana Turner, but Grant has just dropped out and the producer thinks they need an unknown actor to play Winston. On a train to Hollywood Kit meets two Marines, Captain "Rusty" Thomas (John Wayne) and 1st Lieutenant "Dink" Watson (Don DeFore). She considers Rusty the best choice to play Mark Winston, but he is dismissive of her book: she wrote a political allegory and he does not believe Cary Grant would refuse Lana Turner for 400 pages. Unsure how he will react if he discovers she is a famous writer, she keeps her identity secret (saying her name is "Kitty Kloch"). During their journey across the country on trains and cars the trio end up in various comedic and dramatic situations. When Rusty finally learns the truth, he thinks that she has been using him just so he would be in the motion picture. Nonetheless, after a number of missteps, the couple eventually are able to resolve their differences.
