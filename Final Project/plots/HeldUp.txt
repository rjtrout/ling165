While on a road trip in the Southwest, Rae (Long) discovers that her man, Michael (Foxx), spent the $15,000 they set aside for a home on a vintage Studebaker. Rae promptly dumps Michael at a convenience store and hops a ride to the airport. Soon after, Michael loses the car when a young kid cons him out of the keys. Michael soon finds his day going from bad to worse when hes caught up in a botched robbery at the convenience store where hes now stranded. The cops (local vigilantes) show up ready for a gunfight. Michael finds himself trying to convince the gunman (Yáñez) to let him and the other hostages go, all while trying to plan how to get to the airport before Raes flight leaves.
