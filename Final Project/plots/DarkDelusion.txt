Dr. Gillespie (Barrymore) asks a young surgeon, Dr. Tommy Coalt (Craig), to go to the small town of Bayhurst to replace a local doctor while he is on assignment to the Occupation effort in post-World War II Europe. There, Coalt is asked to sign mental-health commitment papers on a beautiful young socialite, Cynthia Grace (Bremer). Coalt thinks there is something amiss, and begins his own investigation.
