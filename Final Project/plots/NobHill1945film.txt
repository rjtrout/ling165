Sally Templeton (Vivian Blaine) sings at Tony Angelos (George Raft) popular turn-of-the-century nightclub in San Francisco, which is called the Gold Coast. She is also in love with Tony. One day, a young girl, Katie Flanagan (Peggy Ann Garner), just off the boat from Ireland, arrives looking for her uncle. Informed that he has died, Katie is about to be sent back by Tony on the next ship until Sally persuades him to let the girl stay a while. Tony falls for Nob Hill socialite Harriet Carruthers (Joan Bennett) and agrees to support her brother, Lash (Edgar Barrier), who is a candidate for district attorney. Business acquaintances are upset because Lash might shut down clubs like theirs if elected DA. Sally objects to the attention he is paying Harriet and takes a job singing in another club. Katie misses her terribly. After the election, Tony discovers that Harriet has no interest in a future with someone like him. He grows despondent and turns to drink. Sally reconciles with Tony, who is also heartened by Lashs acknowledgment that he intends to investigate only law-breaking operations, not Tonys, which is respectable. All is well until Katie runs away, but after a desperate search in Chinatown for the child, Tony and Sally finally find her.
