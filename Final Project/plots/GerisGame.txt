In an empty park during autumn, the title character, Geri (voiced by Bob Peterson), is an elderly man who plays a game of chess against himself, "becoming" each of the players in turn by moving to the other side of the chessboard, where he changes his personality and either puts on or takes off his glasses to show this change.  As the game progresses, it seems as though there are two people playing; at one point, the hands of both "opponents" are in frame. The aggressive Black Geri (without the glasses) soon gains the upper hand over the more docile White Geri (with them), capturing every piece except his king and putting him in check.  However, White Geri outsmarts Black Geri by faking a heart attack to distract him and spinning the board around. While Black Geri is still distracted, White Geri checkmates what is now his opponents king. Finding that now he is the one with only his king left and discovering what has happened, Black Geri resigns the game and hands over a set of false dentures as the prize. White Geri puts them in, then chuckles and grins in his victory, before the camera pulls back to reveal that he is alone at the chessboard.
