Kreton (Jerry Lewis) is an alien from outer space who is fascinated by human beings. Against the wishes of his teacher, he repeatedly visits Earth. During his latest visit, his teacher reluctantly agrees to allow him to stay and study the humans. Kreton becomes friends with a suburban family and stays with them after they agree to keep his alien status a secret. Along the way, he falls in love with their daughter (Joan Blackman). However, there is a force field around him that prevents any physical contact. His race has abolished any form of affection. After repeatedly breaking his teachers rule against never getting involved in humans lives, all of Kretons powers are stripped away. This so that he can discover for himself that being human comes with other, less desired, emotions like pain, sadness, and jealousy. Once his cover is blown on Earth, and he is reported to the police, Kreton decides that those emotions are not worth the trouble, so he returns to his own planet.
