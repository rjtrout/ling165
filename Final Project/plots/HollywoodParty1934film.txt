Jungle movie star "Schnarzan" (Durante), a character in parody of Tarzan, is advised by his manager he needs new lions for his pictures, as his old ones are "worn out". At a wild Hollywood party with many varied guests, including a "lion provider", hilarity ensues. After it all gets out of hand, Schnarzan awakens to find he is just plain old Durante, who had a strange dream.
