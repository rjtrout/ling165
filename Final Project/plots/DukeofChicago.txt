Chicago former boxing champion Jim Brody is lured from his retirement and loving relationship with fianc√©e Helene back to the ring to face the current champion, Steve "Killer" Bronski. Brodys financial difficulties and failing private business have left him desperate for money, with Helene leaving on their planned cruise around the world without him in anger at his attempts to cancel it. He accepts the fight with the financial assistance of gangster Tony Russo. Helene, learning this, ends her relationship with Brody via letter, but it is intercepted by an associate of Brody before it reaches him. Russo pressures Brody to throw the fight for financial gain through the bookies. Brody achieves eventual victory, though being badly beaten during the fight. He is later assaulted and nearly murdered by Russos men while recuperating in hospital. Russo and his gang are arrested. Brody, now without Helene, falls for and becomes engaged to her sister, Jane.
