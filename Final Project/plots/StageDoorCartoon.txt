Elmer Fudd attempts to catch Bugs with a carrot on a fish hook, but the tables are turned on Elmer when Bugs attaches the hook to Elmers pants, causing Elmer to reel himself in. An angry Elmer chases Bugs to a Vaudeville theater, where Bugs performs a series of entertainment themed tricks on Elmer: Bugs disguises himself as a can-can dancer, but Elmer sees through the disguise. Bugs tricks Elmer into performing a high-diving act into a glass of water, and Elmer is also fooled into performing a stage striptease down to his boxers. Bugs disguises himself as a southern sheriff just as a real southern sheriff arrives to arrest Elmer for "indecent southern exposure". Before leaving the theater, a Bugs Bunny cartoon begins on the stages movie screen and the sheriff decides to stay and watch it. Elmer appears to get wise when the cartoon shows the scene where Bugs disguises himself as the sheriff. Elmer, thinking the sheriff is Bugs Bunny in disguise, calls the sheriff an impostor and pulls off his clothes, only to realize he has just disrobed a real sheriff. As the furious sheriff proceeds to lead Elmer out of the theater with his shotgun ("Youll swing for this, sir!"), Bugs conducts the orchestra in a big finale.
