The film, considered a screwball comedy, centers on a reporter, Hildebrand Hildy Johnson (Pat OBrien) and his editor (Adolphe Menjou), who hope to cash in on a big story involving an escaped accused murderer, Earl Williams (Stone) and hide him in a rolltop desk while everybody else tries to find him.
