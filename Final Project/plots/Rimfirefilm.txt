The plot is a mystery revolving around Captain Tom Harvey, an undercover army agent played by James Millican, who is investigating the theft of army gold shipments. During his undercover investigations, Harvey takes on the job of deputy sheriff and is drawn into discovering the source of a ghost who is terrorizing the town. The ghost is apparently the manifestation of a gambler who was wrongly convicted and hanged for the gold thefts.
