Four co-eds from snowbound Penmore College in the Northeast head to Fort Lauderdale, Florida for spring break: Carole (Lorna Luft) taking a separate vacation from her steady boyfriend Chip (Howard McGillin), winds up as a hot contender in a "Hot Bod Contest"; Jennie (Lisa Hartman) is doubly lucky, courted by both a rich classical pianist (Daniel McDonald) and a devil-may-care rocker (Russell Todd); Sandra (Wendy Schaal) looking for the Mr. Right who will finally satisfy her; and Laurie (Lynn-Holly Johnson) a sex crazed nymphomaniac dreams of a night of unbridled passion with a real he-man. Laurie ends up getting her wish, albeit through a rather unexpected source. During the week-long festivities, the girls meet Sandras snobbish aunt Barbara Roxbury (Louise Sorel) and her friend Maggie (Alana Stewart) and get to sample much of Fort Lauderdales nightlife. They are also invited to a formal party at Barbaras house, which ends up being crashed by hundreds of spring breakers.
