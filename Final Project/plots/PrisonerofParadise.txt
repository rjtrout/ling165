The documentary is a chronicle of the life and career of Kurt Gerron. During the 1920s and early 1930s, Gerron was a well-known cabaret and film actor in Berlin. He sang the song "Mack the Knife" in the initial production of Brechts The Threepenny Opera and appeared in a supporting role in Josef von Sternbergs classic German sound film The Blue Angel, co-starring Marlene Dietrich. When the Nazis came to power, Gerron remained in Germany, in spite of serious warnings by von Sternberg and Peter Lorre that he should leave the country. Later, Gerron moved to Paris and Amsterdam in order to continue his entertainment career. He was captured by the Nazis in 1943 and sent with other Jews to the Theresienstadt concentration camp located near Prague. In 1944, the Nazis promoted this as a model settlement where the Jews were being well-treated and allowed a visit from the International Red Cross, to placate the Danish government. That year the Nazis recruited Gerron to write and direct a 23-minute propaganda film, The FÃ¼hrer Gives a City to the Jews. It presented the concentration camp as a "wonderful" place. Despite his cooperation, Gerron and his wife were subsequently included in the liquidation of the ghetto and deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, where they were both murdered.
