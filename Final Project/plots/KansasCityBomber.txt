The film is an inside look at the world of Roller Games, then a popular league sport-entertainment, a more theatrical version of Roller Derby. The story focuses on K.C. Carr who has just left her former team in Kansas City, Missouri to start her life as a single mother over again in Portland, Oregon with a team called the Portland Loggers. Loggers owner Burt Henry is clearly interested in her, and K.C. and Burt date. But Burt has a rather ruthless side to him: he trades away K.C.s best friend on the team, and when he sees that star male skater "Horrible" Hank Hopkins is interested in her, he manipulates the audience into booing Hopkins, causing him to go crazy and lose his job. Henrys endgame is to set up a match race between K.C. and her teammate and rival Jackie Burdette, with K.C. deliberately losing so that she can join Henry at a new team hes setting up in Chicago. But K.C. doesnt trust Henry anymore (or his promises to let her bring her daughter along) and wins the match race.
