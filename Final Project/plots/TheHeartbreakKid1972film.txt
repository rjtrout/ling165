The story begins in New York City with the traditional Jewish marriage of emotionally shallow, self-absorbed, "nebbish"-man-boy Lenny Cantrow (Charles Grodin), a sporting goods salesman, to Lila (Jeannie Berlin, daughter of director Elaine May), an annoyingly unsophisticated and emotionally needy girl. While on their honeymoon in Miami Beach, Lenny meets and pursues the beautiful but manipulative Kelly Corcoran (Cybill Shepherd), a Midwestern college girl on holiday with her parents. When Lila is severely sunburned, Lenny quarantines her to their hotel room as he engages in a series of rendezvous with Kelly, lying to Lila about his whereabouts. Lenny impulsively ends their ephemeral marriage to pursue an indifferent Kelly, his ideal woman and ultimate fantasy shiksa-goddess. He believes she is the girl he has been waiting for all of his life and just "timed it wrong." After leaving Lila (after only five days of marriage), he follows Kelly to Minnesota, where her justifiably resentful and protective father (Eddie Albert) is a relentless obstacle. Mr. Corcoran has undisguised contempt of Lenny, even offering a $25,000 bribe for Lenny to leave following a dinner where Lenny inanely praises Midwestern produce as having "no deceit in the cauliflower." Lenny eventually marries Kelly, whose chief intent appears to be to rile and defy her father. At the wedding reception, Lennys attempts at mingling with mindless conversation fails, and he is ignored by the guests, his bride, and the new in-laws. He is a stranger at his own feast, quoting the cliches of the Republican press to some unimpressed children and lapsing into the same useless hum with which Lila formerly drove him mad. He got the girl, but appears to have lost a feeling of belonging.
