Dr. Gray Thompson, (Randolph Scott) an American missionary doctor, works alongside Dr. Sara Durand (Ruth Warrick) in a hospital he has built in a small hilltop Chinese village, while Japanese forces descend on China. When Gray returns from a trip, he shocks Sara (who is in love with him) by introducing his new socialite wife, Louise (Ellen Drew). Bored and feeling out of place, Louise tries to persuade him to give up his dangerous cause. In the midst of aerial bombing attacks on the village, Dr. Thompson unselfishly helps the local residents, and especially the insurgent leader Chen-Ta (Anthony Quinn) who loves nurse Siu-Mei (Carol Thurston), betrothed to Dr. Kim (Philip Ahn), a sympathetic Chinese/Korean doctor. Col. Yasuda (Richard Loo), a high-ranking, injured Japanese prisoner, manipulates Dr. Kim into sending a (coded) message, purportedly from Louise, to his side that the village is secretly harboring an ammunition dump. Gray and the others become puzzled when Japanese airplanes stop attacking their village,. When Japanese paratroops descend on the village, Gray organizes the defense and sends a messenger to Chen Ta. During the brutal fighting, Yasuda fatally shoots Dr. Kim and grazes Gray. A distraught Louise runs out into the line of fire and is killed. The Japanese are defeated when Chen Ta and his men arrive on horseback. He promises to return for Siu Mei after the invaders have been driven out of their country. As the air raids begin again, the two doctors stoically face the next air raid together.
