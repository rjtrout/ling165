Governor Grisby is politically ambitious, as is ruthless right-hand man Blake and a man on their payroll, Chercourt, an influential lobbyist. There is a problem, though: Grisby is actually a wanted murderer named John Williams. Fearing that the fingerprints for Williams on file with the FBI will someday be traced back to the governor, Blake coaxes petty crook Paul Craig into having his sister, Natalie, a clerk for the FBI, steal the Williams file. She now knows too much, so Blake arranges for Natalie to be killed in a car crash. FBI agents Stedman and Donley begin to investigate. Natalies roommate is Shirley Wayne, another clerk for the FBI. Shirley tells them that when Natalie was visited by brother Paul at lunch, both looked extremely nervous. Shirleys fianc√©e happens to be Chercourt. She is asked to go undercover, carrying a walkie-talkie, as Blake and Chercourt are still trying to get their hands on the right file so that the fingerprints can be destroyed. Grisby surrenders when the feds arrive. Blake tries to flee on a speedboat, but is shot down.
