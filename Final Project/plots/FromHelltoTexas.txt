Tod Lohman is on the run from a posse. The ruthless land baron Hunter Boyd has sent men, including sons Otis and Tom, in pursuit of Tod for having killed another son. With the intention of riding in behind the herd and shooting Tod, Otis Boyd stampedes horses. Tods gunshots drive the animals back and in the opposite direction, causing Otis to be trampled. Later, Tod gets the drop on Tom Boyd, who has been trailing him. Tod insists he did not kill Toms brother, Shorty, and explains what did happen. Tod tells Tom to relay the truth to his family and sends him on his way. While trying one more time to kill Tod, Tom shoots the mans horse instead. On foot, Tod collapses near a river bank. He is found by kindly rancher Amos Bradley and daughter Juanita, who provide food and shelter. Juanita takes a liking to Tod, who is searching for his missing father; he was raised by his mother, who instilled in him Biblical principles and lessons. Tod departs but is soon surrounded by Hunter Boyd and his men. In gratitude for not shooting Tom when he had the chance, Hunter Boyd permits Tod a horse and a four-hour head start, then resumes the chase. Tod discovers that his father has died. He visits Amos Bradleys ranch where he and Nita fall in love. He knows he must keep running, but hopes to return permanently. Hunter Boyd, Tom and a member of the posse confront Bradley and wound the old man when he will not let them search his home for Tod. This proves the last straw for Tod, who aborts his plan to flee and takes on the Boyds in town. During the gunfight, as ordered by his father, Tom shoots a chandelier in an attempt to douse the lighting. Tom is engulfed by the resulting flames. Tods instincts take over and he saves Toms life. An appreciative Hunter Boyd calls off the vendetta.
