Set in May 1929, the film focuses on two sisters - Mayme (Clara Bow) and Janie (Jean Arthur) - as they share an apartment in New York City. In daytime, they work as salesgirls at the Ginsbergs department store, and at night they vie for the attention of their colleague Bill (James Hall) and fight over Janies selfish and reckless behavior, such as stealing Maymes clothes and hitchhiking to work with strangers. Bill prefers Mayme over Janie and constantly shows his affection for her. This upsets Janie, who schemes to break up the couple. One day at work, Bill is promoted to floorwalker, while Janie is made treasurer of the benefit pageant. Mayme, however, is not granted a promotion, but gets heavily criticized for constantly being late at work by the head of personnel, Miss Streeter (Edna May Oliver).
