At a zoo, a cage was reserved for Taz. He soon escapes and runs amok. Meanwhile, Daffy is at home in his duck pond, and reads about Tazs escape in a newspaper. Taz soon finds him and gives chase after the black mallard. While fleeing from Tazs hungry jaws, Daffy hears a news bulletin posting a $5,000 reward for the Tasmanian Devils return which also says Taz becomes docile when exposed to music. After failing with a radio (the extension cord doesnt go too far), a trombone (Daffy loses the slide) and bagpipes (apparently the only music Taz doesnt like), Daffy eventually resorts to using his own voice to calm the devil. Eventually, after serenading him for ten miles, Daffy leads Taz to his cage, slamming the door on the beast just as he finishes his song-and his voice gives out. After Taz grabs some of the Ducks reward money which slipped on the ground, Daffy rushes inside the cage screaming his famous line "its mine, mine all mine", and beats Taz up, and reassures the audience that he may be a craven little coward, but heâ€™s a "greeeedy craven little coward."
