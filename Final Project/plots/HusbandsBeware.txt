Moe and Larry marry Shemps overweight sisters (Lou Leonard and Maxine Gates), and discover to their horror after the vows that the girls are a couple of battle axes. After being kicked out from their place, the new bridegrooms vow revenge on Shemp for introducing them. Later, Shemp has a voice lesson with student, Fanny Dinkelmeyer since he is a music teacher. He then discovers that he has to marry a woman within seven hours to receive $500,000 from his dead Uncles will. After some searching, the Stooges finally find Shemps student, Ms. Dinkelmeyer. Several of Shemps old ex-girlfriends all arrive at the Justice of the Peaces office, wreaking havoc in an attempt to marry Shemp for his money. But Shemp weds the harridan, just under the deadline, and then discovers that his Uncle is not dead, there is no $500,000 will, and that everything was Moe and Larrys revenge because Shemp let Moe and Larry marry his two overweight sisters and got divorced. Shemp gets so angry, he takes out a gun and shoots Moe and Larry in the rear end as they try to flee.
