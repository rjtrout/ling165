10 MPH follows the progress of Caldwell as he rides a Segway scooter across the United States from Seattle to Boston, stopping at many places along the way to interact with people. The film focuses on showing the dynamic nature of the US countryside as well as documenting the stories of people Caldwell and Weeks encounter along the way. 10 MPH shows Caldwell, Weeks, and other members of the crew but also provides footage of the people they meet, both helpful and rude. For example, Caldwell and the crew are stopped by an Illinois police officer who admonishes them for traveling at 10 miles per hour (16 km/h) on a road with a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) speed limit. The filmmakers also document their struggles, from the technical challenges of maintaining the Segways batteries to the production challenge of losing a producer part way through the filming process.
