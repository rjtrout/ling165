He meets sheriff Nat Bell and district attorney Buck Streeter and asks why Bannermans arrogant son, Tom, got away with killing a man without an arrest or trial. Offered no assistance, Thorne stands up to Tom and then jails him. He becomes acquainted with Bannermans beautiful niece, Amy Lee, who is attracted to Thorne but doubts her cousin Tom is a cold-blooded killer. Thorne finds allies in Caroline and Vince Webb, who own a gun shop and are willing to testify with evidence against Tom in court. Thorne realizes he needs to sneak Tom and the Webbs to a different town if hes to get a fair trial. Bannerman and his men pursue them, and Amy Lee watches as Tom deliberately causes Vince Webbs death. In time, Thorne gets the prisoner to the next town safely, and Amy Lee goes to court to back him up.
