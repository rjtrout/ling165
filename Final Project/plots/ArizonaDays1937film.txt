Tex and his sidekick "Grass" Hopper are delighted to join a travelling music show. When a group of cowboys come in without paying, Tex steps down from the stage, pulls his six gun and holds the audience up until the manager points out the men who did not pay their admission fee. After seeing the way Tex gathers revenue from cheats, the County commissioner offers Tex a job as a tax collector.
