She is active on social networks and has over 800 friends on Facebook. She lives with three friends, Olivia (Brit Morgan), Isabel (Brooke Markham) and Gustavo (Sean Marquette). She is also close friends with Kobe (Connor Paolo) and is dating Tyler (William Moseley). Laura receives a friend request from a student at her campus, Marina Mills. Seeing her talents in animation, she accepts the request and begins a friendship with the lonely girl. However she soon notices that Marinas Facebook profile is plastered in bizarre and disturbing images and her obsessive behavior begins to make Laura feel uncomfortable. When Laura shares pictures of herself at her birthday dinner – to which Marina was not invited – Marina publicly and angrily confronts her at her college campus. During the quarrel, Laura accidentally pushes Marina and her hat falls off, revealing her bald spot, a result of trichotillomania, causing Marina to run away. Laura notices Marinas several comments, who tries to apologize to her, Laura eventually unfriends Marina on Facebook. Seeing her number of friends once again down to zero, a heartbroken Marina angrily closes her laptop. That night, Laura notices a black mirror, which shows a forest where a dark figure is seen walking. As Laura is staring at it, a terrifying demonic face appears behind her, but quickly disappears when Olivia turns on the light. In the next morning, teacher reveals that Marina has committed suicide, much to Lauras astonishment. Another night, Marina uploads a video, showing she burns the drawing of Laura and commits suicide by hanging herself, terrifying Laura. The next morning, Laura receives a message from Marina containing the video of her suicide. Later on, it is posted to her Facebook page. Laura is unable to remove the video, and her friend count drops. Left with no choice, she tries to delete her account, but an unknown error occurs. Realizing that she is being stalked, Laura goes to Kobes apartment for help. When Kobe and Laura investigate Marinas Facebook page, they realize that the source code where it has been written is not the normal code. That night, Marina adds Gustavo as a friend and posts a distorted picture of his face. The lights suddenly cut off, he is then terrorized by a spirit, while seeing things that were posted on Marinas page. Gustavo rushes into the elevator for safety, only to be attacked by a swarm of wasps; he is discovered banging himself dead later by Isabelle, who was sent to a hospital and begins to blame Laura for Gustavos death. The recorded video of the elevator attack is posted on Lauras Facebook page. Her friends subsequently turn against her by posting angry and disgusted comments, effectively making her an outcast. Laura attempts to text her friends that she didnt, but to her confusion, the texts suddenly change as "u will know what it felts to be lonely :)". Laura goes to the orphanage where she meets the woman, who reveals that Marinas real last name is Nedifar; Marina was ruthlessly bullied and tormented by the boys when she was seven-year old. However, they were murdered by an unknown assailant. Meanwhile, Kobe is looking for the black mirror on a website. Suddenly, the several faces of Marina appear on monitors as the lights begin flickering, but everything quickly revert when the janitor arrives. A devastated Isabelle notices the mutilated body of Gustavo and rushes to find someone for help, but finds that nobody is there. Horrified after seeing the two men with their mutilated faces coming toward her, she rushes into the bathroom locks herself. To make matter worse, she finds the body of herself before being killed by the wasps. Laura goes with Detective Cameron and his officer to watch the recorded footage of Isabelle which showing that everyone were here, revealing that shes been hallucinating and slits her own throat out of madness, controlled by Marina. The footage was later posted on Lauras Facebook page. Tyler, Kobe and Olivia are unable to delete the videos, unfriend Laura or deactivate their account as unknown errors keep occurring, Lauras Facebook friend count continues to drop, while Tyler is looking the address of Marinas home. Olivia separated with Laura and moved out, fearing that she would share the same fate as Gustavo and Isabelle. Later, Laura notices the picture of Olivia from Marinas page, the picture slowly melts, implying that she is next. Laura attempts to call her, but Olivia has turned off her phone, alongside laptop. Olivia is attacked by Marina with wasps and taken into the hospital. When Tyler and Detective Cameron talking, Marina possesses Olivia through the heart monitor and lunges at the police officer, taking the gun from him. Instead of shooting the officer, she shoots herself in the head, killing Olivia. Meanwhile, Laura hunts down the place where Marina committed suicide in order to destroy the black mirror that turned Marina into an evil spirit, she and Kobe go to Marinas house which was burnt down and attempt to look for her. While there, Kobe sees an ethereal entity come out of the basement and approaches him, but disappears when Laura bumps into him. Laura tells him that Marina is not there, but he suggests that they look in the basement. Marina is not found in the basement, but while searching, Kobe is separated from Laura, who finds him staring into a black mirror. When she turns him around and asks whats wrong, he apologizes to Laura and says that she cant be lonely if she died. Kobe suddenly stabs her in the stomach, hoping to kill her in order to save himself and Tyler. Laura hits him with her flashlight and escapes from the basement as Kobe gives the chase but loses her. Laura then realizes through one of Marinas posts that Marina committed suicide in one of the nearby factories. Meanwhile, Tyler finds a deranged Kobe looking for Laura. After getting a call, Tyler and Kobe head to the factories as well, but he tells Kobe to stay in the car while finding Laura. Once getting to the factories, a wounded Laura starts looking for Marinas body, she receives a video call from her mother, Caroline, who informs that shes been seeing Marina too. Lauras video call begins to glitch out as her mother begins to act strangely, a sign that she may be attacked by Marina. Caroline takes a knife from the table and goes to the other room, presumably killing herself as the connection times out. Devastated by her mothers presumed death, Laura begins to cry after seeing everyone shes loved being taken away. Tyler soon finds her, only their reunion is cut short when Kobe appears and stabs Tyler in the throat, killing him. Laura attempts to escape Kobe once again but reaches a dead end. However, before he can kill Laura, Kobe is violently attacked and killed by the pack of wasps. Laura, feeling dazed, sees an apparition of a two men (presumably the boys, who bullied Marina in the orphanage). Laura yells at Marina, asking what she wants from her, the spirit of younger Marina appears and says that she wanted to be best friends with her as she leads Laura to Marinas rotten corpse and her laptop which transports Laura into one of Marinas earlier posts. Laura is then lunged at by a demonic Marina. Some time has passed and there is a fresh batch of students. Laura is seen looking at some girls in the same way that Marina saw Laura and her friends. Laura then faces her laptop (presumably Marinas laptop) and is shown to have zero friends, just like Marina before she met Laura. Then her new account  – which shares the same dark, grotesque images and renamed as Lau Ra –  is revealed. The camera shows Lauras eyes are green and blue, implying that Marina has possessed Laura.
