Confederate veteran Matt Weaver (George Segal) returns home to New Mexico after the Civil War and discovers his farm was sold by a banker named Brewster (Pat Hingle). His fiancee Ruth (Janice Rule) has married another man in his absence. Ruths husband and other Union sympathizers in town resent Weavers allegiance to the Rebels during the war. His town turns against him, and soon Brewster hires a creole of color gunman named Jules Gaspard dEstaing (Yul Brynner) (who pronounces his name in french) to come to town and provoke Weaver into a fatal fight. However, the gunfighter becomes a malevolent and sinister force and so the town leaders are forced to turn to the Rebel whom they once wanted dead, to save them from the killer they hired.
