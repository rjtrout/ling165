Elmer has come to the country to photograph wildlife. As he tries to photograph Happy Rabbit, Happy finds himself a convenient victim to harass. This tormenting eventually drives Elmer insane, causing him to jump into a lake and nearly drown. Happy saves him, ensures that Elmer is perfectly all right - and promptly kicks him straight back into the lake. Then, Happy throws Elmers "How To Photograph Wildlife" book on his head, thus ending the cartoon as the screen irises-out.
