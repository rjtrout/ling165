Although deeply in love with young Mary (Mildred Harris), he eventually spurns Marys affection for the more outgoing and worldly young Ruth (Colleen Moore). Eventually, Jimmies father Mr. Bates (Richard Henry Cummings), in a fit of exasperation with the boys antics, beats him severely and Jimmie runs away from home. While on the lam Jimmie becomes involved with a criminal gang of thieves and Jimmie serves a sentence in jail. After completing his sentence, Jimmie vows to turn over a new leaf.
