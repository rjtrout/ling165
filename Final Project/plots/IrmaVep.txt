Cheung is employed to play the film-within-the-films heroine, Irma Vep (an anagram for vampire), a burglar, who spends most of the film dressed in a tight, black, latex rubber catsuit, defending her directors odd choices to hostile crew members and journalists. As the film progresses, the plot mirrors the disorientation felt by the films director. Cheung the character is in many ways seen by other characters as an exotic sex object dressed in a latex catsuit; both the director and Cheungs costume designer Zoe (Nathalie Richard) have crushes on her. The film makes reference to iconic figures in French film history: Louis Feuillade, Musidora, Arletty, François Truffaut, the Groupe SLON, Alain Delon, and Catherine Deneuve. Thematically, the film questions the place of French cinema today. It is not a “mourning for cinema with the romantic nostalgia” but “more like the Mexican Day of the Dead: remembrance as an act of celebration,” so that “It is less a film about re-presenting the past, than it is a film about addressing the present, specifically the place of France within the global economy.”
