Sean Vetter (Vin Diesel) and Demetrius Hicks (Larenz Tate), who are former criminals, are members of the U.S. DEA working on the California/Mexico border. After arresting a drug baron named Memo Lucero (Geno Silva), the mysterious "Diablo" starts to take over Memos drug pipeline and territory, and to send a warning message to the DEA, organizes the assassination of Vetter. The assassination is botched and Vetter survives, but his wife, Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors), is killed in the crossfire. Looking for revenge, Vetter acts outside the law to punish his wifes murderers. To accomplish that, he asks Memo, who is now in prison, for help finding Diablo. After Memos wife and son are also assassinated by Diablo he agrees to help Vetter. With Hicks help, Vetter hunts every member of the cartel from the bottom to the top of the organizations hierarchy and finds that Memo is linked to the recent activities. Vetter gets help from Lucero to find Diablo and later finds out that he killed Luceros right hand man, who was posing as Diablo. Sometime later, Vetter confronts Lucero in Mexico, and Lucero tells him that his arrogance got Stacy killed, just like him coming to "kill" Lucero. Vetter pulls out the handcuffs and repeats to Lucero what Lucero said to him, "If I wanted you dead. You would be.", Tons of undercover DEA Agents pop out of nowhere and take Lucero back into custody. Were left with the impression that Luceri is Diablo and he ordered the hit of his own family and Sean (to escape prison).
