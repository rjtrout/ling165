Four men, Bob Sangster, "Barbwire" Gibbons, "Wild Bill" Kearney, and José, rob the bank in the town of New Jerusalem. José and the cashier is killed, while Barbwire is shot in the shoulder. The three outlaws escape the posse, fleeing into the desert. However, their horses die and they have little water. When they reach a water hole, they are dismayed to find that not only is it dry, but there is a pregnant woman stranded there. She gives birth to a boy. Before she dies from her ordeal, she makes the three the childs godfathers and begs them to take him to his father, Frank Edwards ... the cashier they murdered. Bob wants to abandon the boy, but the other two are determined to honor the womans request. They start walking the 40 miles to New Jerusalem. Weakened by his wound, Barbwire eventually can go no further. He makes the others continue on without him, then shoots himself. That night, they stop to rest. When Bob wakes up the next morning, he finds Bill gone. A note explains he left to conserve the little remaining water. Bob goes on, discarding his belongings along the way, including finally the loot. At one point, he leaves the baby, but then picks him up again. His strength gives out just as he reaches a poisoned water hole. Then, he comes up with a plan. He drinks his fill, knowing that he will have about an hour before it kills him. He stumbles into New Jerusalems church, where the congregation is celebrating Christmas. Then, his task completed, he dies without uttering a word.
