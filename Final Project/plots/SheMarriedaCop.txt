A couple of cops, Jimmy Duffy and partner Joe, answer a call after a neighbor complains about the noise from an apartment where Hollywood studio animators Linda Fay and Bob Adams are auditioning actors for a cartoon pig. After buying tickets to a policemens ball and promising to keep the noise down, Linda overhears Jimmy singing a few notes and has an inspiration, hiring him. She neglects to tell him what for, however, and Jimmy believes he will be seen singing in a movie. They fall in love and marry, but Jimmy is humiliated at the films premiere, with all his family and friends there, when his voice comes from "Paddy," the cartoon pig. It leads to a separation, but Jimmy has a change of heart when he finds out that Linda is expecting a baby, which will also be used in the story of Paddys next cartoon.
