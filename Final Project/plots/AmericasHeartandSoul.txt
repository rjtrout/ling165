Americas Heart and Soul is a documentary which shows the different cultures and lifestyles that exist in America; from a family in New Orleans to the West to the peak of the Colorado Mountains. Louis Schwartzberg packed up his camera and hit the road, with a goal of capturing both the unparalleled beauty of the U.S. and the incomparable spirit of its people. Unobtrusively, the filmmaker delves into the lives of ordinary Americans, who just so happen to have extraordinary stories, seamlessly blending their values, dreams, and passions into a spirited and well-paced film.
