Lewis Dodd (Charles Boyer) is a composer whose latest symphony flops in London. Seeking new inspiration, and to escape his critics, he travels to Switzerland to stay at the home of older friend Albert Sanger (Montagu Love). Sangers four young daughters—Kate (Jean Muir), Toni (Brenda Marshall), Tessa (Joan Fontaine) and Paula (Joyce Reynolds)—have been raised in relative isolation, and swiftly develop crushes on Lewis. The elderly Sanger dies, and per his instructions, Lewis sends to England for Charles Creighton (Charles Coburn), Sangers wealthy friend (and the uncle of Tessa and Paula), and his daughter, Florence (Alexis Smith). Lewis is inspired by the girls to write some of the first heart-felt music hes composed in years. Kate leaves for school, Toni marries, and Lewis falls in love with Florence. Lewis then quickly asks Florence to marry him, breaking the heart of Tessa, who has been secretly in love with him for a long time. Tessa and Paula are sent to boarding school, while Lewis and Florence marry and move to London, but ambitious Florence angers Lewis by trying to push his career too hard. Tessa (who has a heart condition) and Paula run away from school to the Dodd house. Lewis is inspired by Tessa to write beautiful music again, and Florence realizes Lewis is falling for the teenage girl. Florence bitterly confronts Tessa. Lewis inspired symphony is performed to great acclaim, and during the performance Lewis rushes home and asks Tessa to marry him. Tessa refuses, as hes already married. Returning to the theater, Florence tells Lewis she will divorce him, as it is clear that Tessa is not only his great muse but also his true love. Lewis rushes home to tell Tessa, but finds her dead—the conflict with Florence having been too much for her.
