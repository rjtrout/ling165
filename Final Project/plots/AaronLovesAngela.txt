This modern adaptation of William Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet deals with the struggles of living in Harlem and interracial divides in the 1970s. Two teenagers living in the slums of New York City are deeply in love with each other. Angela (Irene Cara) is Puerto Rican girl who lives in the Spanish Harlem with her mother. She falls in love with Aaron (Kevin Hooks), a young black basketball player. Their interracial relationship is not approved by either of their parents, and they soon find out that the same prejudice is shared by their friends and neighbors. They rebel by meeting in secret, yet soon find themselves in danger.
