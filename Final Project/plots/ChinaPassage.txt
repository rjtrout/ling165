Tom Baldwin and Joe Dugan are two American adventurers who are hired to escort the wife of a Chinese general to Shanghai. She is carrying a priceless diamond. Upon their arrival at the destination, there is a firefight, during which the diamond is stolen. The two Americans round up a group of suspects, but have no luck uncovering the stolen jewel. Among the suspects are Jane Dunn and Katherine Collins, an author named Anthony Durand, and Harvey Dinwiddle. They release the suspects, and then make plans to travel to San Francisco. When they board the ship, they are surprised to find that all of the suspects are also aboard the same ship. As they resume their search for the diamond, Baldwin and Dugan discover that Jane is a US customs agent, who is also searching for the jewel. As the search goes on, Baldwin and Jane fall in love. After their room is tossed, Dugan is killed. Katherine is an insurance investigator, who has uncovered some information, but she is killed before she can pass that information on to Jane and Baldwin. Baldwin is framed for Katherines murder, but Jane solves the diamonds theft and the murders, revealing that Durand and his henchman, Dinwiddle, are the perpetrators. Baldwin and Jane are married by the ships captain.
