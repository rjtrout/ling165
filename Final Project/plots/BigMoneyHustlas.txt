Sugar Bear (Shaggy 2 Dope), a streetwise detective from San Francisco, is brought to New York City by its chief of police (John G. Brennan) to take down Big Baby Sweets (Violent J), a notorious crime lord who controls the entirety of the citys criminal underworld with his right-hand men Big Stank (Jamie Madrox) and Lil Poot (Monoxide Child), and his personal security ninja Hack Benjamin (Robert Bruce). After getting a firsthand look at the police forces incompetence via Officer Harry Cox (Harland Williams), Sugar Bear prevents a robbery of a local doughnut shop by one of Big Baby Sweets thugs, Ape Boy, and begins a romance with a 300-pound stripper, Missy (Sindee Williams). He soon arrests Big Baby Sweets, Big Stank and Lil Poot himself, but the police are forced to let them go because of a lack of evidence. The gangsters retaliate by terrorizing the city and sending a pair of stealthy Magic Ninjas to murder Missy, leading Sugar Bear to depressed alcoholism. Sugar Bears idol, Dolemite (Rudy Ray Moore), appears before him to reassure him and begin training him to bring down Sweets evil empire. Sugar Bear kills the Magic Ninjas and Hack Benjamin, and has Big Stank and Lil Poot carted off by their wealthy, upper-class parents before defeating another one of Big Baby Sweets henchmen, Cactus Sac (Mick Foley), in a wrestling match. During Big Baby Sweets personal confrontation with Sugar Bear, Sweets is shot by his mother, and Sugar Bear removes Sweets face paint, revealing him to be Harry Cox.
