James Dunn (Wayans), a United States Marine who served in the Gulf War, is wrongly accused of an assassination of an officer he had disputed with. Dunn is later saved from death row and recruited for a top-secret special operations squad led by Lt. Col. Grant Casey (Voight). Their mission is to neutralize criminals who had avoided conventional law enforcement methods. On his first mission, Dunn finds that his purpose is to actually be falsely perceived as the man who assassinated the first lady. Soon, a search begins for Dunn and Dr. Victoria Constantini (Hennessy) who happened to videotape what occurred. One of the forces looking for him is the military, led by General Adam Woodward, which is in fact the real name for Grant Casey.
