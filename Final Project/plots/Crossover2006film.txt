Noah Cruise is a naturally talented basketball player who receives an athletic scholarship to UCLA. His mother has died and he has moved from a 7 Mile neighborhood in north Detroit to the prestigious Palmer Woods neighborhood to live with his grandmother. Although he is a skilled player, Cruise wishes to use his scholarship to become a medical doctor. He has to deal with external forces that come with his talent, most notably pushy sports agent and bookie Vaughn and his best friend Tech, another basketball prodigy who still lives in the old neighborhood. Tech also hangs with high-schooler Up, a neighborhood baller who helps him hustle other schoolyard basketball players. Vaughn pressures Cruise to pursue a career in professional sports, while Tech dreams of beating his rival Jewelz (whose team is undefeated for three years) in an underground streetball competition run by Vaughn. Tech is also struggling to obtain his GED after missing his final year in high school due to an assault charge he accepted that rightfully belonged to Cruise. Cruise and Tech meet two local women along the way, Vanessa and Eboni, and the four of them travel to Los Angeles on Cruise’s UCLA-orientation trip. Cruise has fallen deeply in love with Vanessa, proposing marriage when she lies and tells him she is pregnant with his child. She then lies to a newspaper reporter and states that Cruise played streetball for money – which quickly costs him his scholarship – because she wants him to be a highly paid NBA player rather than get an education. She dumps him when he refuses to give up his education, after which a motorcycle accident damages a lung and ends his ball playing anyway. Vanessa’s lies are revealed, Tech wins $20,000 beating Jewelz at Vaughn’s streetball event (with Up playing on Tech’s team), Cruise eventually earns a medical degree and Tech eventually completes his own education and signs with a EuroLeague basketball team.
