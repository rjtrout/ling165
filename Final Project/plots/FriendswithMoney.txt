Olivia (Jennifer Aniston) is a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in Los Angeles in order to make ends meet. She is surrounded by a support network of well-off friends consisting of Franny (Joan Cusack) – a stay at home mom with a large trust fund; Christine (Catherine Keener) – a successful television writer; Jane (Frances McDormand) – a fashion designer; and their respective husbands. While the disparity in financial situations between Olivia and her friends creates some friction, each woman is facing her own individual struggles. Olivia cant seem to find love or money and resorts to questionable tactics to satisfy both. Frannys inheritance sometimes causes tension between her and her accountant husband, who likes to spend it. Christines marriage is falling apart because she and her husband cant communicate effectively. Finally, Jane is becoming increasingly unpleasant to be around, possibly because of her discomfort with her age and her husbands sexual ambiguity. Together, these women attend charity benefits, have lunch, lean on each other, and wade their way through life.
