Communist conspiracies seem to be everywhere in the 1950s, particularly in Washington, D.C., where word has reached John Rogers, the Secretary of the Navy, that one of his subordinates is strongly suspected to be a Communist sympathizer. Bernie Goldsmith has no idea that he is the man in question as he enjoys his daughters school essay on patriotism. The news that he is being suspended from work and investigated comes as a complete shock to him. Friends and neighbors, including a Protestant minister and a Catholic neighbor, rally to Bernies side after others begin to shun him. Joe DiMarco agrees to represent him in court, where a female lieutenant, Mary Jane McCoy, paints a suspicious picture of Bernie in the Navys eyes. Others recant their original testimony against Bernie. Some witnesses discredit themselves when they issue antisemitic tirades about Jewish control of industry or a Jewish-Communist conspiracy. Joes diligent work results in conclusive testimony that Bernie is not a Communist and all charges against him are dismissed. A grateful Bernie can not wait to be reinstated at work. Secretary Rogers, however, has stubbornly decided that he still cannot trust him. Months go by, with Bernie unable to find gainful employment. Those who believe in Bernie go to great lengths again to get the Secretary to apologize and restore the innocent mans good name.
