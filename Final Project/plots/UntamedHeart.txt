Caroline (Tomei) is a young woman in the Minneapolis/St Paul area working as a waitress and attending beauty school part-time who is always unlucky in love. Adam (Slater) is a loner/shy busboy who saves Caroline when two men try to rape her on her way home one night. She then gets to know him. They become close, but she finds out his past, and the attackers come after Adam for revenge. They end up stabbing him. While Adam is recovering in the hospital, Caroline discovers that he has a heart defect, though he claims he has a baboon heart, based on a story loving nuns told him at the orphanage where he grew up. On his birthday she surprises him by taking him to a hockey game. Before they leave, he shows her a surprise gift he left her to be opened when they return. At the hockey game, Adam catches a stray hockey puck that is shot into the crowd. On the way home, he falls asleep and dies at the age of 27. After the funeral, Caroline opens the gift he left her. It is a box of albums with a handwritten note from Adam declaring his love for Caroline.
