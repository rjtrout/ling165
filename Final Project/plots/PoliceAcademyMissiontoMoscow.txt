Russian mafia boss Konstantine Konali (Ron Perlman) is laundering money under the guise of a legitimate business. The business is a highly addictive video game that allows him to bring down almost any security system controlled by a computer on which the game has been played, with a string of major robberies as the result. Desperate to apprehend Konali, Russian Commandant Alexandrei Nikolaivich Rakov (Christopher Lee) sends for help from America. Rakov decides to bring in someone he met at a police convention, Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes). Lassard briefs his team about the mission in Russia, then they head to Moscow. Along with Lassard in Moscow are Sergeant Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Sergeant Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Captain Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Cadet Kyle Connors (Charlie Schlatter), and Captain Thaddeus Harris (G. W. Bailey). As they plan to capture Konali, he has devised a new scheme: create an even more addictive version of the game, which can bring down any computer security system in the world, including the systems that protect the databases which belong to world powers.
