Daniel returns to his familys mansion for the holidays along with his girlfriend Susanne. His familys seemingly utopian existence is overshadowed by not only the death of Daniels brother, but also by Daniels failure to live up to his brothers potential. However, this quickly becomes inconsequential, as blood-thirsty killers soon show up to steal the artwork, and whatever else they can find in the house. As the family members are killed, Daniel flees with Susanne in the basement, hoping for survival. Daniel reveals not only knows the blood-thirsty killers and is in on the whole thing, but was also responsible for the death of his brother. Daniel kills all the "art thieves" and starts to stage the scene when one of his siblings "rises from the dead" to foil his plan. He is caught in the act of trying to strangle him by Susanne and what ensues is a battle not only for her life, but the life of his last-surviving family member.
