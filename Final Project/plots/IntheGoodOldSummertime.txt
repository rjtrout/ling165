Veronica Fisher (Judy Garland) enters Oberkugens music shop, looking for work. Although Otto Oberkugen (S. Z. Sakall) is reluctant to take on more staff, she wins a job by persuading a wealthy matron, through her singing and musical expertise, to buy a harp at almost $25 over Oberkugens list price. Neither she nor Andrew Larkin (Van Johnson), the shops senior salesman, suspects that they are each others anonymous pen pal. They bicker constantly at work although becoming increasingly attracted to each other.
