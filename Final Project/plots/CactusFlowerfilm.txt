21-year-old Toni Simmons attempts to commit suicide by inhaling gas from a second-hand stove. Her neighbor, Igor Sullivan, smells the gas and rescues her by using mouth to mouth resuscitation, which evolves into a kiss after Toni regains consciousness. Tonis failed suicide attempt stems from her despondency following being stood up by her lover, Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau). Julian Winston, a dentist, had told Toni from the beginning of their relationship that he had a wife and three children. Unknown to Toni, Julian is not married; and Toni hates lying above all other transgressions. Upon learning of Tonis suicide attempt, Julian decides to marry Toni, but he needs a wife to divorce in order to sustain his earlier lie. Julian asks Stephanie Dickinson, his longtime nurse (Ingrid Bergman), to pose as his wife. At first unwilling, she ultimately relents, since she has long had a crush on her employer. Toni senses Miss Dickinsons feelings for Julian and asks Julian to help Miss Dickinson find another man. Ultimately, Julians friend Harvey, his patient Señor Arturo Sánchez, and Igor all become embroiled in Julians scheme. Toni suspects Julians untrustworthiness and leaves him for Igor. Julian finally falls in love with Miss Dickinson. The prickly cactus Miss Dickinson keeps on her desk in the office gives the film its name. Like Miss Dickinson, the cactus thrives in the driest of settings—and Miss Dickenson gets the driest, funniest lines. Ultimately, both the cactus and Miss Dickinson "bloom."
