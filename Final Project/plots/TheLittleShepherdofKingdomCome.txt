Chad (Jimmie Rodgers) is a confused young man growing up in 1860s Kentucky. Sheltered from his brutal guardian by a friendly schoolmaster, he learns to love the tiny village of Kingdom Come and has no inclination of leaving. But when the American Civil War breaks out, he finds himself at odds with most of his friends by joining the Union Army. His wartime experiences force Chad to grow up in a hurry, and he returns to Kingdom Come with a whole new outlook on his future existence.
