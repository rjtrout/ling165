Young doctor, Jim Stanton (John Beal) has two passionate interests in conflict with each other. He is first a conscientious surgeon, but in his spare time, pursues his love of flying, a dangerous hobby that his well-intentioned father abhors. His father is a well-regarded doctor who does his best to curtail his sons flying. When Jim flies a married woman on a flight that ends in disaster with his passenger killed, the resulting scandal prompts the hospital to put Jim on probation. Believing that he is innocent and wronged, Jim becomes a hobo and is arrested for vagrancy and put to work on a road crew in Los Angeles. When he runs into an old pal, Dick Miller (Philip Huston), he is persuaded to take a job as a mechanic for Roberts Aviation. On an emergency flight that turns out to be less than routine, nurse Doris King (Joan Fontaine) becomes suspicious of the new employee who not only can handle the controls of an aircraft, but also knows what to do in a medical emergency. Doris finds out the truth about Jim from an inquisitive newspaper reporter, "Nosey" Watson (Jimmy Conlin). Although trying to maintain his anonymity, Jim accepts a position as a pilot and finally at the scene of a train crash, his secret life is fully revealed on board the special "aerial ambulance" aircraft, when Doris and Jim are able to assist Jims father in saving the lives of crash victims.
