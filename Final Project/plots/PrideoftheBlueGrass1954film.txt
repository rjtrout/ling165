Jim Nolan owns a stable of thoroughbred racehorses and employs Pop Wilson, a long-ago trainer, as a groom. Pop has a son, Danny, whose ambition is to become a jockey. One day, Linda Mason brings her horse Gypsy Prince to the Nolan stable and ends up boarding him there, although Jim is convinced that the horse does not have the making of a champion. Linda takes a job as a waitress at the track restaurant to pay for her horses keep. Pop and Danny put long hours into training and riding Gypsy Prince, but just as he is about to win his first race, a bandage on the horses leg comes loose and it stumbles before the finish line. Danny is injured and a doctor intends to euthanize the horse, but Linda talks him out of it. After going to work for wealthy stable owner Helen Hunter, who also has a romantic interest in him, Jim at first alienates Linda, then is pleased to see that she and the Wilsons have nursed Gypsy Prince back to health. All are happily reunited after Lindas horse wins the next race.
