The East Side Kids are ejected from their clubhouse in a raid brought on by complaining neighbors, they have no place to train for an upcoming boxing tournament. The police commissioner is worried that his son Gilbert, who prefers ballet to boxing, is turning out to be a wimp, so he offers the gang a deal: hell lay off them if they will take his son in their gang and toughen the boy up. Gang member Muggs McGinnis takes an instant dislike to Gilbert, and sets Gilbert up to get in a fight with Danny More, the gangs best boxer, but is impressed when he sees Gilbert use ballet moves to avoid getting hit, and instead knock out Danny. Later, the East Side Kids learn that Gilberts girlfriend Rita has taken Gilbert to an illegal casino owned by local gangsters. The East Side Kids get to the casino just before cops raid the place. Muggs is able to sneak Gilbert out, but Danny is injured, and Muggs himself is caught, and is therefore barred from entering the boxing tournament. Gilbert agrees to participate in the tournament, and is in bad shape after the first two rounds. Muggs advises Gilbert to use his ballet moves, which enables Gilbert to win the match. Gilbert then confesses the truth about having been at the casino, and his police commissioner father clears Muggs of all charges.
