Gilin is a gangster who has just gotten out of prison. One night while driving home with his girlfriend Nikki, he collides with defense workers Bill Barry and Mary Dale. Bills tires are destroyed, and when the insurance company is unable to replace them, Nikki convinces him to exchange Bills car for the car of Gilins Chinese servant Tom, who has enlisted in the Army. With government restrictions on rubber in place due to the war, Gilin goes into business stealing and re-selling good tires, then sells tires retreaded with cheap synthetic rubber to used-car lots. One of Gilins retreads blows out and causes the death of Marys brother. Bill and his co-workers become determined to find the culprit behind the shoddy tires. Gilin worries that his scheme will be discovered after Bill traces a tire to his lot. Nikki is pressured by Gilin to accept a date with Bill, but pretends not to be able to reach him, then secretly warns Mary of Gilins intentions. However, Bill goes to see Nikki, intending to ask her about the tire, and falls right into Gilins trap. Gilin knocks Bill out and plans to kill him. Tom comes back from the army on leave, and refuses to help his old boss when he learns that Gilin is a war profiteer. Gilin shoots Tom and escapes with Nikki to his warehouse. Tom manages to stay alive long enough to tell Bill about what has happened. Bill calls his co-workers and the police, and they raid the warehouse en masse. During the fight, Gilin is shot by one of his own men, who is appalled that Gilin would kill Tom, a soldier. Nikki goes to work at an armaments factory.
