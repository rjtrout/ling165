Joe Anton (Raft) is a speakeasy owner who falls in love with socialite Miss Healy (Cummings). He takes lessons in high-class mannerisms from Mrs. Jellyman (Skipworth). Joe does not know that Miss Healy only pays attention to him because he lives in the fancy apartment that her family lost in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Joe decides to instead pursue his old flame Iris Dawn (Gibson) just as Miss Healy begins to genuinely fall in love with him.
