Jimmy Hudson (Cary Grant) is a vagabond American artist in Mexico who cant pay his hotel bill. Louise Fuller (Grace Moore) is an acclaimed classical singer recently expelled from the U.S. to Mexico on an expired visa, and desperate to get back in. She hires Hudson to marry her so that she can regain entry to the United States in time to give a benefit performance, stipulating that he must divorce her within six months to receive his final payment. Hudson agrees only because he sees something special in her, but thinks she has lost her way both personally and artistically in fame, her entourage, and her career. Once they have returned to the country and gone their separate ways, Hudson begins pursuing her, hoping to bridge their differences by drawing her from her own gilded world into his, and thus to turn their sham marriage into something real.
