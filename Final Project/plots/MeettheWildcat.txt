One day in Mexico, magazine photographer Ann Larkin is in a museum when she happens to see a man steal a painting. Pursuing and accusing him, she believes the man, Brod Williams, to be a notorious art thief known only as "The Wildcat." Brod brings the stolen painting to Leon Dumeray, a gallery owner. Dumeray recognizes it as stolen property and notifies the police, who place Brod under arrest. Ann comes to visit Brod in jail, but after complying with his request to bring him a pineapple from a local fruit stand, she is shocked to find a gun has been hidden inside it. Brod makes a daring escape, forcing Ann to switch clothing with him and fleeing the jail dressed as a woman. Law authorities later congratulate Brod on his scheme. He is actually a police detective from New York City who is trying to smoke out Dumeray, who is the real Wildcat. He is offered a job by Dumeray, who now trusts Brod to be a dishonest man. Ann, however, doesnt know Dumeray is the thief and tips him off to Brods true identity. Dumeray takes both as his prisoners, but Brod breaks free and calls for the police.
