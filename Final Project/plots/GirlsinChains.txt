Johnny Moon is a mob boss who controls everything from politicians to a profitable womens penitentiary he runs. He has ruined many lives, including that of Helen Martin, a teacher, and her sister Jean. A political reformer, Frank Donovan, is able to persuade Helen to go undercover behind bars, posing as an inmate, to unearth evidence that will prove Moons abuse of the incarcerated women. She ultimately succeeds, but not before placing her life in grave danger.
