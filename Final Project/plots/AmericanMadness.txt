In the Great Depression era, the Board of Directors of Thomas Dicksons bank want Dickson (Walter Huston) to merge with New York Trust and resign. He refuses. One night, Dicksons bank is robbed of $100,000. The suspect is Matt Brown (Pat OBrien), an ex-convict whom Dickson hired and appointed Chief Teller. Brown, whos very loyal to Dickson, refuses to say where he was that night. He has two witnesses for his alibi, Mrs. Dickson (Kay Johnson) and fellow worker Cyril Cluett (Gavin Gordon), but Brown is protecting Dickson from finding out that Mrs. Dickson was with Cluett having a romantic evening. Cluett, who has a $50,000 gambling debt, is responsible for the robbery, but lets Brown take the rap. Word of the robbery causes a run on the bank, but friends of the banker come to his aid, and the bank is saved.
