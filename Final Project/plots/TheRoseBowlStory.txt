Qualifying to play in the illustrious Rose Bowl football game on New Years Day, a Midwestern colleges quarterback, Steve Davis, isnt as happy as he should be because playing football doesnt excite him, but his teammate Bronc Buttram is thrilled. Their coach, Jim Hadley, is equally pleased because his ill wife has gone to warmer Glendale, California for her health, so he will now be able to spend more time with her. Steve perks up in Pasadena while meeting the Rose Bowls committee and particularly the tournaments queen, Denny Burke, a beauty in a fur coat. Steve believes shes wealthy as well as beautiful and manages to get her telephone number. He cant get through, however, because Dennys younger sister Sally is always tying up the phone. Finding her house, Steve learns shes a middle-class girl whose dad, "Iron Mike" Burke, once played in a Rose Bowl game himself. Denny takes exception to Steves disappointment that shes not rich and to his blas√© attitude toward the Rose Bowl, a tradition her family loves. The self-involved Steve develops a guilty conscience. Agreeing to spend New Years Eve with her family, Steve stands up Denny because hes at the hospital, where Coach Hadleys wife has taken a turn for the worse. He gets busy signals phoning because Sallys hogging it again. Next morning, Bronc explains to Denny and she is relieved. At the game, the coach announces his wifes going to be all right. Steve leads the team to victory, unselfishly letting Bronc score the winning touchdown. He and Denny are in love and plan to marry.
