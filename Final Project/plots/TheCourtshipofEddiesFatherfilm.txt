Young Eddie Corbett (Ron Howard) tries his best to be a matchmaker for his widowed father, Tom (Glenn Ford). At first, sexy Dollye Daly (Stella Stevens) seems promising, but she ends up falling in love with and marrying Toms friend and radio colleague, Norman Jones (Jerry Van Dyke). Tom becomes attracted to a sophisticated socialite, Rita Behrens (Dina Merrill). They begin considering marriage, but Eddie takes an immediate dislike to Rita and she does not know how to deal with Eddie (nor does she particularly want to learn). In the end, Tom chooses his son over her. Through all this, the Corbetts are supported by their new housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston (Roberta Sherwood), and by their divorced next-door neighbor, Elizabeth Marten (Shirley Jones). It takes a crisis for Tom to realize what has been under his nose all the time.
