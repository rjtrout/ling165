Abigail, a young lady from Boston, leaves home to go to New York City for singing lessons in pursuit of her grand ambition to sing for the Metropolitan Opera. Unable to make ends meet, she takes a job singing in a Bowery beer hall without telling anyone from her family back home. When her sister Martha comes to town looking for her, Abigail keeps up the ruse. She even sneaks into a performance as a Met, persuading her family that she really is a singer there, despite causing a mishap that interferes with Olaf Olstrom, the companys top tenor. Martha eventually figures things out. She decides what Abigail needs is a respectable husband and sets out to introduce her to Lawrence, a wealthy young patron of the arts. To her surprise, Lawrence falls for Martha instead, which is fine by Abigail, who simply wants to sing.
