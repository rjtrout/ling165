After inheriting a newspaper from her father, the socialite Joan Langford clashes with the managing editor Hank Gilman. He is a hard-bitten newsman who resents her interference in the running of the paper. Disguising herself as an aspiring young journalist, she gets a job at the paper. Although Gilman is in fact well aware of who she is and assigns her to very difficult assignments to convince her that the newspaper business is not for her. However she eventually gains his respect, and together they thwart an attempt at blackmail by Langfords British butler who is revealed to be the head of a society of criminal servants.
