Judith Moore had what she thought was a perfect marriage, with both she and her husband studying to be doctors. But after she puts her studies on hold to find a job and support them, many years pass until suddenly he leaves Judith to be with another doctor. Depressed, she holes up in her apartment, where the middle-aged Pat Francato serves as a building superintendent and elevator operator. He is as lonely as she is, beset with gambling problems, and Judith and Pat make a connection. Yet what he wishes to pursue as a romantic relationship, Judith sees only as a friendship. Her friend Liz Bailey, who sings at a nightclub, makes attempts to improve Judiths love life as well as her own.
