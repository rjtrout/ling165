Final Approach deals with the mental condition of amnesia when a stealth test pilot, Col. Jason Halsey (James Sikking), is involved in an air disaster. A psychiatrist Dr. Dio Gottlieb (Hector Elizondo) attempts to help Halsey to recover his memory, but his motives seem suspect. Is Gottlieb giving professional help or is he a counter-intelligence agent sent to debrief Halsey?
