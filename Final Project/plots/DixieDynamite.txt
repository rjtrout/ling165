A man who makes liquor illegally from a still is in cahoots with the sheriff, who then double-crosses him. The moonshiner is shot dead by the sheriffs deputy. His two daughters decide to take over the family business, but when the sheriff and a corrupt local banker disrupt their operation and eventually destroy their still, the girls decide to get even.
