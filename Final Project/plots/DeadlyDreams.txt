Orphaned at age 10 when his parents were brutally murdered on Christmas Eve, every night Alex dreams the same dream: cornered by a man in a wolfs mask, a knife is brought to Alexs throat, and then he wakes. But waking moments confirm his worst fears, and soon Alex is trapped in a tangle of suspicions, lies, and fear. Reality fades into terror as he is left alone to fight the relentless force that haunts his Deadly Dreams.
