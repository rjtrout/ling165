The story, about lost art, both literally and figuratively, follows the journey of Carter Frazier, a down on his luck music producer hiding out in the tiny West Texas town of Marfa when a strange man gives him a (famously lost) piece of modern art, then turns up dead later that day. Carter seeks the art after it goes missing, hoping to fund his dream of building a music studio and improve his foundering existence, but hes thwarted by cops, local characters and, ultimately, fate along the way.
