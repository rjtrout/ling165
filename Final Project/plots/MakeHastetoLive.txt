Crystal Benson is a single mother living in a small town in New Mexico. One night she feels a man is stalking her. She grabs a gun and makes a series of arrangements anticipating her own death. She prepares a tape with a message for her teenage daughter, who (in flashback) speaks about her relationship with Steve Blackford, who had a good reason to hate her. Crystal is determined and has many resources to kill him if he tries to hurt her, but Steve has had 18 years to prepare a plan of revenge.
