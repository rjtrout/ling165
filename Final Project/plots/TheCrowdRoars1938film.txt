Tommy McCoy (Robert Taylor) becomes a boxer, not for love of the sport but for the money. He has to put up with his alcoholic, gambling father Brian (Frank Morgan). Just before his first major fight, Tommy learns that his opponent has been injured and has been replaced at the last minute by Tommys good friend, former world champion Johnny (William Gargan), trying to make a comeback. During the bout, Tommy kills Johnny and is named "Killer McCoy" in the newspapers. He then comes under the control of powerful bookmaker Jim Cain (Edward Arnold). While training, Tommy meets and falls in love with Cains daughter Sheila (Maureen OSullivan). Cain has been very careful to keep his daughter from learning about his profession. Cain tries to break up their romance, but without success. Tommy wins fight after fight, becoming a contender. If he wins his next bout, he will get a shot at the world championship title. However, "Pug" Walsh (Nat Pendleton), a traitorous associate of Cains, has both Sheila and Brian kidnapped. He orders Tommy to lose the fight in the eighth round, or else. Tommy has no choice; he endures a merciless pounding for round after round, not even daring to hit his foe for fear a lucky punch could end the match and his loved ones lives. Fortunately, Brian pretends to collapse, then manages to grab a gangsters gun. He sends Sheila to the fight, while he holds their two former captors at gunpoint. However, while he is distracted by the radio broadcast of the fight, one of the men shoots him; he fires back, and all three are killed. Sheila arrives just before the start of the eighth round. Tommy proceeds to knock out his opponent, then announces he is giving up boxing. Cain also retires. Afterward, Tommy and Sheila get married.
