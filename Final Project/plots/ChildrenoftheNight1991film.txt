Before going away to college, two childhood friends, Cindy Thompson and Lucy Barrett (Ami Dolenz), decide to symbolically cleanse themselves of the "dirt" of their small town by swimming laps in an abandoned church crypt. Lucy drops her crucifix, which drifts down onto the submerged remains of an ancient vampire, Czakyr. Czakyr awakes and kills Cindy. Mark Gardner (Peter DeLuise), a school teacher from a nearby town, gets directed to Allburg by an old friend of his, Father Frank Aldin (Evan Mackenzie). Once there he tries to help Lucy, as she has now become the target of a town-turned-vampires, due to her "virgin blood". Lucy, Mark, and a drunken preacher make camp in an abandoned building outside of town and make plans to fight the vampire army. Utilizing the preachers "cross mobile" they battle Allburgs entire vampire populace, ultimately taking on the evil Czakyr. Once Czakyr has been killed, the towns folk return to normal, with some complaining of "splinters in their chests".
