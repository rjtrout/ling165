As described in a film magazine, Jules Leneau (Lewis) and his wife Jane (Maye), living in a cabin in the Northwoods, are inconsolable after the death of their infant son. Through the wicked scheme of Red Adair (Eason) and his partner, trappers who live below the Leneaus, a child from the city is kidnapped and brought to the woods. The child wanders away and falls into a bear trap set by Jules, who discovers him there. The child is adopted by Jules and his wife and, because of her joy, he does not try to discover where the child is from. Red Adair makes several attempts to recover the child, and as a result Jules learns where the child belongs, and resolves to give him up despite Janes pleadings. She is about to cast herself from a cliff when the story is brought to a happy and unexpected ending.
