In an effort to secure employment at the upscale Century City Mall in Los Angeles, Jennifer (Sobieski), a 17-year-old "goth-punk" girl who just graduated from high school, makes a nuisance of herself at a clothing store run by 49-year-old Randall Harris (Brooks), who eventually hires her on a trial basis as a stockroom clerk. Jennifer refers to herself simply as "J", and thus asks Randall if its okay if she calls him "R", to which he accedes. One day, as there is nothing more to be done in the stockroom, J makes her way to the front of the store and begins to interact with customers. Encouraged by her initiative but concerned that her appearance may frighten away potential customers, Randall buys her an appropriate outfit and promotes her to saleswoman. Feeling isolated from the other people in her life, J finds she is attracted to Randall. After an incident that makes him question whether he can continue to trust her, J demonstrates her trust in him by revealing that she engages in self harm. The two thus strike up an unlikely friendship as they realize that neither has anyone close with whom they can confide. Made aware that J is unhappy living with her mother (who seems to pay more attention to her two pugs than her daughter) and stepfather, Randall offers her an advance on her salary so she can afford her own place, then helps her find an apartment. As their friendship progresses, Randall consents to getting a (very small) tattoo at Js urging, only to realize at the last possible moment that he cant go through with it. In a fit of despair he declares that they cant continue as friends. Confronted by J at his home a short time later, Randall confides his many phobias, which endears him to J even more. Their friendship restored, Randall reluctantly accompanies J to a cemetery to lie on the graves of the deceased to feel their "energy", something she does regularly. Due to the lateness of the hour, they go back to Randalls where they bond over tea and J spends the night on the couch. The following morning J discovers Randall collapsed in the street after having told her he was going "for a run." She learns that Randall has had leukemia for many years and doesnt have long to live, and is initially very angry that he didnt share this with her. While collecting some of Randalls personal items from his home, J discovers the name and address of his ex-wife. Unable to contact her by phone, J drives to Albuquerque only to find her (and Randalls) son Randy, a deeply cynical young man who tells her that his mother died in a car accident six months earlier, and had told him that his father had died before he was born. Although he initially refuses to drive to L.A. to see the father hes never known before he dies, he ultimately does so. Because of Js intervention, Randall and his son have a brief time to get to know one another, for which Randall is very grateful. Js friendship with Randall inspires her to seek a closer relationship with her family, especially her mother. In Randalls final days, Jennifer organizes a dinner at which his son and Jennifers family come together to celebrate his life.
