Celia Evarts and her brother John inherit the valuable Hatchet Ranch after their father dies in a blizzard. Other cattlemen and cowboys in the region immediately try to take advantage, grazing on the land and using its water for free. Celias brother is also shot and killed. Will Ballard, her foreman, sets out to protect Celias interests, with sheriff Joe Kneens help, particularly after Celias fiance, Sam Danfelser, betrays her and sides with Bide Marriner, a rich rancher who hopes to gain control of Hatchet for himself. Bide seizes a watering hole and the only way Will can think of to defeat him is to destroy it. Bide then tries to shoot the sheriff in the back, but Kneen gets the better of him. Sam rides in for one more confrontation, but before he and Will can come face to face, Celia slips away and takes care of matters herself.
