"Albert the Great" heads up a family juggling act on the vaudeville circuit. Albert Norwick loves the life, entertaining with wife Fay, son Bert and daughters May and June, but vaudeville is a dying form of entertainment and everyone in the family is forced to find normal, everyday jobs. Although agent Toby Helper continues to look for stage bookings, Albert has become a New Jersey companys shipping clerk. May elopes with boyfriend Frank Doty, reducing the act by one should it ever reunite. June is seeing Arthur Waldron, Jr., whose father owns the firm where she works. Bert, meantime, has a good job and is more interested in playing baseball than in returning to show business. August Dinkel offers a 16-week booking out west, out of the blue. Albert desperately wants to go, so much so that he goes to the train station alone when everyone else in the family declines. But when he hears a crowds roar from a nearby baseball field, Albert goes to watch Bert play and realizes he and the entire family are here to stay.
