Chuck Arnold (Dan Dailey) is a bandleader during the 1920s. He meets hometown girl Peggy Mayhew (Jeanne Crain), a flapper script girl, at one of the bands presentations, and the next day, they get married. Though she loves him, life on the road becomes increasingly difficult for her, and eventually, with the rise of the Great Depression, in 1929, she tires of it, and returns to her country home. Unable to find new bookings, he soon joins her, and brings with him Oscar Hoffman (Oscar Levant) his acerbic, cynical manager. The bandleader finds the pastoral life a crashing bore, and so, he heads for the big city to find fortune. Fortunately, this time, he succeeds, and happiness is the result.
