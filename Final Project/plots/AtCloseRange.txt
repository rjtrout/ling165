One night, his estranged oldest son, Brad Jr., contacts him after a fight with his mothers boyfriend and stays with him at his home in Homeville, Pennsylvania. Eventually, he becomes involved with his fathers criminal activities, and starts a gang with his half-brother, Tommy. The boys attempt a daring heist, which results in their arrest. All of them are bailed out except Brad Jr. During Brad Jr.s time in jail, another member of the gang receives a grand jury subpoena. Brad Sr. believes that they will inform on him, so he rapes Brads girlfriend, Terry, as a warning. Brad Sr. feels his only recourse is to eliminate every witness that can connect him with his sons and their gang. He kills Tommy himself and orders a hit against Brad Jr., who is seriously wounded, Terry is also killed. Brad Jr. threatens his father with a gun, intending to kill him, but decides that he wants Brad Sr. to "die every day for the rest of his life," and instead testifies against him in court. His father is sentenced to life in prison.
