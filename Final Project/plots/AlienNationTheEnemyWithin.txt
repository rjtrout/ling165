In this movie, detective Matthew Sikes and his Tenctonese partner George Francisco investigate a group of Tenctonese called the Eenos. The sub-plot involves Tenctonese binnaum Albert Einstein and his new bride May attempting to have a child (with Georges help) -- a reversal of the Alien Nation episode Three to Tango.
