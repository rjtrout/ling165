Set in Victorian London, the story concerns a music hall chorus girl, Belle Adair, aka Rose Lynton, who blackmails a gentleman, Michael Drego, after seeing him leave the house where another dancer, Daisy Arrow, was found murdered. Instead of accepting money she demands to be invited to the mans stately home to experience the life of a lady. The woman becomes friends with the mans mother, Lady Margaret Drego, his fianc√©e, Audrey Ashton, but her peace is disturbed when the police inspector, Deputy Inspector Evans, arrives to question them further about the murder. Then another murder is committed in similar circumstances.
