The film has a non-linear construction with frequent flash-backs and flash-forwards. It is the Summer of Love. The title character (Christie) is a young San Francisco socialite married to a savagely abusive architect (Chamberlain). At a benefit concert for victims of traffic accidents, she meets Dr. Archie Bollen (Scott), with whom she became smitten as he treated an injured Mexican boy. Archie is in the process of divorcing his wife (Knight), sifting through relationships with the new man in his exs life, his estranged sons, and well-to-do friends who only know Archie as one-half of a couple. Petulia and Archie embark on a quirky, desperate, and ultimately tragic affair.
