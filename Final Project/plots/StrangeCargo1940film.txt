Julie (Crawford), a cafe entertainer in a town near the Devilâ€™s Island (French Guiana) penal colony, meets Verne (Gable), a prisoner on wharf duty. Verne escapes and goes to Julies room, but is apprehended after Mssr. Pig (Peter Lorre) reports him, and he is returned to prison. Julie is fired for consorting with a prisoner. At the prison, Moll (Albert Dekker) has masterminded a jailbreak and takes Cambreau (Ian Hunter), Telez (Eduardo Ciannelli), Hessler (Paul Lukas), Flaubert (J. Edward Bromberg), and Dufond (John Arledge) with him. Verne joins the escapees, taking Julie with him. The gentle Cambreau (a Christ figure) exerts a spiritual influence over the others, often reading from and quoting the Bible. As they trek through the jungle, most die with only Verne, Julie, Hessler, and Cambreau surviving the ordeal (Hessler--a Judas figure--disdains Cambreaus salvation and is last seen slinking off into the night, knowing as a gale arises that there is no turning back). Verne initially scoffs at Cambreaus spirituality, but saves him from drowning (as Cambreau clings to driftwood---again, as a Christ figure on Calvarys cross) and penitently decides to return to the prison to finish his sentence. Julie has grown to love Verne and promises to wait for him.
