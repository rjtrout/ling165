Set in 1960, the story follows the efforts of the Mossad, the Israeli Secret Service, to find former SS Colonel Adolf Eichmann, who ran from Germany to Argentina and took the name Ricardo Klement. He was wanted for the murders of both Europeans and Jews during the Holocaust. Learning of Eichmanns living in Argentina, the Mossad sends a team to capture him, led by agent Peter Malkin. The standing order: bring Eichmann back alive to Israel for trial. The film ends with the take-off of the El Al aircraft taking Eichmann to face trial in Jerusalem. In real life, this aircraft was a turboprop-powered Bristol Britannia. However, the Britannia aircraft had a very short operational life, due to passenger demand for jets, and none were available for the movie. A Boeing 707-320B was therefore used instead, even though that particular marque of 707 did not fly until 1962.
