Although she has no teaching experience, widow Jan Stewart is hired by headmaster Dr. Barrett to be the first woman to teach at The Oaks boarding school. Jan gets to know her twelve students and fellow faculty member Joe Hargrave, who is dating the rich Barbara Dunning. She has so much sympathy for one young boy, Bobby Lennox, whose globe-trotting parents neglect him, that she reads letters pretending they are from his mother that Jan wrote herself. A wealthy Texan widower, Richard Oliver, enrolls his son. Richard Jr. instantly alienates the other boys with his attitude and by refusing to confess to causing a fire alarm to go off, for which Dr. Barrett punishes the entire class. The boys father wants him sent home and Jan is asked to accompany him on the journey. She wins young Richards trust and gains Richard Sr.s interest as well. He ends up proposing, but Jan and Joe ultimately realize they were meant for one another.
