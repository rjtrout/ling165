Ware College is a small Black college in Ware, Ohio. Once prominent, it is now low in attendance, low in enrollment, and low on money. At a meeting with instructors Drury and Annabelle Brown, Dean Hargreaves reveals that CEO Benjamin Ware III, grandson of the colleges founder, claims the estate of his late grandfather is now also destitute, which they believe is untrue and a result of Annabelles having spurned his affections. They decide to appeal to their famous alumni for financial help through a reunion, and invitations are sent. Many could help; but surely not Lucius Jordan, a timid lad who loved Annabelle too but dropped out under pressure from Ware. What they dont know is, hes now Louis Jordan, king of swing and leader of the Tympani Band. By accident, Jordan and his bands train is sidelined in Ware for repairs and when he learns of the colleges plight, he agrees to pitch in. Though the stuffy faculty are unaware of his reputation, the kids are, and class attendance soars.
