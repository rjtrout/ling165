Wealthy aristocrat Marguerita Novarro and her maid are rescued by Phillip Kent when their carriage breaks loose. It is 1840 and California is ruled by the Mexican government. Kent is transporting rifles from Mexico City to California to be used by soldiers there. The women hide and ride with Kents caravan to Santa Barbara. Although she is wealthy and can pay, Kent says he will forego any remuneration from Marguerita in exchange for the first dance at a festival. As love blossoms, they continue north to Monterey with the caravan, where Kent is reunited with an old friend, Lt. Carlos Ortega, only to learn that Ortega is engaged to be married to Marguerita. An attack by Spanish royalists leaves Ortega seriously injured. Manuel De Roja is taken prisoner by Kent and turned over to one of Ortegas men, but the officer in charge turns out to be Manuels own brother, Major De Roja. Now in love, Marguerita and Kent try to leave Monterey together but are captured by De Rojas men. A jealous Ortega searches and is also taken captive, but after an escape, Kent kills De Roja in a battle with swords. Mexicos soldiers rout the royalists, and a grateful Ortega gives his blessings to Marguerita and Kent.
