The story of six affairs of the heart, drawn from controversial feminist author Mary MacLanes 1910 syndicated article(s) by the same name, later published in book form in 1917. None of MacLanes affairs - with "the bank clerk," "the prize-fighter," "the husband of another," and so on - last, and in each of them MacLane emerges dominant. Re-enactments of the love affairs are interspersed with MacLane addressing the camera (while smoking), and talking contemplatively with her maid on the meaning and prospects of love.
