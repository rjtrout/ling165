On the same day, the plant where she and her friend Sheryl (Sofia Vergara) work closes so she loses her job which adds to her existing financial difficulties. As they discuss how they will get by, Brenda is approached by Miss Mildred, the woman who watches Brendas youngest child in her home daycare center. Miss Mildred is upset that Brenda has not been paying for daycare and states that she will no longer watch Tosha. Later, they all go to Mike Jrs school basketball game where he is a star. A scout, Harry (Rick Fox), takes notice of Mike Jr and comes to his house to speak to him about his future and ends up asking Brenda out. Brenda has no interest in hearing about the possibility of going pro and walks away. She takes her daughter to Miss Mildred and begs for her to watch the girl so she can go get money from her ex and pay the woman back. Miss Mildred relents and Brenda and Sheryl go to the construction site where Mike Sr. works. It is revelaed that Brenda has never received any assistance from her ex and he again refuses to provide any financial support. Brenda decides to take her children to Georgia to attend her fathers funeral. She is met by his other children who were unaware of her existence. As she gets to know her newfound relatives, she is surprised to run into Harry but learns that he lives in the same town and is on good terms with her fathers family. At dinner, it is revealed that the eldest son of "Pop" Brown, LB, was the only one who knew about Brenda. On his deathbed, their father confessed to LB that he had been a pimp in Chicago and that Brendas mother, his mother, and a number of other friends of their fathers that they had known were all his working girls. The family now recognize Brenda as one of their own and offer their support and encouragement. Brenda and her children return to Chicago. Mike Sr. has considered Brendas words and attempts to take an interest in his sons life but is still not willing to provide much assistance. Mike Jr rejects him and leaves. In an attempt to make money to help his mothers situation, he turns to his friend Calvin who is a drug dealer. Harry sees Mike Jr selling drugs and counsels him. While Harry and Brenda go on a date, Mike Jr tells his friend that he no longer wants to take part in illegal activities and he is shot. This leads to a further breakdown in the relationship between Brenda and her ex. Harry reaches out to the Browns to ask for help in getting her fathers old place for her and her kids. They renovate the home and surprise Brenda. Despite this gesture, Brendas insecurities and family gossip lead to her having doubts about Harrys motives and they split up. A league representative comes to visit Brenda and Mike Jr and offers him a million dollar contract. She finds out that it was Harry who referred Mike Jr to the league. On signing day, Mike Sr. shows up to be photographed with his ex and son but Mike Jr announces to the press that he doesnt know his father and that his mother had raised him without support. Upon leaving, he tells his mother that Harry is a good man and more of a father figure than his actual father had been. Brenda goes to see Harry and they reconcile, ultimately leading to marriage.
