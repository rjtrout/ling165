After being bullied, book-smart (but not street-wise) teenager Cal Chetley (Devon Graye), joins his Oklahoma high schools wrestling team, seeing it also as a way to reunite with his estranged and wayward brother, Mike (John Cena). His mother, Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), is not initially supportive of Cals decision, especially when she discovers that Mike is secretly coaching Cal after she gets a call from Mike Chetleys jail cell. She has been away and without contact of her older son, Mike, for over 10 years, but copes and watches yet another family male become legendary.
