Rosemary Clintons parents are displeased by her interest in a boy, Tommy Price, who, although a doctors son, has a reputation as a juvenile delinquent. Making a bet with his friends that Rosemary will grant him her favors, Tommy chases her under a pier and is arrested by police. His disappointed parents must bail Tommy out of jail, while the Clintons forbid their daughter from seeing the boy again. Rosemary and Tommy date without their parents knowing it. She appeals to his better nature, persuading Tommy to go to college and perhaps become a doctor like his dad. But after a bully called Rock picks a fight with him, Tommy ends up bloodied. Then he and Rosemary are caught together by her father, who slaps her. Rosemary runs away, but Tommy convinces her that no one can keep them apart.
