Zack (Chris Salvatore) and his new boyfriend Benji (Aaron Milo) are setting off to vacation at an all-male resort in Palm Springs, California, with their friend Lily (Harmony Santana). In light of the veritable smorgasbord of available men that are sure to be awaiting their arrival, Benji has proposed that he and Zack open up their relationship, just for the weekend. He is not ready to limit himself sexually and explains that this will be a good way for them to explore together. Zack is less than thrilled with the idea, but hes eager to keep Benji happy and, after all, he likes sex too. At the same time, Zacks ex, Casey (Daniel Skelton), is making his way to the same resort with his hag-in-training, Penny (Lilach Mendelovich). Knowing that Zack will be there with his new boyfriend, Casey immediately goes into panic mode, recruiting his new friend, Peter (Michael Vara), to be his pretend boyfriend for the weekend, proving to Zack that he has had no trouble moving on from their relationship. However, it is not long before all plans go awry, and Benji starts making eyes at Peter, while Zack realizes he might not be as over Casey as hed thought. With the gay boys otherwise engaged, Lily and Penny are soon locked in combat for the attention of Luis, the resorts sexy bartender, who also happens to be the sole straight man in sight.
