Billed as an intimate all-access look at life on the road for the global music phenomenon, This Is Us follows the lives of the five members of the boy band, One Direction. One Direction was first put into a group on the X Factor in 2010. This Is Us contains live concert footage from One Directions Take Me Home Tour at Londons O2 Arena, and footage from their lives pre- and post-X Factor appearance, and gives insight into the preparation for their concerts and ultimately what it is like to be One Direction.
