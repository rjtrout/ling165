Ad man Vincent Doane is assigned to land Margot Frasers perfume account. Anxious that his wife Paula might become jealous, he fibs that the account is with a "Mr. Fraser." Paula gets suspicious and decides to play a trick on her husband, hiring an actor to pretend to be a gigolo who is interested in her. Little does she know that Vincent has been tipped off to the ruse. Business tycoon Claude Kimball is mistaken for the gigolo and gets snared in the Doanes schemes, including when the fellow playing the gigolo turns up. Vincent is shocked when Claude arranges for a multi-million-dollar tobacco account to come his way. Paula, however, demands a divorce during the confusion, convinced that Margot has been having an affair with her husband. A confrontation involving all at a train station results in Paula being slapped by Margot, then finally figuring out that her husband has been faithful to her all along.
