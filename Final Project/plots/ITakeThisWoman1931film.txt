Kay Dowling (Carole Lombard), the spoiled daughter of wealthy New York parents, is sent by her father (Charles Trowbridge) to his ranch in Ursula, Wyoming, fearing she will be named a co-respondent in a divorce case. Before she leaves, Kays suitor, Herbert Forrest (Lester Vail), proposes marriage, but she chooses the ranch in Wyoming over a honeymoon cruise. Later, while spending her days on the ranch with her good-humored aunt Bessie, Kay falls reluctantly in love with one of her fathers cowhands, Tom McNair (Gary Cooper), and impulsively marries him. When her father learns of the union, he disowns her. Kay and Tom are forced to live in a one-room shack while Tom tries to expand his cattle herd. One year later, Kay is unhappy with life on the ranch, and longs for the comforts of her familys palatial mansion. One day she receives a telegram from home, and tells Tom that her father is sick and that she must be with him. Back in New York, Kay writes a letter to Tom, asking for a divorce. Soon after, Tom arrives at the estate and explains that he left the ranch to become a professional bronco rider in a rodeo. Kay assumes that he never received the letter, and Tom never mentions it. One night during a party, Tom overhears the guests making fun of him and he tells Kay she can have her divorce. Later, as she realizes that life with Herbert would amount to a life of playing golf, Kay visits Tom at the rodeo. During his performance, he is thrown from a bronco and hurt. Kay rushes to Toms side, and the two reconcile and decide to return to the ranch.
