The film traces the operational history of the USS Franklin before focusing on her final mission in 1945. After repair and refitting at Naval Air Station Alameda, California, after an earlier Kamikaze attack, she set out to sea and combat in the South China Sea near Honshu. On March 19, 1945, a single Yokosuka D4Y "Judy" dive bomber or Aichi D3A "Val" bombed the carrier. Some of the most harrowing footage in the film shows the aftermath of the Japanese bombing, when ammunition dumps aboard the carrier caught fire and began to explode. The Saga of the Franklin ends as a badly damaged USS Franklin, against all odds, reaches the Brooklyn Navy Yard, at New York City for repairs.
