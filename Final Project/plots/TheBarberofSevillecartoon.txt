Woody arrives at "Tony Figaros" barber shop in hopes of getting a "victory haircut" (a then-contemporary World War II reference). Finding the shops proprietor out for an Army physical, Woody attempts to cut his own hair and those of other customers. The first customer that comes in is a Native American who asks for a quick shampoo, and Woody then makes a mess shampooing the mans head, which then causes the mans headdress to shrink into a badminton birdie. The angry Indian then threatens to scalp Woody for "giving him the bird", but Woody quickly knocks the customer out cold with a mallet and sends him out the door, where he ends up standing perfectly still in front of a tobacco shop. Shortly afterwards, Woodys second and primary customer is a burly Italian construction worker who asks for "the whole works". Once Woody blow-torches the mans construction helmet off his head, he proceeds to lather his clients face, chin, mouth, and shoes while singing Rossinis Largo al factotum. Woody then produces a sharp razor and begins shaving the man. Woody elevates the barbers chair to the ceiling while singing an aria, allowing the man to fall to the ground and destroy the chair. Woody then begins liberally swinging the razor at his frightened client, who runs to escape him. A chase throughout the barbershop ensues as Woody doubles the tempo of his singing, until the woodpecker corners the man in the barbers chair and proceeds to give him a shave and haircut at manic speed. The construction worker is dusted off and sent out the door on his way, but the angry client enacts a quick bit of revenge. The man picks Woody up and slings him through a glass window and back inside the shop, where the woodpecker lands and is bopped by shaving mugs falling from a broken shelf. As a last touch, the barbers pole falls on Woody, whose head is seen caught inside the pole.
