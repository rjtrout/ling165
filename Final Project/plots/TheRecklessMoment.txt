While her husband is away on business, Lucia confronts Darby, a slimy Los Angeles criminal, to get him to stop seeing her 17 year old daughter Bea. Darby agrees but only if Lucia pays him money. Lucia refuses to pay and tells Bea of the meeting. Bea is upset and when she later meets Darby they become involved in a struggle during which Darby is accidentally injured and dies as a result. Lucia later finds Darby lying dead by a jetty near her house and hides the body in a swamp, where it is found by the police. Another LA criminal, handsome and smooth-talking Donnelly, then starts blackmailing Lucia over letters Bea had written to Darby. As she tries to get together the 5,000 dollars he demands, he starts falling in love with her and allows her more time. His brutal partner Nagel steps in, calling at Lucias house to demand the money on the spot. Donnelly arrives and attacks Nagel; in the ensuing fight Donnelly strangles Nagel to death but is wounded. Donnelly drives Nagels body away with Lucia in pursuit, but overturns the car. As he lies dying, he gives Beas letters to Lucia and tells her the matter is closed.
