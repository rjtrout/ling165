She is a singer in a nightclub, but Jerry Clinton has been rejecting other jobs and other suitors because of her romantic feelings toward Jack North, who does a comic act inside a horses costume with his partner, Eddie Hampton. Jack inherits a dude ranch out west. When he, Jerry and Eddie arrive, they are pleased to find it a beautiful place, unaware that they have mistakenly gone to the wrong ranch. Jack acts as boss, implementing many peculiar ideas and attracting flirtation from gold digger Gaye Livingston, until real owner Harvey Phillips turns up. Jacks actual ranch is a rundown mess. Jerry and others persuade him that it can be improved into a prosperous place just like the other, and before long Jacks ranch is attracting tourists, also drawn by Ozzie Nelson and his Orchestra being booked to entertain there. Harvey resents the competition and intends to call in an overdue loan immediately, but Jack enters a rodeo, wins first prize in the bucking bronco competition and pays off the debt.
