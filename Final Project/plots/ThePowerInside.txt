Neil, a seemingly normal 20-something, is stuck in a dead-end job and going nowhere in life. Everything changes when a race of planet-destroying moustache aliens needs something inside Neil to help them destroy Earth. Audience members participate by auditioning to join the aliens or the Guardians â€” a group of highly skilled straight razor-wielding barbers. The story unfolds online, with added content and character interactions on Facebook happening in between episodes.
