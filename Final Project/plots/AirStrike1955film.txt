U.S. Navy Commander Stanley Blair (Richard Denning), is in charge of a fighter-bomber squadron during the Korean War based on the U.S.S. Essex aircraft carrier. While training in the Atlantic Ocean, Blairs second-in-command, Lieutenant Dick Huggins (Don Haggerty) demands Ensign James Delaney (William Courtney) be transferred because he has exhibited a "lone wolf" attitude and an aggressive flying style. Blair intercedes explaining to the younger man that team work in the squadron is important. Huggins also is facing family pressure as his wife, Marg (Gloria Jean) is pressuring him to take a shore assignment. Other men in the squadron are also facing difficult decisions: Lieutenant Anthony Perini states that he is only serving his term and then will return to law school, while Lieutenant Hal Alexander (Stanley Clements) wonders if he "has the stuff" to become a career Navy man like his father, who received the Navy Cross during World War II. Lieutenant Smith (William Hudson) reveals that Blair also received the Navy Cross in the war, during a fight near the Mariana Islands, where he bombed an enemy cruiser. While on maneuvers, after Huggins disputes Delaneys claim that he has spotted an unidentified submarine, the conflict between the two results in Blair offering Huggins a transfer out of the squadron. On a training flight, when the squadron runs into dense fog, each pilot has to try to reach the carrier before running out of fuel. With his instruments out and fuel running low, Huggins gets lost. Delaney runs out of fuel and crash-lands, but is rescued. When he finds that Huggins is still in the air, he volunteers to lead Huggins to safety. When both are safely back on the aircraft carrier, they reconcile and the squadron is praised for coming out of a difficult situation with skill and bravery.
