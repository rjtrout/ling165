The story is narrated by Sunny von B端low, who is in a coma after falling into diabetic shock after a Christmas party. Her husband, the dissolute European aristocrat Claus von B端low, is charged with attempting to murder the hypoglycemic Sunny by giving her an overdose of insulin. Claus strained relationship with his wife and his cold and haughty personal demeanor lead most people to conclude that he is guilty. In need of an innovative defense, Claus turns to law professor Alan Dershowitz. Dershowitz is initially convinced of Claus guilt, but takes the case because von B端low agrees to fund Dershowitz defense of two poor black teenagers accused of capital murder. Employing his law students as workers, Dershowitz proceeds to defend Claus, wrestling with his clients unnerving personal style and questions of von B端lows guilt or innocence.
