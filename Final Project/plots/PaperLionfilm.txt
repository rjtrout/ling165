George Plimpton, a writer for Sports Illustrated, has been indulging in a variety of Walter Mitty-like whims and stunts, trying his hand at being a professional athlete (such as briefly pitching in an exhibition game against All-Star baseball players or boxing a round with Sugar Ray Robinson), then writing about the experience. During a game of touch football, his editor gets an idea that Plimpton should try going to a professional football teams training camp as a player. A number of teams say no, but the Detroit Lions agree. Plimpton attempts at first to disguise the fact that hes a total amateur, but soon Lions players can see the truth for themselves. He is unwelcome to some who resent the intrusion, but a star player, Alex Karras, intervenes on his behalf. In practice, Plimpton demonstrates his ineptitude and gets knocked around. But hes a good sport about it and never complains, which most of his new teammates seem to appreciate. At one point George scores a touchdown in practice and is pleased with himself, until catching the other Lions laughing because they had deliberately let him score. With a relatively meaningless pre-season exhibition game scheduled against the St. Louis Cardinals, the Lions head coach, Joe Schmidt, decides to let George play quarterback for one series of downs. The players do their best but so do the opponentsâ€”George is sacked for losses, does very little right and even runs into a goal post, knocking himself cold. Film from the September 8, 1967 preseason game between the Lions and Cardinals is used. But at least he gets a good story out of it, which he goes back to New York City to write.
