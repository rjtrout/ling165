Returning to his hometown of Carvel after several years absence, Andrew "Andy" Hardy (Mickey Rooney), now a high-flying West Coast lawyer, reminiscences about his past (with flashbacks to his earlier filmed exploits alongside Judy Garland and Esther Williams, et al.) and reconnects with his mother, aunt, sister (returning co-stars Fay Holden, Sara Haden, and Cecilia Parker, respectively), and nephew Jimmy (Johnny Weissmuller, Jr.) as he attempts to convince the skeptical townsfolk to let his company build a factory there. When his plan to buy land from his old friend Beezy (now played by Rooneys TV co-star Joey Forman) runs into difficulty, Andy brings his wife, Jane, (Patricia Breslin) and two children, Andy Jr. (played by Rooneys real-life son Teddy) and Cricket, to bolster his resolve, and to help him live up to the lessons instilled in him by his late father. While all seems lost, the closing moments reposition the resurrected series for a new set of Andy Hardy movies, but these never materialized.
