After a witness is shot and a suspect hanged in a jail cell, Police Chief Sprague decides to send Sgt. Joe Geary undercover, looking for a mysterious crime-syndicate boss responsible for ordering these murders. A story is planted by the chief that Geary is being suspended from the force, in order to help him infiltrate the mob. Geary discovers that a police captain is the criminal mastermind. Sprague is killed, though, and Geary framed when nobody believes his story about being undercover. While jailed, his fianc√©e Alice Devlin works to clear his name. Geary breaks out of jail and personally goes to the reform-minded governor to prove his innocence.
