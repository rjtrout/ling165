"Through the power of IMAX 3D, Hubble 3D will enable movie-goers to journey through distant galaxies to explore the grandeur and mysteries of our celestial surroundings, and accompany space-walking astronauts as they attempt the most difficult and important tasks in NASAâ€™s history. The film offers an inspiring and unique look into the Hubble Space Telescopes (HSTs) legacy and highlight its profound impact on the way we view the universe and ourselves. Hubble 3D is an IMAX and Warner Bros. Pictures production, in cooperation with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The film reunites the Space Station 3D film making team, led by producer/director Toni Myers. Hubble 3D blasted off exclusively to IMAX and IMAX 3D theaters on March 19, 2010." The films itinerary takes the viewer past Saturns aurora, the Helix Nebula in the constellation of Aquarius, the "Pillars of Creation" in the Eagle Nebula, the Andromeda galaxy, and the beautiful Butterfly Nebula. The HST has provided data and imagery so detailed that scientists and film technicians have been able to put viewers "inside" the images during two extended CGI fly-throughs. In the most awesome sequence, gaseous clouds billow while million-mile-an-hour stellar winds blow through a cloud canyon in the Orion Nebula some 90 trillion miles across. These data-driven animations were created by the Office of Public Outreach at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Advanced Visualization Laboratory at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
