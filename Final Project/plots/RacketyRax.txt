Always looking for an angle, "Knucks" McGloin purchases the mortgage on Canarsie College and then turns its football teams fortunes around by hiring thugs and hooligans as players and nightclub dancers as cheerleaders. For the biggest game of the season, almost everything goes wrong. Canarsies quarterback double-crosses his teammates and coach Brick Gilligan (a former Sing Sing inmate) by revealing the teams plays to the opponents. Guns are drawn on both sides, a bomb is tossed into the middle of a huddle and explosions destroy the cars belonging to both of the teams owners as soon as the game ends.
