Around the same time Jim Fry learns that his place of work is merging with another company, his wife of nine years Ginny reveals she might be pregnant with their first child. Jim celebrates with friend Steve Hayward, but when invitations are extended to a company luncheon to meet the new executives, Jim is excluded. The word goes around quickly that new president Eli Cave is planning a few changes. Jim feels upset and betrayed after 15 years of loyalty to the firm. Ginny is pleased about the baby, but after Steves wife, her friend Syd, speaks happily of the upcoming luncheon and improved prospects for their husbands, Jim confesses to Ginny that hes actually about to be fired. The angrier he gets, Jim decides to write a letter of protest, then confront Cave face-to-face, particularly after seeing his name being removed from his office door. Jim is unaware that Cave is planning a promotion for Jim and has been informed of the invitation slight, an oversight. He is eager to invite Jim to the luncheon personally, which results in Jim needing to humbly request his angry letter be returned. When all is resolved, he and Ginny toast his new success and their future parenthood.
