While in the hospital, 60-year-old truck driver Elegant John (Henry Fonda) gets his rig repossessed by the finance company. Deciding that it is time to make one last perfect cross-country run, he escapes from the hospital and steals back his truck. Doing a favor for an old friend, madam Penelope (Eileen Brennan), he picks up six prostitutes (Daina House, Susan Sarandon, Melanie Mayron, Leigh French, Mews Small, and Valerie Curtin) to bring them across the border. He heads off into the night with the police on his tail, and becomes a folk hero.
