Jimmy Hale (Dick Haymes) is a successful singer. He chases Katharine "Kitten" Hilliard (Maureen OHara), a prim, bespectacled music school dean who, after traveling to the big city, transforms herself into a desirable, sophisticated lady. Jimmy isnt the only one eager to win Katharines affections: it turns out that the smooth-as-silk trumpeter and bandleader Barry Clayton (Harry James) has designs on Katharine as well.
