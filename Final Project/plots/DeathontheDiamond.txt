Unless his team can win the pennant, owner Pop Clark (David Landau) will lose his baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals. He gets Larry Kelly (Robert Young) in order to try and seal the deal. However, rival teams and mobsters are trying to stop his team from winning the pennant race, with some of his star players getting killed on and off the field.
