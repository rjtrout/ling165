The plot was not derived from Shakespeares Richard III, but rather was written by Robert N. Lee (director Rowland V. Lees brother) after reading a great deal of British history. George, Duke of Clarence (one of Richards brothers) is depicted as something less than the tragically noble figure found in Shakespeare. Ian Hunter portrays Edward IV, who is not depicted here as the feeble, dying King found in Laurence Oliviers 1955 film version of Shakespeares play.
