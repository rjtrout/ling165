Somewhat fictionalized account of the destruction of the village of Lidice in Czechoslovakia and the events leading up to it. In 1942, the Allies parachuted a Czech resistance fighter into the area. He quickly reunites with his former girlfriend and many of the villagers who knew him from before the war. The Nazis are under the command of Reinhard Heydrich who rules the country with an iron fist, arbitrarily arresting innocents and charging them with fictitious crimes. When Heydrich dies from wounds received in a roadside attack, SS chief Heinrich Himmler orders the destruction of Lidice. The men are herded into a church which is set aflame and the women are sent to concentration camps. The town itself is leveled.
