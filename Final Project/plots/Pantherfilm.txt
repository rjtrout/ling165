The film focuses on the rise and decline of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, known as the Black Panthers, during the Black Power movement and disenchantment with nonviolent resistance as a tool in the Civil Rights Movement. It explores the COINTELPRO program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which was an effort to track and disrupt African-American political movements. The drama alleges that various Mob networks cooperated directly with the United States Intelligence Community (FBI/CIA) representatives to "flood" inner-city ghettos, which contained majority black populations, with hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine. The endings structure and concluding voice-over alleges that The Mob (possibly Italian) in the United States agreed to produce and distribute quantities of these types of drugs on an unprecedentedly large scale. Purportedly, only agreed-upon "problem areas" of Black Panthers potential support would be targeted, so as to "pacify" those populations. The film further suggests that the huge quantities of drugs quickly spilled out of the "problem areas" and became the drug epidemic in the United States of the 1980s and 1990s. The final lines shown in the films closing note that in the 1970s, there were hundreds of thousands of hard-drug addicts, a number that had increased to the "3 million" of "yesterday". It is dedicated to the Black Panther Partys main figures, the communities that supported them, and those who might continue the struggle today.
