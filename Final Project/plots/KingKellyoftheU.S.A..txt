James W. Kelly (Guy Robertson) and his pal Happy Moran (Edgar Kennedy) are taking their all-girl-dancing troupe across the ocean to tour Europe, when Kelly and the mysterious Catherine Bell (Irene Ware), fall for each other, literally. When their backers pull out, Happy and Kelly manage to scrounge enough dough to get the girls back home; but, find themselves broke, in Europe, in a tiny country where the GDP is measured in mops. As a crooner, Kelly tries to sell enough mops, with a radio show, to pull the kingdom out of bankruptcy, and win Princess Tania, aka Catherine Bell, from their shipboard romance. Time is running out, as Prince Alexis, (William Orlamond), invades, from the neighbouring country, to seize the castle and marry the Princess. Their only defence is the women and their “Personality Mops”, when the army quits, over back wages; and, Kelly is being marched off in front of a firing squad.
