The top reporter on the Chronicle is a woman, "Timmy" Blake, who is engaged to marry Bill Morgan, her editor. Morgan assigns her to investigate the death of wealthy Spencer Wade, who left a note implicating Eugene Forde, his doctor. Timmy believes that the victims widow, Arline, is responsible. She goes to nightclub owner Sam Sherman to find out the name of a man Arline was seen with there. It turns out to be Carlton Whitney, a known gigolo. Arline sues for libel when Timmy publishes a story implicating her. She is placed on trial for murder. It turns out Whitney has been blackmailing her, but when Wade suspected her of an affair, his suicide note implicated Forde by mistake. Timmy and Morgan get the story straightened out, and Arline ends up marrying the doctor.
