A down on his luck, former Green Beret captain, freshly discharged from the Vietnam War, drifts into Drury, Kansas. There he finds a derelict merry-go-round that he decides to restore. The people of the town have mixed reactions: some support his efforts while others hinder them. Among his supporters are two local business men: a hardware store owner and Mike, a gas station proprietor. Both men supply employment to the veteran as well as parts and tools for his endeavor. Another helpful character is a young local girl, who watches the reconstruction efforts from afar, and scampers off when she is seen. The girl provides a tool box and some food. Detractors of the veterans efforts include a band of local teenagers. The protagonist is also harassed by the towns sheriff. When the towns ruffians vandalize the half-restored carousel, the soldier redoubles his efforts. By this time he has found, to his displeasure, that Mikes favorite pastime is to officiate the weekly cock fights, and the two have a falling-out. Mike refuses to make good on a promise of a much needed part for the carousel, unless the soldier agrees to fight a dog. The soldier reluctantly agrees to the fight during which he kills the dog. After installing the last piece that completes the carousels restoration, he lays the dogs body inside it, starts it up and walks away, while the townspeople look on.
