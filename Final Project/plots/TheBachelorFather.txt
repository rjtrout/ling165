Ageing English bachelor Sir Basil Winterton (C. Aubrey Smith) suddenly has his hands full when his three grown (illegitimate) children return. Tony (Marion Davies) is a sharp tongued New Yorker, Maria is an aspiring opera singer and Ray Milland is the son. Tony and Basil grow fond of each other, as do Tony and Ashley, but Sir Basils Lawyer strikes when Tony learns that she is not really the daughter of Sir Basil. Sir Basil soon learns of the mistake and confronts Tony. She leaves Basils estate and on flying back to the United States her plane crashes on take-off as Sir Basil reads a telegram that Tony sent before she boarded the plane. It explained that she loved him very much and she was sorry for what had happened. Luckily Tony has survived the disaster and is carried into Sir Basils living room to rest by Ashley. The film ends happily with Sir Basil promising to adopt Tony and Ashley promising to make her his wife.
