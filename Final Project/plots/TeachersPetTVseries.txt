The series follows Leonard Helperman (voiced by future singer Shaun Fleming of the indie rock bands Diane Coffee and Foxygen), a 9-year-old boy in the 4th grade, who lives in fear because his mother, Mary Helperman, is his teacher. Because of this, he is often teased and called a "teachers pet", but he wants to be considered normal. Meanwhile, his dog Spot (voiced by Nathan Lane) misses Leonard while hes at school, and yearns to be a human boy. So on the first day of the school year, he decides to come to class disguised as a new student named Scott Leadready II, who quickly becomes the coolest, dreamiest kid in school. However, Leonard eventually finds out his secret. Although he disapproves of this at first, he allows Spot to come to school.
