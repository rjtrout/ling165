A good-hearted and patriotic Italian immigrant barber Tony Pasqual (Leo Carrillo) who takes pity on embittered war veteran Bob Richards (Eddie Garr). When Richards robs him, Pasqual responds by helping Richards find a job. Richards dies while trying to rescue young Dickie Chester (Dickie Moore) from illicit gambling, and Pasqual takes in Chester and his mother (Lois Wilson). Big Joe Reardon (Henry Clive) is unsuccessful in using public displays of charitable good deeds to fool Pasqual into believing that hes not the neighborhood crime boss, so he has the barber shop destroyed. Pasqual gets Reardon apprehended by the police by telling his story on radio.
