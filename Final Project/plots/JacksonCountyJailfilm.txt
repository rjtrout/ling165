Dinah Hunter (Mimieux) works for a Los Angeles advertising agency and has been involved in a two-year romantic relationship. After she catches the man being unfaithful to her, Dinah quits her job and drives to New York for a fresh start. On a rural highway in the West, she picks up two hitchhikers. They rob and assault her, stealing her purse and car. A law enforcement officer then places Dinah herself under arrest when she can produce no identification. He locks her in a cell of the Jackson County jail, where one of the guards brutally beats and rapes her. Dinah kills her rapist jailer and escapes with the help of Coley, a thief who likes to hijack trucks. A bond forms between them as Dinah and Coley flee the law, even though he could be a deranged killer as well. They make a stand together in a final climatic car chase and shootout with police which results in Coley being killed and Dinah being wounded and captured by the corrupt policemen of Jackson County.
