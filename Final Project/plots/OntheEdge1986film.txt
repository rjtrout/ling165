A gaunt, bushy-bearded, 44-year-old Wes Holman returns to his northern California roots after a 20-year absence, determined to enter one of Americas oldest distance races. Holman was banned from competition after being a whistle-blower about illegal under-the-table payments to amateur athletes two decades before. He seeks out his old trainer, Elmo, to help get him ready for his comeback, but is denied official entry. After visiting with his aging father "Flash," a union-organizing radical who lives in a junkyard, Holman decides to enter the race without permission. As he negotiates the harrowing 7.5-mile trails, race organizers make strenuous attempts to impede Holman or force him out of the competition before the finish line. His fellow athletes protect his flanks, however, and escort him all the way to a victorious finish.
