Joe Tynan is a liberal U.S. senator from New York with possible presidential ambitions. For the time being, he is weighing the nomination of a potential Supreme Court justice, with the elderly Sen. Birney urging him strongly to support the nominee. Tynan is married with two children, and his frequent work-related absence is an occupational hazard tolerated by wife Ellie, who is busy studying for a new career as a therapist. When he travels to Louisiana to investigate the nominated judge, he encounters labor lawyer Karen Traynor, who knows of evidence revealing the nominee to be unfit. Their time together results in Tynan and the married Karen beginning a romantic affair. While back in Washington, D.C., engaging in a friendly rivalry with Southern senator Kittner and preparing for the partys upcoming national convention, Tynan begins to realize that Sen. Birney is suffering from a form of early dementia. Ellie, meanwhile, discovers his relationship with Karen, causing considerable friction at home. Tynan breaks off the affair and makes amends to his wife as he delivers a speech at the convention.
