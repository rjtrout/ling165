After foiling a phony suicide attempt by Connie Madigan, an aspiring actress seeking publicity by stepping onto a ledge, Dr. Tim Kane, who practices medicine in the Broadway district of New York City, vouches for her to keep Connie from being arrested and hires her as his assistant. Doc is warned by his Broadway cronies about gangster Vic Telli being released from prison. Docs testimony had put Vic behind bars. Vic turns up, but impressed by Docs honesty, says he is dying and asks Doc to find his long-missing daughter, Margie Dove, so he can bequeath her his fortune. Vic ends up dead with rival racketeer Jack Venner trying to get his money, assisted by a woman pretending to be Margie. In the end, Docs life is saved by Connie going back out onto the ledge, tossing a shoe at the people below. The police nab the villain and Doc helps Connie back inside, but not before kissing her.
