A daydreamer, Georgie Allertons imagination goes to work while she falls in love with her sister Miriams husband-to-be, Jim Lucas. She closes her eyes and has a fantasy of what life with Ji would be like, ignoring the genuine attentions of Clark Redfield, an honest but poor newspaper reporter. Jim goes through with the marriage to Miriam, which leaves Georgie considering an offer from suitor George Hand to go to Mexico with him. Another daydream begins, in which Georgie is now a singer in a tropical setting, killing herself after a tragic love affair. Jims publishing business and marriage go badly, resulting in a trip to Reno for a quick divorce. He actually has fallen for Georgie now, but this time, when her reverie results in her dreaming about a life on a ranch, Clarks wooing wins her over and she wakes up to realize shes in love.
