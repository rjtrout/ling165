The film tells the story of Elizabeth (Colbert) and John (Welles), a married couple recently separated when John goes off to fight in World War I. When Elizabeth receives notice of Johns death, she marries another man (George Brent). John, however, is still alive, and later returns, but after being disfigured in the war he has undergone plastic surgery, making him almost unrecognizable. He has also adopted an eight-year old daughter (Wood). When he finds out that he has a son with Elizabeth, he is faced with the dilemma of whether or not to reveal his true identity.
