The film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa. The main character of the film is an American citizen named Michael Woods (Walker), who has recently been released from prison on parole. Once free, he is immediately sent on a far-away journey to meet his beloved. Caught in a strange city, Michael becomes the target of a massive police manhunt after inadvertently picking up a rental car with a female whistle blower tied up in the trunk. In the confusion, he decides to leave the car at a dump, but suddenly the phone rings. He is asked to continue on. Later, the whistle blower tells Michael that she was abducted and was meant to be killed - she knew too much about the involvement of local police in the criminal business. As the police attempt to silence the woman before she can testify about the citys chief of police, the ex-con, who has just regained his freedom, must clear his own name.
