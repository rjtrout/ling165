The 3D Concert Experience follows the Jonas Brothers during their Burnin Up Tour in a behind-the-scenes look at their busy schedule while in New York City, as they do interviews and television performances to promote the release of their third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, from August 9–11, 2008 and ending their day-long press tour in Madison Square Garden. The film intercuts to concert performances off their self-titled second studio album and third studio album, filmed during their tour on July 13–14, 2008 in Anaheim. Performing alongside the Jonas Brothers are guest stars Demi Lovato on "This Is Me", Taylor Swift on "Shouldve Said No" and the brothers bodyguard Robert "Big Rob" Feggans on "Burnin Up". The film also debuted two new studio recordings, "Love Is On Its Way", which was filmed in Central Park, and "Live to Party", which would later serve as the theme song for their Disney Channel TV series.
