Charlotte Bronn (Jean Simmons) is a neglected wife who leaves the Maraneck State Hospital mental institution in New England, after a year there, to resume her life in a chilly relationship with her distant and emotionally repressed professor husband, in their plush New England home. They all live together with Charlottes step-sister Joan (Rhonda Fleming) as well as Joans mother, the scattered chatterer Inez (Mabel Albertson). They also have a boarder, Dr. Jake Diamond (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.), who according to Arnold (Dan OHerlihy) has been experiencing anti-Semitism at the college where they both teach. Arnold shuns Charlotte, sleeping on the couch instead of in their bed, keeping away from her with a multitude of excuses, while chumming around with Joan. Part of Charlottes commitment to the mental facility hinged on her continuing suspicions of an attraction between her husband and her beautiful step-sister. Inez bosses Charlotte mercilessly while a maid in their kitchen scolds her.  Diamond disconcertedly is a calm, pipe smoking, handsome figure who shows Charlotte gentle and knowing sympathy, tempting her into a romantic relationship.  Two acquaintances, Hamilton Gregory (Steve Dunne) and Cathy Bergner (Joanna Barnes), separately imply to her that an affair between Arnold and Joan is a reality. Charlotte walks several miles through the snow to the college to confront her husband. Later, before a dinner with important faculty, she comes dressed and coiffed to resemble Joan, disrupting the dinner and appearing to be headed toward another breakdown. She also learns from Diamond that his chance for promotion at the college was sabotaged by Arnold. Charlotte agrees to a divorce. Diamond asks her to join him in New York.
