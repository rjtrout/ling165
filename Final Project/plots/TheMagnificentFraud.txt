Akim Tamiroff plays an actor performing in a nameless Latin American country who is pressed into service when the president is fatally injured by a bomb. Impersonating the president, the actor balances the pleasures and temptations of office, dangerous palace intrigue, and his duty to the people of the country. The plot is identical to the 1988 Richard Dreyfuss film Moon over Parador; both are based on a short story by Charles G. Booth called Caviar for His Excellency. Parts of the film were shot in Balboa Park in San Diego.
