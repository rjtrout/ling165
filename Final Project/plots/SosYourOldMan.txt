Sam Bisbee (W.C. Fields) is a small-town glazier whos always trying to get rich quick, and his schemes are driving his wife (Marcia Harris) crazy. When he invents an unbreakable glass windshield, his attempt to demonstrate it at a convention of automobile manufacturers is ruined when his car gets switched with another, and instead of bouncing off, the brick he throws at it smashes the windshield to pieces. On the train ride home, Bisbee considers suicide, but instead rescues a pretty young woman (Alice Joyce) who he believe is trying to kill herself. It turns out the woman is really Princess Lescaboura, and their friendship brings social success to the Bisbees.
