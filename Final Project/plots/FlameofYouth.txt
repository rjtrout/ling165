After his daughter, nicknamed Jerry, is arrested for stealing hubcaps off cars, naive George Briggs picks her up at jail. She immediately goes to gangster Cicero Coletti to get her cut of the stolen loot, quarreling with Colettis sister, Lila. Jerry pays her dads tab when bookie Deke Edwards demands he pay up or else. She ignores sister Catherines pleas to get out of petty crime and concentrate on becoming a fashion model instead. Instead, she tries to rob the cash from a junkyard, as does Lila, who is shot by the owner. Jerry escapes, ripping her pants on a wire fence. Catherine repays the stolen loot to the junkyards owner, but George inadvertently identifies the torn pants as hers when the police come to investigate. Catherine and Jerry are both placed under arrest. Deke shoots an innocent friend of Jerry, who finally sees the error of her ways as she is taken to jail.
