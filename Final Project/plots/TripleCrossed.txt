Larry is a womanizer who is having an affair with Moes wife Belle (Mary Ainslee). At the same time, he is also making eyes at Joes fiancee, Millie (Angela Stevens). However, Moe tracks down the conniving Larry at his pet shop, and gives him the works before Larry calms him down. Realizing he needs to cover his tracks, Larry looks for a "fall guy" in the form of Joe. Larry then gets Joe a job as an underwear salesman and the first place he goes is Moes home. While Joe is modeling his ware, Larry lies to Moe about Joes advances on Millie. Both of them go storming over to Moes, while Joe flees up the chimney. After making a quiet getaway, Joe bumps into Larry, and turns him in. Joe explains to Moe how Larry had set him up. Millie reveals how Larry had tricked her into coming there. Moe tells her Larry had tricked him, too. Millie and Joe make up while an angry Moe punishes Larry.
