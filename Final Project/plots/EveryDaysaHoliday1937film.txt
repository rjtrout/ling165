In turn-of-the-century New York City, con artist Peaches ODay (West) gets into trouble with the law for trying to sell the Brooklyn Bridge, but Jim McCarey (Lowe), a police captain, likes her enough that he lets her off with a promise from Peaches to leave town. She hatches a scheme instead with the wealthy Van Doon (Winninger) and butler Graves (Butterworth) to perform as a singer, calling herself Fifi, disguised in a black wig. Quade (Lloyd Nolan), a chief of police with political ambitions, makes a pass at "Fifi" and is rejected. In anger, he orders the club closed. Capt. McCarey refuses and becomes Quades rival, even persuaded to run against him for mayor. Before giving a speech at Madison Square Garden during the campaign, McCarey is kidnapped. He escapes just in time and the publicity is helpful in his election victory. It turns out that Peaches planned the whole thing, resulting in a romantic relationship with the new mayor of New York.
