A comedy about marriage and everything relating to it. New York novelist Henry Fonda meets up with an actress, Margaret Sullavan, and the two date and later marry, though neither knows of the others fame. The real adventure begins on the honeymoon, when this screwball comedy really heats up with insults and arguments.
