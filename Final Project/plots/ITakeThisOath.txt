Police officer Mike Hanagan (Robert Homans) attempts to expose a fraudulent official who works with a gang of racketeers, but the official has Hanagan murdered. Hanagans son Steve (Gordon Jones) decides to avenge his father, and at the suggestion of his girlfriend Betty Casey (Joyce Compton) he joins the police force. Under the instruction of Daniel Casey (Guy Usher), Bettys father, Steve begins learning how to be an officer. However, as he has become so dedicated to finding his fathers murderer, he begins to fall behind on his law studies, and due to his poor grades he is dismissed from the force. Steve believes he has found the clue that points to his friend Joe Kellys (Craig Reynolds) uncle Jim Kelly (Sam Flint) being the murderer. When Jim hears that Steve suspects him, he decides that Steve must be killed. A struggle ensues between Steve and Jim, and a bullet is fired at Steve but Joe is hit instead and Steve then shoots Jim. Impressed, Casey returns to allow Steve back onto the police force.
