Paul Montgomery (James Caan) and his wife Jennifer (Katharine Ross) are a pair of wealthy but blas√© Upper East Side New York socialites with an attitude sometimes accompanying the overprivileged: a propensity to amuse themselves in a bizarre, chic and upscale fashion, in this case playing socialite "games" for their peers and occasionally revealing what appears to be a playfully sadistic streak. Lisa Schindler (Simone Signoret), an older woman from Germany, arrives at their door one day selling cosmetics; the couple invite her in and when the conversation reveals that Lisa is believed to have psychic abilities, Paul and Jennifer ask her to arrange some "games" for their amusement. Lisa proceeds to set up several situations of simulated domestic discord that the couple can react to. Things turn deadly when an acquaintance, Norman, is accidentally killed during a so-called "game". He was killed with a gunshot wound in the right eye. Paul has to go to enormous lengths to conceal any evidence. He fears being blackmailed by Lisa, whose psychic activities continue and intensify during her stay. Ultimately, at the request of Paul, Lisa leaves, for the welfare of an ever more anxious Jennifer. Ultimately, after a tense confrontation between Jennifer and the supposedly murdered man, Jennifer actually does shoot and kill him, at which point Paul walks in and calmly calls the police to report that his wife has committed murder. It turns out that Paul and Lisa had orchestrated the entire affair all along in order to trick Jennifer into killing someone so that Paul could get her fortune. The murdered man had been in on the "game", but was double-crossed. Paul and Lisa share a celebratory drink as Paul pays Lisa her ten-percent cut and they prepare to go their separate ways. Unfortunately for Paul, Lisa has poisoned his drink. After Paul collapses and dies, Lisa takes the briefcase containing all of the money, leaves the house, and walks down the street.
