In a cultured and peaceful home on the outskirts of London, the head of the household, Roger Balfour, is found dead from what initially appears to be a self-inflicted bullet wound, despite the insistence of Balfours friend and neighbor, Sir James Hamlin, that his friend would never have taken his own life. Nonetheless, Balfours death is officially declared a suicide by an Inspector Edward C. Burke of Scotland Yard. Some five years later, with the case still unresolved, a sinister-looking man dressed in black with pointed teeth arrives at the household accompanied by a cadaverous-looking woman in a long gown; the arrival of these two individuals prompts Sir James Hamlin, the friend and neighbor of the late Roger Balfour, to call Scotland Yard. This in turn prompts Inspector Burke to travel to the household, where he discovers that three individuals now present in the household had been the only three who had been present five years previously when Roger Balfour had died. Initially, Burke remains skeptical that any of these three individuals (Balfours daughter, his butler, and Arthur Hibbs, the nephew of the neighbor who had placed the call to Scotland Yard) may have been involved in his murder, until Balfours body disappears from its tomb and an individual looking distinctly like him is seen around the household. This, in addition to other eerie acts such as instances of singular gunshots being heard in Roger Balfours former bedroom occurring in the household while Burke is there and the sinister-looking man in black repeatedly terrifying those within the household, prompts him to determine to identify Balfours killer by reproducing the former crime scene and using hypnosis to induce the culprit into re-enacting the murder.
