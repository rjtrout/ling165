In real life however Kathy is anything but sweet and instead acts as a self-centered brat. Publicity agent Harry Johnson (Dan Duryea) is tasked by the studio with the job of keeping a national magazine reporter, Celeste Saunders (Jan Sterling) from discovering that their child star is a devil and not an angel. His task is complicated by the fact that Celeste is his ex-wife. Much to his surprise Celeste and Kathy become great friends because Celeste treats Kathy like a kid and not a star. However, when Kathy runs away to be with Celeste, its Harry who gets accused of kidnapping Kathy.
