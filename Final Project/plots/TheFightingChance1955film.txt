After a dispute over money, trainer Bill Binyon and a young jockey, Mike Gargan, quit working for thoroughbred owner Al Moreno, whose girlfriend Janet Wales leaves him as well. Bill and Mike go to California, where they are employed by "Lucky Jim" Morrisons stable. A flirtatious Janet turns up and draws interest from both men. Mike also is infatuated with Miss Ellen, a filly he believes could become a champion racehorse. Janet turns out to be a devious, scheming woman, attempting to make both men jealous. After she declines Mikes marriage proposal, he disappears to Mexico, where he gambles, drinks and neglects his career. Bill takes a chance by marrying Janet, but her lavish spending habits leaves them bickering and broke. Morrisons death from a heart attack results in his horses, Miss Ellen, coming up for auction. Mike returns and outbids Bill for the filly, then reluctantly accepts a loan and partnership when Bill lends him enough money to make the purchase. With a race coming up that offers a $400,000 prize, the horse is not in perfect health, but Janet wants the money and persuades Bill and Mike to enter Miss Ellen in the race. In the saddle, Mike has to ease up when the horse begins bleeding. Miss Ellen finishes second. A furious Janet derides both men as losers, announcing she and Bill are through. Unbeknownst to her, Bill bet on their horse across the board (win, place and show). He throws $40,000 worth of tickets in Janets face. When she picks them up, he hits Janet with the horses whip. Bill and Mike walk away, resuming their partnership and friendship.
