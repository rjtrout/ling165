In 1944, Captain Josiah Newman (Peck) is head of the neuro-psychiatric Ward 7 at the Colfax Army Air Field military hospital, located in the Arizona desert. As he explains to a visiting VIP who wanders in: "Were short of beds, doctors, orderlies, nurses, everything ... except patients." He will use unconventional tactics to treat his patients and to recruit much needed personnel, as when he hijacks a new and very reluctant orderly, Corporal Jackson Leibowitz (Curtis), a wheeler-dealer from New Jersey. Leibowitz promptly has the entire ward participating in a sing-along of "Old MacDonald Had a Farm." Newman also takes great pains to court nurse Lieutenant Francie Corum (Dickinson) on what she thinks is a date... until he asks her to transfer to Ward 7. Their date/fight is cut short by a phone call: Colonel Bliss (Albert) has forced his way into Ward 7 looking for Dr. Newman with a 6-inch knife, because Newman blocked his return to active duty after witnessing Bliss erratic behavior. After watching Newmans handling of this situation and other patients on the ward, Corum transfers in. Newman treats shell-shocked, schizophrenic and catatonic patients, facing an especial challenge from the traumatized Corporal Jim Tompkins (Darin), an Eighth Air Force air gunner whose mind has been shattered by his war experiences. He is bedeviled by Colfax AAFs "old-school" base commander, Colonel Pyser (James Gregory), who ultimately saddles him with a complement of injured Italian POWs because his is the only secure ward in the hospital. In addition, a flock of constantly straying sheep (kept for the medical lab) that find their way to the airfield and a set of feuding orderlies keeps life interesting right up to Christmas 1944.
