A rogue exile impersonates a King and a virtuous person wants to be so because he is the rightful heir to the throne. Loosely based on The Brigand by Alexandre Dumas, the film is set in the Napoleonic era in 1804 in the mythical Iberian nation of "Mandorra". The film bears a resemblance to The Prisoner of Zenda with Dexter playing a dual role of a rogue exile who impersonates a King in danger of being overthrown by his cousin played by Anthony Quinn. The scheming Quinn plans a "premeditated accident" to King Lorenzo by giving him a hunting weapon that is rigged to fire backwards; an idea reused by director Phil Karlson in his The Silencers. With the real King unable to perform his duties, the swashbuckling distant relative Carlos DeLago, late of the Sultan of Moroccos Guard steps in to save the Kingdom.
