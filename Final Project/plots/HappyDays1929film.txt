Originally titled New Orleans Frolic, the story centers around Margie (played by Marjorie White), a singer on a showboat who, when she hears that the showboat is in financial trouble, travels to New York City in an effort to persuade all the boats former stars to perform in a show to rescue it. She is successful and the stars all fly to New Orleans to surprise the showboats owner, Colonel Billy Blacher, with a grand show, the proceeds of which will go to rescue the showboat.
