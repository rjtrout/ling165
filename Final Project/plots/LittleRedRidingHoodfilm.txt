This version of the classic childrens story employs elements of black comedy. The black-and-white scenario shows the forest of the tale, and narrator Quentin Crisp is the only voice heard in the film. An androgynous anthropomorphized black wolf, portrayed by ballet dancer Timour Bourtasenkov, tries to trick Little Red Riding Hood. He successfully eats her grandmother, and then tries to eat her. However, she tricks him and survives. She is clever enough manage without being rescued by the huntsman, often included in versions of the tale, and does not "rescue" the eaten grandmother at all; she in fact eats her grandmothers flesh as well, even after being warned by a cat. She is thus portrayed, in another contrast to traditional depictions of the story, as being less than innocent.
