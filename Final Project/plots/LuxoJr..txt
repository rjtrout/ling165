In a dark room, a large illuminated balanced-arm desk lamp named Luxo Sr. sees a small yellow ball with a blue stripe and a red star on the front rolling up to it. Luxo Sr. eyes the ball curiously, and pushes it away, but the ball comes back to it. It pushes it away again. The ball comes back to it, but this time, it rolls past it. A smaller desk lamp, named Luxo Jr., appears and continues playing with the ball. Luxo Jr. then balances itself on top of the ball, causing it to deflate. Luxo Jr. flips the deflated ball onto its side and looks up at Luxo Sr. who admonishes Luxo Jr. Luxo Jr. then hops off-screen and is later seen playing with a beach ball. Luxo Sr. looks at the camera, then shakes its head in embarrassment.
