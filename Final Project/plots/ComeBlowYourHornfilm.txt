Buddy Baker is bored living with his parents. He goes to the big-city apartment of older brother Alan, who works for their fathers artificial-fruit company but never lets business interfere with a good time. A confirmed bachelor, Alan is all too willing to teach his younger brother a few tricks, improve his wardrobe, even introduce him to Peggy, a girl with an apartment upstairs. Alans steadiest companion is Connie, but even shes running out of patience with his lack of interest in settling down. A jealous husband accuses Alan of running around with his wife and beats him up. Alan begins rethinking his life. He proposes marriage to Connie and then intervenes when he hears that his own parents are contemplating a divorce. Giving up his own ways for good, Alan even turns over his swinging bachelor pad to Buddy.
