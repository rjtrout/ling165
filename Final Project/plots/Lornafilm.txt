The publicity to Lorna exclaimed: "Without artistic surrender, without compromise, without question or apology, an important motion picture was produced: LORNAâ€”a woman too much for one man." Lorna (Lorna Maitland) is a sexually unsatisfied young wife married to Jim (James Rucker), who works at a salt mine and spends his evenings studying to become a CPA. When Lorna goes for a nude swim in the river, she is raped by an escaped convict (Mark Bradley), but her frustrated sexuality is awakened. She invites the stranger to their home while Jim is at work. Meanwhile, Jims co-workers tease him about his wifes beauty and infidelity. Jim returns home early and discovers Lornas unfaithfulness. The events take place on Jim and Lornas anniversary, which Jim has forgotten.
