Based on the 1962 novel of the same name, Youngblood Hawke is about a Kentucky truck driver (James Franciscus), who moves to New York City with dreams of becoming a hot-shot writer. Almost immediately he meets editor Jeanne Green (Suzanne Pleshette). She sees great promise in Hawkes writing and falls for the handsome Kentuckian while helping him put together his first book deal. His first novel is moderately successful, but is soon transformed into a Broadway play by a has-been stage actress. Jeanne discovers that Youngblood has an effect on a great many women, so she takes a new job at a new publishing company. Soon after, Hawkes second novel is heralded and he becomes the toast of the town. He then has an affair with a married socialite. His third novel bombs and is also panned by critics. Hawkes financial state declines and he has to move back to Kentucky. While in Kentucky working on his next book, he contracts pneumonia just before realizing that Jeanne was his true ideal woman.
