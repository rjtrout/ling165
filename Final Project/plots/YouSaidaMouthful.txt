Joe Holt works for the Armstrong Rubber Goods company and believes he has invented an "unsinkable" bathing suit. His colleagues mock Joe behind his back and fool him into thinking his boss likes the swimsuit idea. Joe travels to California to inherit his aunts fortune, which he intends to use to finance manufacturing of his swimsuit. It turns out his aunt died broke. Joe befriends a servants son, Sam Wellington, and together take a boat to Santa Catalina Island. A socialite, Alice Brandon, mistakes Joe for a famous swimmer of the same name. She has just broken up with channel swimmer Ed Dover and wants him to lose an upcoming channel race, so she persuades Joe to enter. Sam needs to teach Joe how to swim. The real Joe Holt ends up in jail, being called an impostor. And in the end, amazingly, sinkable Joe impresses Alice by winning the race.
