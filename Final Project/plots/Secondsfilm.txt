Seconds is a mystery dealing with the obsession with eternal youth and a mysterious organization which gives people a second chance in life. Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) is a middle-aged man whose life has lost purpose. Hes achieved success, but finds it unfulfilling. His love for his wife has dwindled and he seldom sees his only child. Through a friend, Charlie, he thought was dead, Hamilton is approached by a secret organization, known simply as the "Company" which offers him a new life. Upon arriving for a meeting, Hamilton arrives at a meat packing plant. He is given workman overalls and hat, then exits the facility out a different door where he is next seated inside the back of a truck which proceeds to another building. He disappears into a large complex filled with dark, empty hallways where he awaits his transformation. The Company gives Hamilton the body of a young man (Rock Hudson) through plastic surgery and a new identity, namely Antiochus "Tony" Wilson. He later discovers this identity has been taken from someone who recently passed on. He is resettled into a community filled with people like him who are "reborns". Eventually, Hamilton decides the new life isnt what he wants. He contacts the Company, letting them know he wants a different identity and they agree, taking him back to wait for his new identity. There, he meets Charlie, who has also wished to go under yet another "rebirth." Charlie is chosen and walked away from the waiting room. Later during the night, the owner of the Company discusses his original purpose for founding the organization, and assures Hamilton that the issues hes brought up will be looked into. Hamilton learns as he is wheeled into the operating room, before being sedated, that he is to be killed. His body is used as the catalyst (corpse) for a new patient to be reborn. The film ends with the camera panning up to a surgical light as a drill is pushed through his head; two figures walk along a beach.
