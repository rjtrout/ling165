Reporter Michael Ward is the key witness in a murder trial. His evidence — that he saw the accused, Joe Briggs, standing over the body of a man in a diner — is instrumental in having Briggs found guilty. Afterwards, Ward’s fiancée Jane is worried whether Ward was correct in what he saw, and Ward becomes haunted by this question. Next, Ward’s neighbor is killed the same way as the man in the diner, but Ward comes under suspicion and is arrested after he finds the body, notifies the police and points out the similarities. As a result, Jane sets out to try to clear Ward by finding the odd-looking stranger Ward saw on the stairwell.
