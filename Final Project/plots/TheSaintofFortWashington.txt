Matthew is a young man with a good heart that suffers from sporadic schizophrenic tendencies. He ends up with nowhere to live after a slumlord tears down his tenement. With nowhere left to go, Matthew resides at Fort Washington Armory, a nearby shelter. Bullied by punks, Matthew turns to a homeless military veteran, Jerry, for help on how to survive. Together they form a friendship that changes both of their lives forever.
