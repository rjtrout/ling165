The quiet Arizona mining town, Prosperitys problem with giant spiders started with a simple accident where a truck carrying barrels of toxic waste swerved trying not to hit a rabbit, throwing a barrel into the reservoir. Thus, begins the food chain reaction. An exotic spider farmer named Joshua Taft (Tom Noonan) feeds his collection of spiders, which include jumping spiders, tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, male orb-weaver spiders, and a female orb-weaver named Consuela, with crickets caught from the reservoir. As a result, they grow to enormous size, with an ever-increasing appetite. They start terrorizing the town, attacking, killing, abducting and devouring people. So begins the battle between the giant spiders and the people of Prosperity.
