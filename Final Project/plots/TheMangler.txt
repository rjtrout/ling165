A police detective investigating a sudden rash of grisly deaths caused by an industrial laundry press machine discovers that a series of unfortunate coincidences involving the machine have inadvertently replicated a demon-summoning ritual. Due to various ingredients (including medicine containing extract of nightshade, a live bat, and fresh blood getting into the machine) being combined, the machine itself has become possessed by a demon. The story ends after the detective and his friend underestimate the demons power, and in seeking to exorcise the machine, instead goad it into ripping free of its moorings and prowling the streets in search of fresh prey.
