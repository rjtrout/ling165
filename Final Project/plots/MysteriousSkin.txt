During the summer of 1981 in Hutchinson, Kansas, eight-year-olds Neil McCormick and Brian Lackey, teammates in Little League, both experience life-altering events. Neil, the son of an irresponsible single mother and already discovering his homosexuality, is sexually abused by his Little League coach, who leaves town after that summer. Brian, with a neglectful father and a mother whos often working, remembers it starting to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being in a crawl space in his house with a bloody nose, having no memory of the intervening five hours. Neil views the coachs abuse as love and becomes mainly attracted to "bearish" middle-aged men. He begins prostituting himself at the age of 15. Three years later, he moves to New York City, where his best friend Wendy Peterson now lives, and continues prostituting there. Neil has an emotional encounter with a client who is dying from AIDS. Though Neil suspects the man wants sex, he actually wants nothing more than to feel another persons touch. The encounter leads Neil to start to withdraw from prostitution and take a job as a cashier. For years after coming to in the crawl space, Brian suffers from chronic nosebleeds, blackouts and bedwetting. He has unsettling recurring dreams about being touched by a strange, bluish hand. These odd dreams lead Brian to suspect that he may have been abducted by aliens. Eventually, another boy wearing the same Little League uniform begins to appear with him in these dreams. When hes 18, Brian meets a woman named Avalyn Friesen who also believes she was abducted by aliens. They begin to form a friendship, but when she comes on to him, he panics and refuses to speak to her again. While trying to untangle his confused memories, Brian sees a photo of his Little League team, recognizing a young Neil as the boy from his dreams. Taking the initiative to meet his former teammate, Brian instead meets Neils mother and his friend Eric Pressly, and through him, he learns more about Neil. After being beaten and raped by a trick, Neil returns to Hutchinson to spend Christmas with his mother. Then, Neil and Brian meet for the first time in over a decade. After breaking into the house that was previously rented by the baseball coach, Neil tells Brian what happened that night: after the baseball game was rained out and Brian didnt have a ride home, the coach offered to drive Brian home with Neil. Instead, they all went to the coachs house, where the coach performed sex acts on the boys and made them perform sex acts on each other. A porch light caused the atmosphere to have an eerie blue color. After the coach and Neil put Brians clothes back on, Brian collapsed face-first onto the floor, causing the bloody nose. Learning the truth at last, Brian breaks down crying and is comforted by Neil as Christmas carolers sing "Silent Night".
