A poor family in Florida saves all the money they can in order to plan a Sunday dinner for a soldier at a local Army airbase. They dont realize that their request to invite the soldier never got mailed. On the day of the scheduled dinner, another soldier is brought to their home and love soon blossoms between him (Hodiak) and Tessa (Baxter), the young woman who runs the home.
