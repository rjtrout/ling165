A psychiatrist, Dr. Cross (Vincent Price), is treating a young woman, Janet Stewart (Anabel Shaw), who is in a coma-state, brought on when she heard loud arguing, went to her window and saw a man strike his wife with a candlestick and kill her. Lynn Bari is Dr. Crosss nurse/lover, Elaine Jordan. As Stewart comes out of her shock, she recognizes Dr. Cross as the killer. He then takes her to his sanitarium and at Elaines urging, gives Janet an overdose of insulin under the pretense of administering insulin shock therapy. He cant bring himself to murder her in cold blood, though, and asks Elaine to get the medicine to save her. Elaine refuses, they argue, and he strangles her. A colleague of Dr. Cross, Dr. Harvey, saves Janets life and Dr. Cross is taken into custody by a lawyer from the District Attorneys office.
