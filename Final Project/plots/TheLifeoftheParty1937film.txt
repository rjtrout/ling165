On her way to Santa Barbara, California, aspiring singer Mitzi Mantos loses a shoe. A young man named Barry finds it and tries to meet her, while Mitzi and her agent Pauline try to get her an audition with Dr. Molnac for his traveling musical revue. Misunderstandings abound as Mitzi and Barry pretend to be married. Mitzi is actually the daughter of a countess, while Barry will lose a $3 million inheritance if he marries before the age of 30. Their cronies kidnap Molnacs ran singer, Susan, and, taking her place, Mitzi is a hit.
