The story follows the troubled lives of three young robbers. The first is a college dropout, and draft dodger, who plans to rob a supermarket so he can purchase a boat and escape his problems. The second is an indebted man who is responsible for the high medical bills of a con woman who hurt herself while on a date with him. The third is a pathological liar who cannot cope with his failed marriage and writing career. During the robbery, the dropout gets too wired and kills the manager. They flee, but the dropouts cohorts are captured by the cops while he steals a truck and heads screaming down the road for Mexico. A chase ensues until the trucks brakes fail and he suffers a fatal, fiery crash.
