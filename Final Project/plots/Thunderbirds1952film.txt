Close friends Gil Hackett and Tom McCreary both love and leave the same girl, Mary Caldwell, after they are called up to the Oklahoma National Guard and then on to the Army for wartime duty in 1940. A tough, stoic sergeant named Logan keeps an eye on them as the unit ships out to Europe following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Tom speaks of his father, who supposedly died a heros death in the First World War, but another soldier claims hes heard that Toms father was disgraced and dishonorably discharged. Mary reveals that Tom is the one she loves. Gil finds solace in meeting Lt. Ellen Henderson, a nurse. The fighting continues in Italy and Sicily and when Tom ends up missing, Logan will not permit a search. Logan later heroically reports a movement of German tanks just before being shot. With the invasion of Southern France at hand, it is learned that Logan had been court-martialed during World War I for authorizing a search party that led to the death of more soldiers. He reenlisted under a false name to prove himself again, particularly to Tom, who is actually his son.
