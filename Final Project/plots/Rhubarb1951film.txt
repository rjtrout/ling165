Thaddeus J. Banner (Gene Lockhart), a lonely, eccentric millionaire who owns a baseball team, the Brooklyn Loons, takes a liking to a dog-chasing stray cat (played by Orangey), and takes him into his home. He names the cat "Rhubarb," which is baseball slang for an on-field argument or fight. When the man dies, it is discovered that his last will and testament made Rhubarb his sole beneficiary; hence the cat inherits the baseball team. Team publicist Eric Yeager (Ray Milland) is named the cats guardian. His fianc√©e Polly Sickles (Jan Sterling), daughter of the teams manager (William Frawley), is terribly allergic to Rhubarb, causing many problems. Banners unhappy daughter Myra (Elsie Holmes) files a lawsuit, contesting the will. And when the teams players discover they are owned by a cat, they stage a protest until Yeager persuades them that Rhubarb brings them luck. Brooklyn begins winning and will play the powerful New York team for the championship. But a bookie who stands to lose big if Brooklyn wins decides to kidnap the cat. Brooklyns fortunes turn for the worse while the search for Rhubarb goes on, until the cat finally escapes from his captors and races to the ballpark to save the day.
