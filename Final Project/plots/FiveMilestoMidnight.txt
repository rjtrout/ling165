Immediately after Lisa (Loren) declares that she is leaving her immature, abusive, but easy-going husband Robert (Perkins), he is reported dead in a plane crash. Secretly still alive, he convinces her to collect his life insurance, although she knows that its a bad idea. Lisa must contend with the complications of the scheme, which involve an aggressive suitor (Gig Young), Roberts jealousy, and her own guilt. Eventually the stress of putting up with Robert is too much for Lisa, and she runs over him and disposes of the body and car in a lake. The suitor realizes what she did as she has a mental breakdown and calls the police. The film takes place primarily in Paris. Lisa is Italian; Robert is American.
