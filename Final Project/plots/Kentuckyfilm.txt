During the Civil War, Thad Goodwin, Sr., (Charles Waldron) of Elmtree Farm, a local horse breeder resists Capt. John Dillon (Douglass Dumbrille) and a company of Union soldiers confiscating his prize horses. He is killed by Dillon and his youngest son Peter (Bobs Watson) cries at the soldiers riding away with the horses. 75 years later, in 1938, Peter (Walter Brennan) now a crotchety old man, still resides on Elmtree Farm and raises horses with his niece Sally (Loretta Young). Dillons grandson Jack (Richard Greene) and Sally meet, her not knowing that he was a Dillon. Sallys father Thad Goodwin, Jr., dies when his speculation on cotton drops. The Goodwins are forced to auction off nearly all their horses and Jack offers his services to Sally, as a trainer of their last prize horse, "Bessies Boy", who is later injured. Sally eventually loses the farm, and Mr. Dillon makes good on his original bet with Thad Jr. and offers her any two-year-old on his farm. She picks "Blue Grass" instead of the favorite, "Postman", and Jack trains him for the Derby. She eventually learns of Jacks real identity and fires him as trainer. During the race, Blue Grass runs neck and neck with the Dillons horse Postman, but Blue Grass wins thanks to Jacks advice. Sally embraces Jack, but Peter collapses before the decoration ceremony and dies. At his funeral, Dillon eulogizes him and of the American life of the past, as "The Grand Old Man of the American Turf".
