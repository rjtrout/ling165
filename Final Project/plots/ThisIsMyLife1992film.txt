The film tells the story of Dottie Ingels (Julie Kavner), who works at a cosmetics counter but aspires to be a stand-up comedian. Ingels Aunt Harriet dies and leaves the family her home in Queens which Ingels then sells to move to an apartment in Manhattan. Ingels comedy career starts to take off with the help of her agent, Arnold Moss (Dan Aykroyd) and Mosss assistant, Claudia Curtis (Carrie Fisher). Ingels children, Erica (Samantha Mathis) and Opal (Gaby Hoffmann) get angry at Dottie because they hardly ever see her. Erica and Opal then run away to find their father in upstate Albany, whom Opal doesnt even remember, only being 1 or 2 years old when he left them. The character portrayed by Aykroyd, Arnold Moss, is based on the famous New York talent agent Sam Cohn, and has some of the eccentricities for which Cohn was known, such as a habit of eating paper.
