In 18th century upstate New York, a quarrelsome white man named Butler seeks to foment war with the Indians, to rid the Mohawk Valley of the natives and settlers he despises. He goes to the Iroquois chef Kowanen to warn him about a party of armed white settlers. Kowanen shows no concern, but his son Keoga and brave Rokhawah feel otherwise and plot a raid to steal the settlers muskets. They are assisted by Keogas sister Onida, but many Indians end up killed and Onida captured. An artist, Jonathan Adams, has arrived from Boston, commissioned to do paintings and portraits. He is joined by sweetheart Cynthia Stanhope, a society lady from Boston, and attracted to Greta Jones, a local barmaid. But when he escorts Onida from the fort back to her people, he develops a romantic interest in her instead. Adams also earns the respect and trust of Kowanen as he paints the chiefs portrait and Keoga comes to admire Adams fighting prowess. Kowanen, seeking peace with the white settlers, offers to have his son Keoga accompany Adams back to the fort, as a sign of good faith. As the two peace emissaries are en route to the fort, Butler stages an ambush, murdering Keoga. Chief Kowanens men hold the whites responsible and take Adams captive, but he escapes, aided by Onida. When Adams finally reaches the fort, he reveals Butlers perfidy. As the enraged Indians attack, Butler is cast out of the besieged fort and meets his end in a hail of Indian arrows. A truce is declared, and while Cynthia goes back to Boston with his works of art, Adams remains behind to be with Onida.
