Clint Saunders is dismissed from his job as the White Palace saloons card dealer after coming to work late. He doesnt mind, wishing to leave for Colorado and the lucrative silver mines there. Saloon owner Tacey Cromwell, in love with Clint, decides to leave with him and Clints little brother Nugget, even though Clint doesnt wish to settle down. In their new town, Clint becomes acquainted with prosperous Judith Watrous, a senators daughter, who offers him a job running her bank and is obviously attracted to him. Tacey does her best to make a proper home for Nugget and for a young tomboy, Seely Dowder, taking in the girl when she becomes an orphan. The haughty Judith learns of Taceys past life, after having hired a private investigator and jealously has custody of the children taken from Tacey while Clint is out of town. A broken-hearted Tacey returns to her old saloon job, while Clint remains behind and marries Judith. As years go by, Seely grows up and encounters Tacey again. They return to Colorado, where upon discovering how Judith betrayed her, Tacey plans to open a rowdy new saloon, right across the street from the Judith/Clint home out of spite. During a quarrel, a drunken Judith throws a lantern at Clint and sets their house ablaze. ( note they live in the "Herman Munster" house and ride by the "Beaver Cleaver" house too). She perishes in the fire. Taceys saloon catches fire as well and burns to the ground. Tacey, the children and Clint vow to carry on and rebuild their lives.
