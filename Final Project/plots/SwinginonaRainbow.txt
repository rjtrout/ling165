At a radio station run by Thomas Marsden, a songwriter, Jimmy Rhodes, skips town without fulfilling a contractual obligation, so amateur songstress Lynn Bird is hired to replace him, Marsden mistakenly believing her to be Rhodess partner. Bird composes and writes a few songs, with help from Marsdens assistant, Chester Willoughby, and her success helps save the station.
