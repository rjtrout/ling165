Samantha MacKenzie (Katie Holmes) is the only daughter of United States president John MacKenzie (Michael Keaton). Because of her fathers political career, she has been in the public eye her entire life and spent most of her high school years in the White House. Having to deal with lack of privacy and public scrutiny for the most ridiculous things, Samantha has had a sheltered existence and her father has trouble letting her have more freedom yet is too busy to spend time with her. Though her mother Melanie is supportive, she still stands by her husbands decisions, leaving Samantha feeling restricted from having a normal life. Accompanied by Secret Service agents everywhere she goes, Samantha finally believes she has the chance to break out of her cocoon when she is given the opportunity to attend college in California. In California, Samantha ends up sharing a dorm with boy-crazed Mia Thompson, who finds it difficult when Samantha steals her spotlight, and they form a begrudging partnership. She becomes interested in James Lansome, a college student and Sams student advisor, since he does not treat her differently because of her father. Unknown to Sam, James is actually a Secret Service agent posing as a residential advisor in order to watch over her.
