As a cover for his true government mission, British intelligence agent Leo Marzell (Leo Carrillo) sponsors a scientific expedition led by Dr. David Lynd (Don Terry) to find a source for a wonder drug in the jungles of the South Pacific. When Lynd agrees to the expedition over the objections of his aviator fianc√©e Jane Claymore (Louise Allbritton), she breaks the engagement but secretly follows him to the island. Claymore attempts to halt Lynds expedition so they can be married, but makes the mistake of recruiting Axis espionage agent Zambesi (Edgar Barrier) to help her. Native islander Tagani (Turhan Bey) is sent by Zambesi to murder Lynd, and sets loose a tiger that injures Marzell. Most of Lynds guides are attacked by crocodiles, but one survives to kill Tagani. Claymore ends up saving Marzall, Lynd and the remainder of the expedition by contacting the Royal Air Force which sends a rescue squad.
