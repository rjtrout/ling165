Yvette Mimieux plays the chief executive of a giant corporation called "Mystique", but the organization is also known as "Executive Development Training", or EDT. Christopher Allport plays Jack Nilsson, a decent all-American young executive. Top management executives are required to spend a weekend with Bianca Ray at a hotel, where they are put under psychological pressure. As a prerequisite to the training course, participants must sign a waiver giving the company the release to physically and psychologically abuse the individuals in the course. The participants struggle with their shortcomings, such as obesity and alcoholism. Another individual is a closet homosexual, and a fourth is a transvestite. At one point in the film, the obese trainee is forced to eat trash and discarded food in front of the other seminar participants. Eventually, the seminar executives and their wives lose their inhibitions later on in the "consciousness-raising" coursework.
