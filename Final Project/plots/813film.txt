As summarized in a film publication, Robert Castleback (Lewis) has plans for worldwide power through a mysterious secret that he possesses. Arsene Lupin (Nowell), master thief but loyal Frenchman, knows of the secret and is attempting to obtain state papers held by Castleback. Two other persons in the employ of the Kaiser are attempting the same thing. Castleback is murdered and some suspect Lupin, who announces his intention to catch the real killer. Disguised as the chief of police, he works fearlessly alongside the police. Soon he comes into contact with another master criminal, Ribeira (Beery), who is mascarading as Maj. Parbury, and Lupin suspects that he is complicit in the crime. Lupin falls in love with Dolores Castleback (Adams), widow of the murdered man. When Ribeira, to get rid of Lupin, steals his daughter and informs Lupin that he will have to go alone to a deserted house to get her back, Lupin goes, foils the plot to kill him, and escapes through an underground tunnel that comes out in the home of Delores. As he turns from the mantelpiece where he has discovered the hiding place of the state papers, he sees a mysterious man that he has been trailing. To Lupins horror he finds that the man is really Delores, who is in reality a German criminal. She kills herself and Lupin escapes.
