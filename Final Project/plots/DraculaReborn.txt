In Los Angeles, California, realtor Jonathan Harker (Corey Landis) proposes the sale of an abandoned building in a gang-dominated neighborhood for $12.5 million to his wealthy client Vladimir Sarkany - who is actually the vampire Count Dracula (Stuart Rigby). The sale make Jonathan enough money to start a family with his wife, Lina (Victoria Summer). The night that Jonathan visits Dracula at his home to have the property deed signed, he notices a painted picture reminiscent of Lina. Later, Quincy Morris (Krash Miller) warns him about Dracula, who murdered his girlfriend, Lucy Spencer (Linda Bella). Police detectives, Holmwood (Preston James Hillier) and Varna (Charlie Garcia) investigate Lucys disappearance. Draculas associate, Renfield (Ian Pfister), frames Quincy for her murder. Jonathan takes Lina to see the painting at Draculas home, where Dracula begins to hypnotically seduce Lina, who reminds him of Lucy. Jonathan and Lina head back home, but their car breaks down on the way, causing them to camp in the woods. During the night, Dracula seduces the detectives and goes to bite Lina, sparking her illness. At dawn, the car is able to start back up and Jonathan takes Lina to get blood work done by Dr. Joan Seward (Dani Lennon). The following day, the detectives discover Lucys corpse in a trunk. Jonathan finds out Lina is infected with an anonymous organism that is multiplying inside her system. While on the run, Quincy pleas to Jonathan for help to kill Dracula, although Jonathan refuses to believe Dracula is a vampire. Shortly after, Renfield runs Quincy over with a truck, killing him. When Lina begins feasting on their dogs corpse, Jonathan gets in contact with vampire hunter, Van Helsing (Keith Reay) for help and learns Quincy was killed. After Dracula seduces Lina and takes her away, Jonathan learns from Van Helsing and a mythical book that they have one day to rescue Lina and kill Dracula, or Lina will turn into a vampire. Jonathan confronts Dracula at his house, but Dracula wards him off. Jonathan hallucinates that he sees Lina on the road and crashes his car, but survives. The next day, the detectives come to arrest Jonathan for his wifeâ€™s murder, and Helsing kills them. Jonathan and Helsing confront Dracula at his new house, which is about to go into closure. They find Dracula resting inside a coffin, and Helsing tries to kill him while Jonathan takes Lina upstairs. Dracula escapes and kills Helsing. He suddenly appears in front of Jonathan and attacks him; however, Jonathan and Lina kill him by driving a stake through his heart. Afterwards, Lina bites and presumably kills Jonathan, revealing she has become a vampire. Lina takes over Draculas home, with Renfield as her assistant.
