After retrieving a mysterious parcel for his ex-wife, eccentric down-on-his-luck artist Harry Berg (Keaton) enlists the help of private eye Rachel Dobs (Chong) when he suddenly becomes embroiled with thugs and a murder investigation. The combination of Harrys many comic eccentricities and Rachels straight-and-narrow, naive personality ends up working in their favor to help solve the crime.
