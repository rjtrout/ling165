Roger Bradley (OConnor) is the son of the owner of a milk company. He wants to get a job as a milkman at his fathers company, but his father denies it because of Rogers after-war trauma: when he gets stressed or frustrated, he quacks like a duck. Roger gets upset at his father and does not see any problem with the quacking. In revenge, he gets a job with his fathers arch-rival, Breezy Albright (Durante) at another milk company. He becomes very successful and quickly falls in love with the bosss daughter, Chris Abbott (Laurie).
