Factory worker Judy Wingate financially supports her stepmother Frances, who is keeping company with Eddie Nolan, a gangster. Eddie makes a pass at Judy, who knocks him cold with a skillet. A furious Frances finds Eddie recovering, strikes him again and kills him. But it is Judy who is arrested, convicted and sent to prison for five years. A reporter covering the trial, Dan Donahue, develops a romantic attraction to Judy, who finds prison bearable, at least being far from her wicked stepmother. A guilty conscience persuades Frances, however, to offer $10,000 from Judys life insurance policy to mobsters Gorno and Mullins to break her out of jail. All spirals downhill from there. Judy threatens to go to the police and tell all she knows. Mullins, angry with Frances, runs her down with a car. On her deathbed, Frances attempts to confess, but Gorno shoots her before she can speak. Donahue and the police, however, are able to get the better of the villains and clear Judys name once and for all.
