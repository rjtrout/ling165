Carmelita Lindsay believes shes finally going away on a honeymoon. Her husband Dennis secretly intends to use this ocean voyage to sell advertising to the well-to-do Baldwins, with help from his Uncle Matt and Aunt Delia. A quarrel results in Dennis being thrown out of his cabin by Carmelita and into one occupied by Fifi Russell, where the Baldwins spot him. Mistaken identities multiply thereafter, with Uncle Matt posing as a British lord and passenger Emily Pepper as his wife, "Lady Epping." By the time the boat is about to dock, Carmelita has nearly ended up married to a man named George Skinner before an alarm is set off, sending passengers scurrying overboard.
