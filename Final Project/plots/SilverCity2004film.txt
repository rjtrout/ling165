Richard "Dicky" Pilager, the dim-witted scion of a powerful political dynasty, is running for Governor of Colorado. One day, while filming a campaign ad that shows him fishing at Arapahoe Lake, Pilager hooks a corpse on location. Chuck Raven, Pilagers campaign manager, hires Danny OBrien, a former journalist who works as a private investigator, to examine the case. Raven urges OBrien to find potential links between the body and Pilagers political enemies. OBriens job is essentially to intimidate Pilagers opponents, and he has numerous revealing conversations with various people. He learns that business mogul Wes Benteen is using Pilager to promote his own agenda. The interviews also reveal further corruption: politicians, land developers, and mining companies are conspiring to ignore certain environmental issues. OBrien also learns about illegal migrant workers, as well as a potentially damaging love affair.
