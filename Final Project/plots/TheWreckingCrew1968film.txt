Matt Helm is assigned by his secret agency, ICE, to bring down an evil count named Contini, who is trying to collapse the world economy by stealing a billion dollars in gold. Helm travels to Denmark, where he is given a guide, Freya Carlson, a beautiful but bumbling woman from a Danish tourism bureau. A pair of Continis accomplices, the seductive Linka Karensky and Yu-Rang, each attempt to foil Helms plans. The former is killed in an ambush intended for Helm, the latter in an explosion. On each occasion, Freyas clumsy attempts to assist Matt are helpful, but not particularly appreciated. McDonald, his chief at ICE, turns up to aid Helm, but is wounded in action. McDonald confides to Helm that the seemingly inept Freya is actually a top secret British agent herself, using a clever guise. They go to Continis chateau for a showdown, and Helm creates chaos and destruction with a variety of unique gadgets. Contini escapes with the gold on a train bound for Luxembourg, but with a minihelicopter, Helm and Freya are able to catch up to him. Freya almost gets killed by Contini, but Matt rescues her, then kills Contini when Helm throws him through a trap door onto the tracks. Successful and alone at last, Helm finally has an opportunity to thank an appreciative Freya as only he can.
