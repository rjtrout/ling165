For a new film to be shot in New Orleans, after his leading lady drops out, studio head James Manning seeks an unknown actress to be his new star. He finds four leading candidates and employs aspiring director Mike Snowden to conduct their screen tests. The young women come from all walks of life. Kathy Conway is a Minnesota girl who agrees to try acting simply to please her mother. Ina Schiller is from Vienna, where she was recently widowed. Vicki Dauray comes from Paris, where she leaves behind a husband and child. Maria Antonelli is a beauty from Italy whose talent is mainly in alluring men. Kathy takes a personal interest in Mike, but is disappointed when he leaves a party with Ina instead. Handsome actor Tom Grant is interested in Vicki and publicist Ted Larabee promotes her, neither aware that she is a married woman. Ina is introduced to Mikes moody friend Johnny Pryor, a music composer, while Marie is seduced by Spencer Farrington, Jr., a playboy who owns a hotel. Kathys mother turns up and expects everyone to recognize her daughter as a future star. Kathy fails the screen test, however, but realizes Mike wants to pursue a personal relationship with her. The original actress changes her mind and takes back the film role, but Ina and Maria are offered movie contracts by the studio and marriage contracts with their new suitors. Vicki is not disappointed, realizing that her family comes first.
