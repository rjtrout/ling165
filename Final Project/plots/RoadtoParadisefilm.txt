Loretta Young plays the part of an orphan who has been raised by two thieves (Raymond Hatton and George Barraud) and does not know that she has a twin sister who is now a wealthy socialite (Loretta Young as Margaret Waring). One day, while she is dining at a Chinese restaurant with her two guardians, they notice the wealthy socialite and are taken aback at how closely she resembles Young. Hatton and Barraud convince Young that she should impersonate the socialite so that they can enter her house and steal the contents of her safe. Young enters the house and meet Jack Mulhall who senses something different about Waring and immediately falls in love with Young. When night falls, Young lets Hatton and Barraud into the house and they attempt to open the safe. Waring happens to enter the house and is shocked to find a woman that looks like her. She is wounded by Barraud and Young tricks the police into thinking that Waring is an imposter and thief. Even though Mulhall knows the truth, he keeps quiet because he is in love with Young. Eventually Young discovers that Waring is her twin sister when they discover that they have matching lockets. The charges against Waring are dropped and Young accepts Mulhalls proposal of marriage.
