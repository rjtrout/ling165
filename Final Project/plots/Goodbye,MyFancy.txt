Powerful U.S. Representative Agatha Reed (Joan Crawford) returns to her alma mater to receive an honorary degree. Unbeknownst to the colleges board of trustees, Agatha was expelled from the school years earlier for participating in an all-night date with a young professor, Dr. James Merrill (Robert Young), who is now the university president. The romantic fires are rekindled when the two meet. Matt Cole (Frank Lovejoy), a photographer from Life Magazine who loves Agatha, believes her feeling for Merrill is simply an unresolved holdover from her girlhood and follows her to the school. Agatha becomes embroiled in a university matter over progressive teaching methods with Dr. Pitt (Morgan Farley), board trustee Claude Griswold (Howard St. John) and his wife Ellen Griswold (Lurene Tuttle). A film Agatha made about the dangers of restricting intellectual freedom is to be shown on campus to celebrate her legacy, but the reactionary Griswold forces Merrill to cancel the showing. Merrill will not stand up to Griswold, and though Merrill consents to show the film if Agathas expulsion is not revealed, he lies to his daughter about the reason why. After a series of misunderstandings, Agatha realizes she belongs with Cole and should forget the way she fancied Merrill.
