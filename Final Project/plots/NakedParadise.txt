His passengers include Zac Cotton, alcoholic girlfriend Max McKenzie and a pair of thugs, Mitch and Stony, who following a luau, without Dukes knowledge, rob a plantation of its payroll. The gang intends to continue on to another island in the South Pacific, but tempers flare after Max is struck by Zac, which causes Duke to quit, demanding payment. As he is about to set sail, Max asks to go with him, determined to change her life. A hurricane hits, however, forcing Duke to turn back. On arrival, he is beaten unconscious by Mitch and Stony while the woman is roughed up by Zac. Zac intends to make off with Dukes schooner and takes a local girl, Lanai, as a hostage, shooting Stony, who objects to this. A fight ensues in which Duke triumphs after Zac is killed by the boats propeller. Duke and Max sail away.
