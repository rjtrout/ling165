Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus narrates a flashback of a football match between France and China. French coach Yves Gluant enters the stadium, wearing the Pink Panther diamond ring, which is seen by his team as a symbol of pride and victory. He kisses his girlfriend, pop star Xania, and whispers something to her. After France wins the game in sudden death, Gluant is killed by a poison dart, with the Pink Panther diamond nowhere to be found. Eager to win the Medal of Honour, Dreyfus promotes a clumsy small-town policeman and "village idiot", Jacques Clouseau, to the rank of Inspector and assigns him to the Pink Panther case. Dreyfus simultaneously assembles a secret team of top investigators to crack the case, allowing Clouseau to serve as the public face of the investigation and draw all the media attention. Dreyfus assigns Gilbert Ponton to be Clouseaus assistant, instructing him to keep him informed of Clouseaus actions. Despite his orders, Ponton quickly befriends Clouseau, as Clouseau attempts to solve the case by looking for clues and interviewing people close to Gluant, though not without being clumsy and foolish during his work. All throughout this, Clouseau also works alongside secretary Nicole Durant, and starts to fall in love with her. Bizu, a French soccer player who had an affair with Xania and therefore is the prime suspect in Gluants murder, is shot in the head and killed in the teams changing room. While at a casino to gather information, Clouseau encounters British Agent 006, Nigel Boswell. Boswell foils a robbery at the casino by the "Gas Mask Bandits", using Clouseaus trench coat to hide his identity. Clouseau mistakenly receives credit for the deed and is subsequently nominated for the Légion dhonneur, much to Dreyfus dismay. Clouseau and Ponton follow Xania to New York City, suspecting that she knows more than she is telling. However, despite Pontons insistence that she is most likely a suspect because Gluant cheated on her, Clouseau decides Xania is innocent. While in New York, Clouseau and Ponton eat hamburgers, and Clouseau discovers his love for the sandwich, which he had assumed to be nothing more than "disgusting American food". Meanwhile, because the poison that killed Gluant was derived from Chinese herbs, Dreyfus concludes that the killer is a Chinese envoy named Dr. Pang. Ready to take charge of the case and win the Légion dhonneur, Dreyfus has one of his officers swap Clouseaus bag with one full of weapons at the airport. The bag sets off the metal detector at security control, causing the guards to be suspicious of Clouseau who is eventually arrested because of his inability to pronounce "hamburger" correctly (he tried to smuggle some for the flight home due to his personal dislike of in-flight meals). Upon his return to France, the press vilifies him and Dreyfus strips him of his rank of Inspector. Dreyfus now plots to publicly arrest Dr. Pang at the Presidential Ball, where Xania will also be performing. Clouseau returns home and happens to see an article about his arrest online. He deduces from the photograph in it that Gluant and Bizus assassin will target Xania next, and he phones Ponton and Nicole. The trio hurry to the Élysée Palace and sneak into the Presidential Ball. While Dreyfus publicly arrests Dr. Pang for Gluants murder, Clouseau and Ponton save Xanias life by capturing her would-be assassin, Yuri, the coach of the football team. Jealous of Gluant and believing he shouldve taken credit for the football teams success instead of Gluant, Yuri used his knowledge of Chinese herbs, mandated by a soccer statute, to kill him. After overhearing Yuris rants, Bizu blackmailed him, so Yuri killed Bizu using Russian military tactics to target the latters occipital lobe. Yuri targeted Xania because she ignored him while she dated Gluant. Clouseau reveals the Pink Panther was not stolen but instead sewn into the lining of Xanias purse. He discovered this after the photograph of his arrest also showed an X-ray of the purse going through airport security. Xania confessed that she received it from Gluant as an engagement ring — he had whispered his proposal to her prior to the football match — but she hid this fact because she thought it could implicate her as the killer. Clouseau concludes that Xania is the rings rightful owner, while Yuri is taken into custody. For successfully solving the case, Clouseau wins the Légion dhonneur. While leaving the ceremony with Ponton, Clouseau gets Dreyfus suit caught in his car door; he remains oblivious to Dreyfus screams as he drives away. Clouseau, Ponton and Nicole later visit him in the hospital. After Clouseau wishes him well, he accidentally releases the brake on Dreyfus bed; the bed races through the hospital corridors and throws Dreyfus into the Seine, and he shouts Clouseaus name in anger as he is plunged into the river.
