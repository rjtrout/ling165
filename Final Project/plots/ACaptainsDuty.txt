Phillips was a mariner of 30 years experience when his ship was taken. He took extensive security precautions to keep his crew safe and hidden, leaving himself as the only possible hostage. This led to an ordeal of several days in a lifeboat in the hands of pirates, whom Phillips portrays as alternately conciliatory, vicious, and unfocused. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy assembled a large task force, and tensions steadily rose, as did Phillipsâ€™ fear for his life. The book details Phillips attempted escape and eventual rescue by U.S. Navy SEALs, and portrays Phillips wife Andrea as loyal and strong-willed.
