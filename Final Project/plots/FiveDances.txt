Chip, a young dancer who recently arrived in New York City, starts to train and practice with three other dancers and the ballet master; the dancing room where they practice is in SoHo. While patiently rehearsing each figure of the five dances making up the ballet, Chip has to choose between going back to his family home in the Midwest and starting his own career and personal life.
