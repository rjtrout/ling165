Thanks to his mothers help, Arthur Tate somehow makes a remarkable rise from a lowly constable to the ruler of a South America country. His story begins with Inspector Hobarts investigation into dressmaker Violet Lawsons missing husband. Hobart suspects foul play and digs up Violets cellar, looking for the body. Violet did indeed kill her spouse, but doesnt bury the corpse there until after Hobart has dug the hole. A helpful tip from Arthurs mum makes him the hero who solves the case. Baron von Lukenberg is then arrested for creating a species of deadly spiders. But it is actually his wife, the Baroness, who is responsible. Arthur, with his mums aid, once again saves the day. President Esteda of the South American nation of Guanduria is so favorably impressed, he hires Arthur to be his personal liaison. Marigold Marado turns up, telling Arthur she wants to make a film about his heroism. What he doesnt know is that Marigold is a revolutionary who hopes to overthrow Estedas government. The film she ends up creating inadvertently turns Arthur into a great revolutionary hero, and it is he who becomes Guandurias new leader. Arthur can do no wrong. The Earl of Aldershot learns of his great deeds and leaves Arthur the grand sum of 15 million pounds in his will. Arthur goes back to England to the Earls mansion to collect, intending to give all the money away to charity, but leaving it to his mother in case of his death. She blows up the mansion with her son in it.
