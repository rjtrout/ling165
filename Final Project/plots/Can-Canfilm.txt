In the Montmartre district of Paris, a dance known as the can-can, considered lewd, is performed nightly at the Bal du Paradis, a cabaret where Simone Pistache is both a dancer and the proprietor. On a night when her lawyer and lover, François Durnais, brings his good friend, Chief Magistrate Paul Barrière, to the club, a raid is staged by police and the performers, including Simone, are placed under arrest. Paul wishes the charges to be dismissed, but his younger colleague Philippe Forrestier believes the laws against public indecency should be enforced. Visiting the cabaret and pretending to be someone else, Philippe becomes better acquainted with Simone and develops a romantic interest in her, but she is warned by dancer Claudine that he is actually a judge. Despite his attraction to her, Philippe arranges for Simone to be arrested once more. François again defends her in court and Philippe is persuaded to drop all the charges. He then shocks Simone by proposing marriage to her. She goes to François, warning him that she will accept the proposal if he does not marry her himself. Paul, meanwhile, tries to talk Philippe out of it, believing such an arrangement would end his career. Simone obtains a loan from François to stage a ball, insisting he accept a deed to the cabaret as collateral. The police come this time and take François away instead of her. Simone writes a letter to Philippe, saying she cannot in good conscience become his bride. A can-can is performed to the approval of all, agreeing that it is not in any way obscene. When the police nonetheless escort Simone to a wagon used for prisoners, she is startled to find François inside, and even more surprised when he finally proposes.
