Bloodsport III reintroduces the character Alex Cardo (Daniel Bernhardt) from Bloodsport II. As Alex travels to India and gambles in a casino, masked men steal money and a package from the casino, but not before Alex beats up several of the men. After the robbery, the casino owner convinces Alex to retrieve the package (a bag of diamonds) from the robbers, since they belong to a mob boss named Duvalier (John Rhys-Davies). Alex does so, and Duvalier invites him to a dinner party hes hosting as thanks. At the party, Duvalier shows Alex his top fighter, the Beast, and tries to convince Alex to fight in his upcoming Kumite. Alex refuses, since he does not fight for profit, much to Duvaliers ire. To provoke him into fighting, Duvalier has Sun (James Hong), Alexs mentor, teacher, and spiritual "father", killed. Alex turns to Leung (Pat Morita) to whom he was indebted in Bloodsport II: The Next Kumite. Leung directs him to the great shaman, Makato "the Judge", to whom Alex must turn for guidance. (The Judge is Suns brother who developed his own variation of Suns Iron Hand technique). The judge teaches him to fully channel the energy in his mind and body in order to rout the Beast in the Kumite. By this point however, Duvalier has invested everything in the Beast, and no longer wants Alex in his Kumite, for fear he will upset the odds. When he is unable to block Alexs entry, he has his men stationed at the entrances to the tournament arena. Alex gets round this by posing as one of the entourage of another fighter. Both Alex and the Beast make their way through the Kumite, and face each other in the finals. Alex is initially outmatched by the Beasts great physical strength and endurance, and takes a severe beating as a result. Eventually, he remembers his training, and is able to knock out the Beast. He refrains from killing Duvalier, knowing that it wont bring Sun back.
