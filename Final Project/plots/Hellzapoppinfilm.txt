Shemp Howard begins the film as the projectionist of a cinema, displaying on its screen what appears to be the start of a song-and-dance number whose classily dressed performers walk down a staircase - which collapses as in a fun-house ride, sliding them all straight to hell, where they are tortured by demons. Ole and Chic arrive in the midst of the mayhem by taxi, and after a bit of funny business step back to reveal that its a movie sound stage. They work for Miracle Pictures, a company using the slogan "If its a good picture, its a Miracle!" A mousy screenwriter (Elisha Cook, Jr.) outlines his script for the screen adaptation of Hellzapoppin, and the rest of the movie depicts Cooks script. Among the topical humor is Johnson picking up a sled named "Rosebud" and saying "I thought theyd burnt that" (Olsen and Johnson were friends of Orson Welles, whose film Citizen Kane closes with Charles Foster Kanes childhood sled being burnt). The film has a frenetic pace, and often breaks the Fourth wall, including inner fourth walls introduced by its nonlinear, metafictional narrative.
