Stanley White (Rourke) is a decorated racist police captain and Vietnam War veteran assigned to New York Citys Chinatown, where he makes it his personal mission to come down hard on Chinese organized crime. White comes into conflict with Joey Tai (Lone), a young man who ruthlessly rises to become the head of the Chinese triad societies, and as a result of his ambition, creates a high profile for himself and the triads activities. Together, they end the uneasy truce that has existed between the triads and the police precinct, even as they conduct a personal war between themselves. The married captain also becomes romantically involved with Tracy Tzu (Ariane), a television reporter, who comes under brutal attack from the criminals, as does Whites long-suffering wife. This makes him even more determined to destroy the triads, and especially Joey Tai. White also hires an up-and-coming Chinese rookie cop, Herbert, to go undercover as one of Tais restaurant workers. Herbert manages to get inside information on a drug shipment but is betrayed by corrupt cop Alan Perez and loses his life when Tai is informed by Perez that Herberts a cop. Now that Tai has raped Tracy, killed his wife and Herbert, White wastes no time in confronting Tai just as the shipment comes in. At the harbor, Tai and his bodyguard are on their way to the shipment when White attempts to arrest them. Perez drives by yelling abuse, White shoots and kills Perez but Tai draws a gun and shoots White in the hand accidentally killing his bodyguard. Tai flees on a train bridge. That leads to a showdown where White and Tai run at each other while shooting bullets recklessly. White shoots Tai leaving him wounded. Rather than suffer, Tai asks for Whites gun to die in front of him.
