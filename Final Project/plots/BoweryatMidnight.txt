Lugosis character uses his soup kitchen as a means to recruit members of a criminal gang, of which he is also secretly the head.

Lugosis character meets his demise when the doctor leads the unwitting Lugosi into a basement room where the reanimated corpses attack him. Towards the end of the film, the male lead, played by John Archer, appears to be killed and mysteriously reanimated, in which state his girlfriend sees him. Then, in the films final scene, he appears restored to his former health, and not like a zombie at all, and is about to (or already has) marry his girlfriend. In one scene, with two policemen talking outside a cinema, a movie poster outside the cinema entrance behind them advertises Bela Lugosi in The Corpse Vanishes, another Lugosi horror film also released in 1942.
