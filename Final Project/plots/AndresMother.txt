The play is set at the Manhattan memorial service for Andre Gerard, who died of AIDS and was buried in Dallas several weeks earlier. Andres mother Katharine cannot come to terms with his death or share her grief with Cal, Andres lover. Her rage is directed not only at the man she never accepted and her own mother, who was less judgmental of her grandsons life, but at Andre himself as well.
