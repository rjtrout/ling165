Winnie is the head of a health clinic and has Jojo (played by Joe E. Brown) as one of her employees. Jojo is a wrestler forced to enter the ring and face down a musclebound masked opponent Olaf (played by Frank Hagney). Making matters worse, the masked marauder is convinced his wife has been fooling around with JoJo. JoJo is knocked out early in the proceedings, whereupon he dreams he is a sultan surrounded by harem girls. A romantic subplot involves Tom (played by Paul Gregory) and Sally (played by Claudia Dell). Tom works for Sallys father. Sally asks her father to give Tom a promotion so she can spend more time with him. When Tom refuses to be promoted without earning the position, she threatens to have him fired and he quits his job. Tom attempts to begin a new career as a championship wrestler and is trained by Winnie and Jojo. When Sally learns about this, she attempts to stop him and asks for his forgiveness. She pleads with him to not fight but he has already pledged to do so.
