Private Adrian, a young United States Marine Corps Vietnam war era draftee who, despite being an anti-war hippie, reluctantly reports to boot camp to fulfill his duty as an American. Adrian excels as a leader; though, his pacifist ideology presents continuing conflicts between himself and his superiors. Adrians drill instructor, Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Drake quickly recognizes Adrians leadership qualities, but is conflicted as he grows to respect Adrian while also realizing that he represents everything Adrian opposes. At one point, Adrian points out that his love of meditation is similar to Drakes drawing to relax, indicating a sketch of a flying bird. Both are ways of finding freedom. Drake responds angrily, denying that he had drawn the picture. Throughout the training, the Chief Drill Instructor, and Drakes superior, Master Sgt. Frank DePayster, takes an instant dislike to Adrian. He repeatedly argues with Drake about him, claiming that the fact that the man is performing all of his assigned tasks is not enough. He considers Adrians attitude grounds enough for him to be set back and placed in the Motivational Platoon, a disciplinary unit for problem recruits. Drake disagrees and allows Adrian to continue training through to graduation, at one point personally bringing him back after he deserted. However, DePayster had gone behind Drakes back by filing a complaint against them both with the Company Commanding Officer. Without Drakes approval, the CO removed Adrian, placing him in the Motivational Platoon under DePayster. Drake accuses DePayster of carrying out a personal vendetta, to which DePayster replies "Ill forget I heard that." Drake takes the drawing of the bird from his desk drawer and hangs it up, thus signifying his own method of rebellion and freedom. The platoon graduates without Adrian. As Drake awaits a new batch of recruits, DePayster informs him that Adrian went "over the hill" during the night.
