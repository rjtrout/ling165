Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong play versions of themselves being invited to Amsterdam for a film festival devoted to Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton. After initially assuming that Cheech was Reynolds, the promoter soon finds out that neither Reynolds nor Parton will appear, forcing the festival to be canceled. In need of a replacement act, he goes to Cheech and Chong for help and the duo, which has not performed live on stage in several years, happily volunteers to give a live performance. For much of the film, they do versions of many of their recorded characters (with the exception of Pedro and the Man, whom they had already portrayed on film in Up in Smoke) and several new skits. As most of the sketches featured did not directly fit into the narrative, they are instead presented as cutaways. The final act of the movie features their live performance, climaxing with a version of the "Ralph And Herbie" routine.
