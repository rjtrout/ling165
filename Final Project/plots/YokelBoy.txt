Hollywood studio boss R. B. Harris is desperate for a box-office hit. Reading about a young man in Kansas who has gained a reputation as the movies number one fan, Harris summons him, Joe Ruddy, to ask his advice about a new gangster story. Joe suggests hiring a real gangster. Joe goes to Chicago to see the notorious "Buggsy" Malone, first trying a nightclub where Buggsies sister Molly is the featured singer. Molly manages to coax her brother into doing the movie, eager to get him to give up his criminal ways and even hiding a million dollars of his cash until he turns over a new leaf. On the movie set, leading lady Vera Valaize is irate about the casting and Buggsies rewriting of the scenes, so she walks off. Molly is asked by her brother to take over the part. During a bank robbery scene shot on location, a couple of Buggsies cronies hatch a scheme to actually rob the bank. By the time Buggsie straightens everything out, he finds out Mollys fallen in love with Joe and arranges their wedding on the way home.
