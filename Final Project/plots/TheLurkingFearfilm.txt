Ex-con John Martense (Blake Adams) returns to his childhood home of Lefferts Corner after serving time for a crime he didnt commit. Martense visits family friend Knaggs (Vincent Schiavelli), a mortician who has been holding half of a map for him. The map leads to a graveyard where Martenses father hid the money from his last heist. Arriving at an abandoned church, Martense is confronted by Cathryn (Ashley Laurence), a young woman seeking revenge for the murder of her sister, and town doctor Dr. Haggis (Jeffrey Combs). This group is quickly joined by a trio of criminals who are looking to find the money Johns father stole from them. What everyone is not aware of are the humanoid creatures lurking underneath the holy grounds.
