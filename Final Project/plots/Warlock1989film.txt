The Warlock is taken captive in Boston, Massachusetts in 1691 by the witch-hunter Giles Redferne. He is sentenced to death for his activities, including the bewitching of Redfernes bride-to-be; but, before the execution, Satan appears and propels the Warlock forward in time to 20th century Los Angeles, California. Redferne follows through the portal. The Warlock attempts to assemble The Grand Grimoire, a Satanic book that will reveal the "true" name of God and thus allow him to unmake all of creation. Redferne and the Warlock then embark on a cat-and-mouse chase with the Grand Grimoire and Kassandra, a waitress who encounters Giles attempting to use a "witch compass" to track the Warlock. Explaining some basic rules of the Warlock, such as their weakness to purified salt, Kassandra follows Giles, as the Warlock has cursed her with an aging spell. The Warlock assembles two-thirds of the Grimoire; and Giles is stunned to learn that the last portion is buried in his grave, buried off of church lands under the cursed sign of a witch. The Warlock appears and starts a ritual to assemble the Grimoire. After seeing the name of God appear on the book, The Warlock is about to call it out and unmake existence when Kassandra injects him with salt water, and he bursts into flame. Redferne returns to his own time. In the epilogue, Kassandra is seen burying the Grimoire in the Bonneville Salt Flats.
