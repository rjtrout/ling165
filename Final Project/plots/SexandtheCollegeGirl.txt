This is a "slice-of-life" film set primarily around a Puerto Rican luxury hotel frequented by young East Coast weekenders. Not the most enthralling drama (as life itself tends not to be), nor a sexually explicit one in relation to ordinary films today; but still, it has some subtle merit because of its intentionally typical segments.
