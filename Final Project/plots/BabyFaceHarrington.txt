Millicent (Una Merkel) wants her husband Willie (Charles Butterworth) to make a success of himself, the way her old beau Ronald (Harvey Stephens) did. In the belief what she wants most is money, Willie cashes in a life-insurance policy in exchange for $2,000 in cash, which he promptly loses. When he sees real-estate agent Skinner (Donald Meek) with that much money, not long after having spoken with him, Willie knows whos robbed him. Meanwhile, a professional thief, Rocky Banister (Nat Pendleton), is terrifying everyone in town with his daring robberies, worrying Millicent so much that she keeps a gun nearby. Borrowing the gun, Willie confronts Skinner and takes the $2,000. When he returns home, Willie discovers that his money has been in his wallet all along. Before he can return it to Skinner and apologize, Rocky breaks in and steals all $4,000. Willie is accused of being an accomplice of Rockys and sent to jail. During a breakout, Willie manages to leave a note behind for the police, who catch up just in time to apprehend Rocky and proclaim Willie a hero.
