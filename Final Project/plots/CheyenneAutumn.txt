In 1878, Chiefs Little Wolf (Ricardo Montalbán) and Dull Knife (Gilbert Roland) led over three hundred starved and weary Cheyenne Indians from their reservation in the Oklahoma Territory to their former traditional home in Wyoming. The U.S. government sees this as an act of rebellion, and the sympathetic Captain Thomas Archer (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Army is forced to lead his troops in an attempt to stop the tribe. As the press misrepresents the natives motives and goals for their trek as malicious, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz (Edward G. Robinson) tries to prevent violence from erupting between the Army and the natives. Also featured are James Stewart as Marshal Wyatt Earp, Dolores del Río as "Spanish Woman", and Carroll Baker as a pacifist Quaker school teacher and Archers love interest.
