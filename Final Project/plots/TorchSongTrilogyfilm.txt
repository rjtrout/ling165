1971: Arnold (Harvey Fierstein), a New York City female impersonator, meets Ed (Brian Kerwin), a bisexual schoolteacher, and they fall in love. Ed, however, is uncomfortable with his sexuality and he leaves Arnold for a girlfriend, Laurel. 1973-79: During Christmas, Arnold meets the love of his life, a male model named Alan (Matthew Broderick). They settle down together, later spending a weekend with Ed and Laurel in the country, where their relationship is tested but endures. Eventually, they apply to foster a child together with a view to adoption, and their application is eventually successful and so they move to a bigger apartment. However, on their first night at their new home, Alan is killed in a homophobic attack. 1980: Months later, in the spring of 1980, Arnolds mother (Anne Bancroft) comes to visit from Florida, but her visit leads to a long-overdue confrontation. Arnolds mother disapproves of Arnolds homosexuality and his planned adoption of a gay teenage son, David (Eddie Castrodad), as well as Arnolds use of their family burial plot for Alan. They have a series of arguments where Arnold demands that she accept him for who he is, insisting that if she cant then she has no place in his life. The following morning, before she returns to Florida, they have a conversation where, for the first time, they seem to understand each other. With both David and Ed (who is now more mature and settled) in his life, and a successful new career creating his own stage revue, Arnolds life is finally complete.
