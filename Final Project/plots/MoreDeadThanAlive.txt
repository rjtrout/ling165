A murderer named Cain (Clint Walker) is released from prison after 18 years and wants to settle down as a rancher without ever having to touch a gun again. But no one will give him a job and people are after him for his earlier crimes. He finally takes an offer from a showman named Ruffalo (Vincent Price) to perform as "Killer Cain" in his traveling shooting show. However, after 18 years without practice, Cain is not as good as he once was with a gun. Cain tries to find redemption and peace when he falls in love with Monica Alton (Anne Francis), an artist from the east who came out west to paint. Yet Cains reputation continues to dog him as past enemies (Mike Henry) try to settle old scores and a young gunslinger (Paul Hampton) looking to make his reputation by killing Cain.
