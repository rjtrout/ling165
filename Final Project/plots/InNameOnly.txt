Alec Walker (Cary Grant) puts up with a loveless marriage to Maida (Kay Francis) until he meets widow Julie Eden (Carole Lombard). They fall in love and he asks his wife for a divorce. She refuses; as she goes on to tell him, she married him solely for his social position and wealth and wont give them up. She is such a skillful liar that she has Alecs parents (Charles Coburn, Nella Walker) convinced that Julie is out to destroy the marriage. Julie breaks up with Alec since she cannot see any future with him. On Christmas Eve, a distraught Alec gets drunk, falls asleep in front of an open window, and becomes deathly ill. At the hospital, Dr. Muller (Maurice Moscovitch) tells Julie and Alecs father that the patient is likely to recover if he has the will to live. Julie lies to Alec, telling him that Maida will let him go. When Maida shows up and tries to see Alec, Julie blocks her. With no one else in the room, Maida freely admits she gave up the man she really loved for Alecs position and his fathers wealth. However, Alecs parents enter behind her and overhear her cold-blooded admission. Maidas plotting exposed, the path to Alec and Julies happiness is now clear.
