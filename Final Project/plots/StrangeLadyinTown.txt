1880: Dr. Julia Garth, traveling from Boston, arrives near Santa Fe, New Mexico, where her brother David is a U.S. Cavalry lieutenant. She soon meets the towns respected physician, Dr. Rourke OBrien, as well as Father Gabriel Mendoza, who has helped establish a new hospital. Spurs OBrien, the tomboy niece of the doctor, has a crush on David. She helps Julia buy a horse and teaches her to ride. Julia begins seeing patients, including a boy having vision problems and a toothache sufferer Billy the Kid has brought to her, but encounters resistance from Dr. OBrien, who doesnt believe women should be practicing medicine. David shoots a man who accuses him of cheating at cards, pleading self-defense. Dr. OBrien cant help but admire and be attracted to Julia, but she declines his marriage proposal, citing prejudices like his toward women as the reason she left Boston in the first place. He is irritated again when Julia gives medical advice to his most distinguished patient, New Mexicos governor, General Lew Wallace. At a party, David strikes an Army captain who accuses him of cheating and rustling. David admits to Julia that the charges are true, then robs a bank and rides off. Julia and Spurs manage to talk David into surrendering, whereupon he is shot. Julia elects to leave New Mexico for good until Dr. OBrien speaks up on her behalf.
