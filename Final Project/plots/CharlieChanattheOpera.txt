Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) gets to watch a performance thats to die for. For seven years, opera star Gravelle (Boris Karloff) has been locked in an insane asylum, his identity a mystery - even to himself. But when his memory unexpectedly returns, he begins to recall that his wife and her lover tried to murder him - and now hes determined to make them face the music. Gravelle escapes from the asylum and makes his way to the San Marco opera house and begins hiding out in the various rooms and passageways. Soon, members of the opera company are being murdered one by one. Chan soon investigates the killings and despite the presence of Gravelle, there are other suspects who may be the real killer. They suspects, excluding Gravelle, include Lilli Rochelle, the opera companys prima donna who has been having a secret affair with Enrico Barelli, the baritone; Mr. Whitely, Madame Rochelles husband who has warned Barelli to stay away from his wife; Anita Barelli, the opera companys number two soprano who has learned of her husbands affair with Lilli Rochelle; and Phil Childers, the fianc√©e of Lillis unacknowledged daughter who has been refused permission to marry the daughter. Clues found by Chan to apprehend the killer include a torn newspaper, a charred note, a heel mark on a newspaper picture, and a bloodstained belt. Among the questions asked are who has been threatening Lilli Rochelles life, the mystery man in Barellis dressing room before he is murdered, and why does Chan insist that the opera be performed twice in one evening?
