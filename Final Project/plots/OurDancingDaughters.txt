"Dangerous Diana" Medford (Crawford) is outwardly flamboyant and popular but inwardly virtuous and idealistic, patronizing her parents by telling them not to stay out late. Her friend Ann chases boys for their money and is as amoral as her mother. Diana and Ann are both attracted to Ben Blaine (Brown). He takes Dianas flirtatious behavior with other boys as a sign of lack of interest in him and marries Ann, who has lied about her virtues. Bea, a mutual friend of Diana and Ann, also meets and marries a wealthy suitor who loves her but is haunted by her past. Diana becomes distraught for a while about the marriage of her friends with questionable pasts. She decides to go away and Bea throws a party for her, which Ben declined to attend and made Ann decline as well. The same evening Ann hopes to meet up with her lover, Freddie, telling her husband she is going to see her sick mom. When her mom calls and Ben realizes Ann has lied to him yet again they get into an argument and Ann storms out to meet Freddie. Now alone, Ben decides to stop by the party where he and Diana realize their love for each other. Meanwhile, a drunk Ann follows Freddie into the party only to find Ben and Diana. She makes a drunken scene in which both Diana and Ben leave the party declaring their love but saying their goodbyes to each other. Beas husband comes home to find Bea trying to get a drunken Ann home. As Ann is mocking cleaning ladies and her life (as her mom did), she stumbles and falls to her death down a flight of stairs. Headlines show Diana returning home after a lengthy time away and she and Ben are free to unite.
