One day, Molly Standing (Margaret Schilling) is picking apples in her fathers apple orchard in California, with her friend Gertie (Marion Byron), when they meet two boys, Tommy Melville (Paul Gregory) and Gus Schultz (Tom Patricola). Molly falls in love with Tommy while Gertie falls in love with Gus. They plan a double wedding. Gerald Winters and his mother, who are wealthy art patrons, hear Molly singing, and, at Geralds suggestion, since he is very attracted to her, they sponsor her to study in Italy. Molly is reluctant to go but finally accepts when she discovers her father is in need of money. She leaves on the day that Tommy had hoped would be their wedding day. He says goodbye to her before attending Gertie and Guss wedding ceremony. Molly becomes a success in Rome. She returns to the United States to sing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, where she is again a great success. After the performance, Tommy attends the party which has been given by Gerald and his mother. Molly asks Tommy to sing, but her society friends do not think much of his singing. Realizing that Molly now lives in a world far apart from his, Tommy breaks off his engagement and returns to the orchards. Molly stays in New York for two years and then moves on to San Francisco for a concert stop. Although she is supposed to marry Gerald soon, she is unhappy. She goes to her fathers orchards to visit her old friend Gertie, to see how things are going with her. She happens to run into Tommy, and they rekindle their love and are married. Before they leave on their honeymoon, the doctor (Charles Winniger) informs Mollys manager and Tommy that Schilling has lost her voice and will never sing again, except perhaps, a lullaby.
