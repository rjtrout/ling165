Horse trainer Frankie Longworth discovers that his former sweetheart Christine is now married to jockey Steve Loomis. He seeks work, plus a chance to demonstrate his new "crouch" style of racing. Frankie ends up barred from racing after an ethical breach, and Steve is killed in a fall from a horse. After finding work with Sir Thomas Asbury, who wants to take him to England, the disgraced Frankie is able to gain back his license and rides Christines horse, Pride of Maryland, to victory.
