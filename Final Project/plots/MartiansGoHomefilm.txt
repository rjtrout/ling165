Quaid plays a songwriter who accidentally invites a billion Martians (all portrayed by stand-up comedians from the late eighties and early nineties) to planet Earth. These Martians become a nuisance to the planet by constantly playing practical jokes and refusing to allow anyone to get away with lying or deception of any kind.
