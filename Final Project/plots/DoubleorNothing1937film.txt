Eccentric millionaire philanthropist Axel Clark wishes to prove that all people are essentially honest and good. Following his death and as a provision of his will, his lawyers drop wallets on the streets of town that each have $100 in them, with information for contacting the lawyers. The four honest people who return the wallets then find themselves unexpectedly in a sort-of lottery. The first person who could double that sum within one month, through honest means, would inherit Clarks entire estate. Otherwise, the entire estate would go to Clarks greedy brother, who is determined to thwart the plan.
