When socialite Army Air Force pilot Oliver Bradford (Robert Young) is disfigured by war wounds, he hides from his family, including his mother (Spring Byington) and his fianc√©e (Hillary Brooke) and decides to live in seclusion in the seaside New England cottage he had rented from its current owner, Mrs. Minnett (Mildred Natwick), for his originally planned honeymoon. Laura Pennington (Dorothy McGuire) is a shy, homely maid who has hired on as the cottages caretaker. Oliver and Laura gradually fall in love and discover that their feelings for each other have mysteriously transformed them. He appears handsome to her and she seems beautiful to him. This "transformation" is perceived only by the two lovers (and the audience). Laura believes that the cottage is "enchanted" because it was once rented to honeymoon couples, and in time the widowed Mrs. Minnett reveals the true story behind the cottages enchantment legend.
