E. V. Marshall, known to all as "Marsh," works for wealthy real-estate businessman Ralph Nevins and is having a romantic affair with Ralphs unhappy wife, Paulie. He asks her to get a divorce, but Paulie grew up impoverished and refuses to do without her husbands money. One night they overhear thieves planning a jewelry robbery of the home of a doctor named Lynbury. They do not go to the police, concerned that Ralph might learn they were together. When she returns home later, however, Paulie is physically assaulted by her angry husband. Suspicious of her behavior, Ralph tells his secretary Kathy Stevens that hes planning to take his wife on a vacation and permit Marsh to run the company in his absence. Ralph then follows Paulie when she sees Marsh. Now willing to do anything to get away from her husband, Paulie pleads with Marsh to rob the jewels from the thieves as they leave Dr. Lynburys house. At the scene of the crime, where Marsh successfully steals the gems from the thieves who have robbed Dr. Lynburys home, Ralph catches Marsh and Paulie in the act and Paulie shoots him. Gunfire from the thieves makes Marsh believe they were the ones who shot Ralph. As the police investigate, Kathy discovers that Ralph has secretly made a recording, explaining his suspicions about his wife. Kathy is in love with Marsh, who decides to go to the police and confess. It turns out, meanwhile, that Dr. Lynbury has masterminded the burglary of his own home, looking to collect insurance money after having replaced his wifes jewels with worthless fakes. Police eventually place Lynbury under arrest and Paulie as well, with Marshs cooperation.
