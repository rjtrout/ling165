"The Cloth" of the title, on which the story centers, is a secret organization which the Roman Catholic Church forms to counteract the rising number of cases of demonic possessions across the country. The story follows a young man (Kyler Willett) who, though he is godless, is recruited into The Cloth to prepare a new generation with the tools needed to stop the rise of Beezlebub, the ultimate evil. The Cloth has found, much to the dismay of its members, that devout believers lack the capabililty for providing such tools, and thus that it needs an agent who refuses to believe in a god or gods to provide it with them.
