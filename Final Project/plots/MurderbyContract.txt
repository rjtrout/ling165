After several complicated attempts (which involve high voltage and flaming arrows), Claude is convinced he has killed her, but discovers that the police have faked her death. Convinced he will be unable to fulfill the contract, Claude quits, only to find the two men who have been assisting him have now been instructed to kill him. After killing the men, Claude finally succeeds in sneaking into the witnesss house, but hesitates when hes about to strangle her.
