In pre-Civil War Louisiana in 1854, young Timothy Reid Jr. (Breen) is orphaned. He inherits a plantation and its well-cared-for slaves. However, lawyer Martin Dill (Maxwell) is made the executor for the minor. Dill plots to sell off the slaves and flee to Paris with the proceeds. Timothy is befriended by Jacques Bouton (Mowbray), who persuades Judge Louis Ravenal (Greig) to look into the matter and save the day.
