Ollie Radway (Mary Boland) is a daffy dowager who, with equally eccentric brother John (Hugh Herbert), runs a thriving newspaper. After firing the managing editor for failing to keep her niece Virginia (Carol Hughes) out of the newspaper business, she hands the job to David Partridge (Frank McHugh), a minor employee with a crush on the girl. In short order, Partridge is assigned to keep Virginia away from fortune-hunting editorial artist Dimitri Kyeff (Mischa Auer).
