In the near future, Detroit, Michigan, is a dystopia on the verge of total collapse due to financial ruin and a high crime rate. The mayor signs a deal with the mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP), giving it complete control of the underfunded Detroit Police Department. In exchange, OCP will be allowed to turn the run-down sections of Detroit into a high-end utopia called Delta City. OCPs new CEO Dick Jones proposes assisting the police with the ED-209 enforcement droid. At its first demonstration, however, ED-209 malfunctions and gruesomely kills an executive. Bob Morton, an ambitious junior executive, uses the opportunity to introduce his own experimental cyborg design, "RoboCop". To Joness anger, the company chairman (referred to as the Old Man) approves Mortons plan. OCP ostensibly reassigns officers into crime-ridden districts in anticipation that someone will be killed in action for use as a test subject for RoboCop. Alex Murphy is newly-partnered to Anne Lewis; on their first patrol, they chase a gang of criminals, led by Clarence Boddicker. Boddickers gang hides in an abandoned steel mill and Murphy and Lewis separate on foot to find them. While Murphy manages to kill two of them, he is caught by Boddicker and the others; the gang tortures Murphy, brutally gunning him down before Boddicker personally executes him. He is declared dead and OCP selects him as the RoboCop candidate; they replace most of his body with cybernetics, leaving his human brain. RoboCop is programmed with three directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law; RoboCop, Morton, and his team are unaware of a classified fourth directive. RoboCop, assigned to Murphys former district, proceeds to efficiently rid the streets of crime. Meanwhile the deteriorating situation in Detroit lead by the mismanagement of OCP leads the human officers to threaten to strike. Lewis believes RoboCop is Murphy based on his exhibiting some of Murphys behaviors. As RoboCop suffers from latent memories from Murphy, he discovers his true identity and that his wife and son moved away after Murphys death. Jones, fearing he will be displaced by the newly-promoted Morton, discreetly hires Boddicker to murder Morton. During a hold-up at a gas station, RoboCop recognizes the robber as one of Boddickers gang, triggering memories of Murphys execution. RoboCop reviews police records, identifies the other gang members including Boddicker, and confronts them. During Boddickers arrest, he admits to being hired by Jones. With this evidence recorded on video, RoboCop attempts to arrest Jones at OCP; Jones openly admits his role in Mortons death before revealing what the fourth directive is: it prevents RoboCop from arresting any OCP executive officer or staff member. With RoboCops programming limiting his abilities, Jones sends the ED-209 (which has been stationed in his office) to attack RoboCop, severely damaging him. Jones also asks police to meet them at the tower. Lewis, who had been following RoboCop, helps him escape to safety of the same steel mill and undergo repairs. The police follow through with their strike, creating chaos in the city. Boddicker and his gang are released from prison and acquire new high-powered rifles to finish off RoboCop. Boddicker, using a tracking system provided to him by Jones, head towards the steel mill. RoboCop and Lewis work together to eliminate the gang, though Lewis is injured. RoboCop heads to OCP HQ alone and uses one of the rifles to destroy the ED-209 guarding the entrance. He barges in on an executive meeting where the Old Man and Jones are present and shows them the video of Jones confession. Jones takes the Old Man as a hostage, knowing that the fourth directive still protects him. The Old Man promptly fires Jones, nullifying the protection and allowing RoboCop to shoot Jones, who falls out of a window to his death. The Old Man gratefully asks for RoboCops name; he answers, "Murphy".
