In what is now Russia, a settlement of Vikings lives in peace with both the Tartars and the Slavs. All is well until Togrul, a Tartar chief seeks the help of Oleg, the chief of the Vikings to war on the Slavs in a surprise attack. Oleg refuses and the group does battle ending with Oleg killing Togrul and abducting Togruls daughter Samia as a hostage. Burundai, Togruls brother is furious and wishes the Viking settlement burnt to the ground. His High Priest Ciu Lang reminds Burundai that Samia is promised to the leader of the Tartars as his wife; her safety and return has a higher priority than Burundais revenge. Burundai gets his chance to retrieve Samia when a Viking longship is attacked with Helga, Olegs wife and her handmaidens captured. Burundai initially promises to treat Helga well as an exchange for Samia but tortures Helgas handmaidens to discover the strength of the Vikings. He also rapes Helga and gives her to his men for their further pleasure prior to exchanging her for Samia. Meanwhile, Samia has fallen in love with Olegs brother Eric and is pregnant with Erics child.
