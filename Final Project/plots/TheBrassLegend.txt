Clay Gipson, the little brother of Sheriff Wade Addams girlfriend, spots the fugitive and informs the sheriff, who knocks Hatten cold and takes him to jail. Town opinion turns against the popular Wade, who is suspected by girlfriend Lindas father, rancher Tom Gipson, of being after a reward for Hatten that rightfully should go to the boy, Clay.

A reporter named Tatum helps damage the sheriffs reputation by revealing Clay to be the informant. Clay is wounded by a gunshot, bringing dad Tom to his senses. After shooting two of the Barlows, proving his courage, Wade must apprehend Hatten, who has had a gun smuggled to him in jail. Hatten shoots the reporter, but cant outdraw Wade.
