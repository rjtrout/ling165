Taking after her mother, a western sheriff known as "Oklahoma Annie" to all, Judy manages to persuade new sheriff Dan Fraser to deputize her. After she helps capture outlaw Curt Walker, whos in cahoots with county supervisor Haskell, the sheriff feels confident enough in Judy to leave her in charge by herself while he rides to get the judge for Walkers trial. Things instantly go wrong for Judy, whose shooting skills are so ineffective that she attempts to use fireworks instead. Walker gets away and Dan ends up in grave danger, but with all the men gone in a posse, Judy rounds up other women in town and together they ride to Dans rescue. He decides to take the county supervisors job and appoints Judy as the new sheriff.
