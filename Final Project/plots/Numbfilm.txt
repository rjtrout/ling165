When modestly successful screenwriter Hudson Milbank (Matthew Perry) descends into a strange mood in which he feels detached from the world around him and unable to connect with his surroundings, either physically or emotionally, he initially attributes it to a night of excessive cannabis use. His writing partner Tom (Kevin Pollak) is disturbed by the sudden change in Hudsons demeanor and urges him to seek psychiatric help. Dr. Townsend (Bob Gunton) diagnoses his condition as depersonalization disorder and prescribes various medications including Clonazepam, and when nothing seems to help Hudson consults Dr. Richmond (Brian George), who also sees drugs, albeit divalproex sodium and others rather than Clonazepam, as the solution. Hudson meets Sara (Lynn Collins), a beautiful young woman who finds him attractive and appealing and decides to introduce him to as many positive and compelling experiences as possible. Also trying to help him is yet another psychiatrist, Dr. Blaine (Mary Steenburgen), who initially resists his advances but ultimately has an affair with him before revealing she has serious issues of her own that require professional attention.
