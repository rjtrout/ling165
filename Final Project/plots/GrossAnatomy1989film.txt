Joe Slovak is a brilliant first-year med student whose nonconformist approach to life is tested when he enrolls in gross anatomy, the toughest course in med school. His schoolfriends include Kim, a pregnant woman, Miles, a buttoned-down blue-blood, Laurie, an ambitious student determined to make it and David, an overanalyzer who is also his roommate. Joes freewheeling, independent style creates funny moments in the classroom, but puts him at odds with the demanding department head, Dr. Woodruff, who questions whether her easygoing "class rebel" has what it takes to be a doctor. Meanwhile, Joe falls in love with his lab partner Laurie, who wont let anything, especially romance, interfere with her plans. And while Joes never done anything by the book, he proves he does have what it takes to succeed â€” without changing his ways. However, Joes ways and the ways of medicine come to a header when he is ordered to do an extra credit assignment by Dr. Woodruff of a complex diagnosis. Joe correctly diagnoses it as a serious, difficult-to-treat chronic illness and learns the patient is Dr. Woodruff herself.
