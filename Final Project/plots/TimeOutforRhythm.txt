Harvard educated Danny Collins (Rudy Vall√©e) and street-wise Mike Armstrong (Richard Lane) team up after a chance meeting to form the most successful talent agency in New York City. Mike is in love with nightclub and Broadway songstress Frances Lewis (Rosemary Lane), determined to make her nationally famous with his and Dannys help. Danny sees her, correctly, as a self-centered opportunist willing to capitalize on Mikes affections to further her career. Eventually, she causes Danny and Mike to split. Around the same time Danny and his assistant Off-Beat Davis meet Frances maid Kitty Brown (Ann Miller), a shy tap-dancing wonder, and try to find her work... but without Mike, their new agency cannot get going successfully. Mike is not having any luck on his own either, despite the fact he and Frances are now engaged to be married. When Danny has the opportunity to produce a New York-based variety show with Kitty and Joan Merrill (as herself) as the headliners, he and Mike finally make amends when he needs Mikes help to seal the deal. But Frances blackmails Danny, threatening to break Mikes heart if she is not cast as the star of the show. Mike eventually learns about this and finally sees Frances for who she really is and leaves her. Mike moves forward, with Danny as his friend and business partner once again, to work on the show starring Kitty. The films musical finale begins with the Stooges (with help from co-stars Brenda and Cobina) performing a hilarious rhumba dance number, with Curly Howard dressed up as Carmen Miranda.
