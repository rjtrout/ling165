Hollywood talent scout Nancy Davis is told by her boss, J.M. Snively, to go find an unknown to become a new hero and star in "The Behemoth," his next big production. Nancy is just about out of ideas when she finds herself in Duluth, Minnesota impressed by the Rustlers hockey star, Andy Buell. They discuss the idea at a party at the home of Helen Dowell and her husband, Frankie, who is Andys friend and teammate on the ice. Andy actually wants to become an architect when he is finished with hockey. He is coaxed into giving Snivelys movie a try, but is attracted to Nancy, becomes distracted, his play suffers and the Rustlers begin losing, causing Andy to be jeered by the teams fans. Things continue to go wrong. Andy loses his future job with the architectural firm. His temper flares, he gets drunk and jailed, then takes out his aggression on the ice, where Frankie is seriously hurt. Snively hears the crowd boo and rescinds the offer and fires Nancy on the spot. Before the next game, Andy gives a blood transfusion to Frankie at the hospital. He shows up in the third period, leads the Rustlers to victory and is able to get his architect job back after all.
