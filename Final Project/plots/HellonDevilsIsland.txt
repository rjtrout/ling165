In the French Guinea prison known as Devils Island, the ruthless commandant Bayard savagely beats Paul Rigaud and other convicts. The islands new governor, Renault, is determined to put an end to such brutality. Efforts by the evil Bayard and his seductive accomplice Suzanne, a cafe owner, fail to keep Rigaud confined and he is released. He meets up with former cellmate Lulu and is approached by Governor Renault, who has discovered Rigaud was a newspaper editor who was imprisoned unjustly for his published opinions. Renault requests that Rigaud help him expose the prisons cruel punishments, with help from the governors daughter, Giselle. Suzanne agrees to betray Bayard, only to be stabbed to death by a bartender loyal to the commandant. Justice is ultimately done, however, after which Rigaud and Lulu begin personally tearing down the barriers of the prison.
