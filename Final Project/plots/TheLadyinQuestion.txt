While serving on a Paris jury Andre Morestan (Brian Aherne) persuades his deadlocked peers to vote for the acquittal of Natalie Roguin (Rita Hayworth), a young woman on trial for the death of a young man she had been seeing. Securing her exculpation, Morestan invites her to live and work at his bicycle and music shop when no one else will give her a job. However, he decides to keep her true identity a secret, which soon begins to raise doubts within his family. His son (Glenn Ford) soon falls in love with her, even though he knows who she is. Eventually, Andre is persuaded by a fellow former juror that she was in fact guilty. He goes to the authorities, but learns from them that new evidence has turned up that completely exonerates her.
