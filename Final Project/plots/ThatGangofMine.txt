Old horseman Ben (Clarence Muse) brings his beloved thoroughbred Bluenight to New York from Kentucky in hopes of developing him into a championship racer. Because the old man is down on his luck, the East Side boys offer to provide a makeshift quarters for Bluenight, and Algy Wilkes (Eugene Francis) persuades his father (Milton Kibbee) to put up the entrance fee for the horse. Muggs Maloney (Leo Gorcey), an aspiring but untested jockey, rides Bluenight in the race, but loses his nerve on the track, causing Bluenight to trail in the field. Seated in the stands is Morgan (Forrest Taylor), a respected trainer, who recognizes the horses ability and urges Mr. Wilkes to race the horse with an experienced jockey. However, Muggs insists upon doing the riding, and his pals induce Mr. Wilkes to give him another chance. Complications arise the night before the race when Nick (Wilbur Mack), a crooked bookie, tries to sabotage Bluenight. The boys discover the plot and save the horse, but the next day, Muggs realizes that he cannot guide the horse to victory. With the use of his fists, he convinces jockey Jimmy Sullivan (Nick Wall) to take his place, and Bluenight finishes the race the winner.
