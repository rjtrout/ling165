The film begins away from the coast of Korea during the Korean War. Commander Collier (Hayden) is in charge of air operations on a carrier, or flat top. When asked about how he first handled his job, he goes back to the time of World War II, where the film takes place. Told in flashback form, Collier recounts the war in the Pacific, working flight ops on the same carrier with a new second officer, Lt. (j.g.) Joe Rogers (Carlson), and getting a group of pilots ready for the tough fight to come against the Japanese.
