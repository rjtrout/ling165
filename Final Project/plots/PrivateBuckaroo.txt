Entertainer Lon Prentice initially is keen to enlist in the US Army but is prevented from this due to his having one flat foot. After having the flat fixed, he is accepted for enlistment. Soon after basic training begins, Private Prentice informs his commanding officer that he finds most military training useless, unnecessary and beneath him. His commander orders all the men that Private Prentice is exempt from doing things he doesnt want to do, which turns the entire camp against him.
