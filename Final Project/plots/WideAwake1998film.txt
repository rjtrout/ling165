During his year in the fifth grade, ten-year-old Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross) begins a personal search to find answers about life and death â€” a journey triggered by the passing of his beloved grandfather (Robert Loggia). Josh attends Waldron Mercy Academy, a private Catholic boys school. The adults in his world have not been able to convince him that his grandfather is in good hands, so he sets out on a personal mission to find God. In their varying ways he is guided on his metaphorical journey by his best friend Dave (Timothy Reifsnyder) and a Philadelphia Phillies-loving nun (Rosie ODonnell) who teaches at his school. Josh shows doubts about his religion as he questions if God truly exists, particularly when Dave is diagnosed with epilepsy and the moments as Josh experiences his first crush. As his academic year comes to an end, he finds his answer in an unexpected way.
