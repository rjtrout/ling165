At West Point Military Academy in 1854, cadet Carl Rader—an agent of John Brown (Van Heflin)—is dishonorably discharged for distributing anti-slavery pamphlets. His classmates Jeb Stuart (Errol Flynn) and George Custer (Ronald Reagan) become second lieutenants and are posted to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Territory, the most dangerous duty in the army—an assignment they relish. On the way to Kansas, Custer and Stuart meet Cyrus K. Holliday, in charge of building the railroad to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and his daughter Kit (Olivia de Havilland), with whom both officers fall in love. The Kansas Territory is bloodstained and war-torn, a victim of John Browns (Raymond Massey) relentless crusade against slavery. Meanwhile, Rader has enlisted as a mercenary in Browns army, which has been terrorizing the countryside. During Browns attack on a freight wagon under the protection of the U.S. Army, Stuart and Custer capture Browns injured son Jason (Gene Reynolds) and, before dying, the troubled boy informs them about his fathers hideout at Shubel Morgans ranch in Palmyra. In disguise, Stuart rides into Palmyra, the center of the Underground Railroad, but Browns men spot his horses army brand. He is captured and taken to Brown at gunpoint. Attempting to escape, Stuart is trapped in a burning barn but is saved as Custer leads the cavalry to the rescue, driving Brown into seclusion. Three years later, in 1859, believing that Browns force has been broken, Stuart and Custer are sent back to Washington, D.C., where Stuart proposes to Kit. However, Brown is planning to re-ignite war by raiding the arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. When Brown refuses to pay Rader for his services, Rader rides to Washington to alert Stuart of Browns plans, and the troops arrive just in time to crush the rebellion. Brown is then tried for treason by the state of Virginia and hanged. The movie ends with the marriage of Stuart and Kit.
