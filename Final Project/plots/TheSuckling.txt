The film relates the tale of a teenage couple seeking an abortion at a Brooklyn brothel. Following the operation, toxic waste transforms the discarded fetus into a mutant beast, complete with prehensile umbilical cord and hooked talons for hands. Hunting the customers and employees of the house of ill repute, the mutant envelops the house in an enormous placenta and slaughters the inhabitants one by one.
