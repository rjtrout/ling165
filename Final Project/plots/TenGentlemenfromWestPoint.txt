In the early 19th century, West Point Military Academy opens despite some doubting its worth - including the officer in charge, Sam Carter. A number of men enlist in the first class, including rich Howard Shelton and Kentucky backwoodsman Joe Dawson. The men are initially antagonistic towards each other, especially when Joe falls for Howards fiance, Carolyn Brainbridge. The men take part in the war against Tecumseh with William Henry Harrison.
