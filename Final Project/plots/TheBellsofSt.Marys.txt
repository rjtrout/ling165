The unconventional Father Charles "Chuck" OMalley (Bing Crosby) is assigned to St. Marys parish, which includes a run-down inner-city school building on the verge of being condemned. OMalley is to recommend whether or not the school should be closed and the children sent to another school with modern facilities; but the sisters feel that God will provide for them. They put their hopes in Horace P. Bogardus (Henry Travers), a businessman who has built a modern building next door to the school which they hope he will donate to them. Father OMalley and the dedicated but stubborn Sister Superior, Mary Benedict (Ingrid Bergman), both wish to save the school, but their different views and methods often lead to disagreements. One disagreement involves a student (Richard Tyler) who is being bullied by another. A more serious one regards the promotion of an eighth-grade student, Patsy (Joan Carroll), whom the parish has taken in while her mother (Martha Sleeper) attempts to get back on her feet. At one point, Sister Benedict contracts tuberculosis, and the physician recommends to Father OMalley that she be transferred to a dry climate with non-parochial duties, but without telling her the reason. She assumes the transfer is because of her disagreements with OMalley, and struggles to understand the reasons for the path set out for her. Right before Sister Benedict departs, Father OMalley reveals the true reason for her temporary transfer.
