During the filming of a TV commercial for a "Meat For Go" campaign set in Londons Smithfield Market, stuntman Steve (Dave Clark), disillusioned by the inanity of his job, absconds in an E-type Jaguar (one of the props) with a young actress/model, Dinah (Barbara Ferris). After a visit to Oasis Swimming Pools, an open-air swimming-pool in central London, and a memorable scene in and around the Great Conservatory in the grounds of Syon House, they make their way across a wintry southern England towards Burgh Island, off the coast of Devon, which Dinah is contemplating buying, presumably to escape the pressures of her celebrity as the "Butcher Girl" on the back of the TV meat advertising campaign. This act of rebellion is cynically exploited by the advertising executive behind the campaign, Leon Zissell (David de Keyser), who deputes two of his henchmen to pursue the fleeing couple. On their journey, Steve and Dinah encounter first a group of proto-hippies, squatting in MOD-owned buildings on Salisbury Plain (some of this sequence was shot in the evacuated village of Imber) and then an unhappily married middle-aged couple (Yootha Joyce and Robin Bailey) in the opulent surroundings of the Royal Crescent in Bath, Somerset. Steve also plans to visit his boyhood hero, Louie (David Lodge), whose youth club in Londons East End he attended, and who has since relocated to Devon. Having fled the police, and Leon Zissells henchmen, after a fancy-dress party in the Roman Baths at Bath, Steve and Dinah (with the rest of Steves gang - and the police - in hot pursuit) make their way towards Devon. Steves encounter with Louie is disappointing. Louie recognises Dinah instantly, because of her TV celebrity, but fails to recognise Steve and misremembers his name, even after being introduced. Dinahs island also proves to be disappointing. At low tide, it is reachable from the mainland, and Zissell, who is clearly besotted with Dinah, has already arrived.
