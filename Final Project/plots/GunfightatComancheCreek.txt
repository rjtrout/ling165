A gang of Colorado bank robbers led by Amos Troop (DeForest Kelley) uses a technique where they break prisoners out of jail, use them to commit crimes, then later kill them to collect the reward. A detective, Gifford (Audie Murphy), goes undercover with the gang to bring them to justice. Saloon owner Abbie Stevens takes a liking to Gifford while he infiltrates the gang. So does a young outlaw, Kid Carter, who goes to the towns marshal to get help for Gifford, only to discover the marshals actually the ringleader of the gang. Help arrives in the nick of time, and Gifford guns down Troop and his men.
