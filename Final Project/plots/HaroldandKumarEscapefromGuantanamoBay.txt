After returning home from White Castle, Harold Lee and Kumar Patel decide to travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands so Harold can surprise his neighbor and newfound girlfriend Maria. At the airport, the duo encounter Kumars ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harolds whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumars bong for a bomb and the duo are apprehended by sky marshals. Ron Fox, a neurotic and racist Deputy of Secretary of Homeland Security, believes the duo are agents of a joint Al-Qaeda and North Korean conspiracy and send them to Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. The duo escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to Miami, Florida where they begin their trek to Texas, hoping Colton can clear their names. On the road, Kumar has flashbacks of meeting Vanessa in college. The duo endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of incestuous sibling couple and their imbred son, escaping a Ku Klux Klan rally, and visiting a brothel with Neil Patrick Harris, who helps them evade capture from Fox. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to exonerate the duo, but upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers them to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox and his guards and escape via parachute. Fox falls to his death in the struggle. The two land in President George W. Bushs estate. While smoking cannabis with the duo, Bush pardons them. The duo are escorted to Vanessa and Coltons wedding by Secret Service and expose Coltons betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton confronts them, but Harold punches him out. Kumar consoles a furious Vanessa by reciting a poem he wrote for her in college and they reconcile. Harold, Kumar, and Vanessa travel to Amsterdam where Harold finds Maria. The couples happily tour the city while getting high off cannabis.
