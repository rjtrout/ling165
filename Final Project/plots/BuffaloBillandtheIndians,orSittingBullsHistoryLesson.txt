The story begins in 1885 with the arrival of an important new guest star in Buffalo Bill Codys grand illusion, Chief Sitting Bull of Little Big Horn fame. Much to Codys annoyance, Sitting Bull proves not to be a murdering savage but a genuine embodiment of what the whites believe about their own history out west. He is quietly heroic and morally pure. Sitting Bull also refuses to portray Custers Last Stand as a cowardly sneak attack. Instead, he asks Cody to act out the massacre of a peaceful Sioux village by marauding bluecoats. An enraged Cody fires him but is forced to relent when star attraction Annie Oakley takes Sitting Bulls side.
