Megan Leavey is a US Marine corporal who served as a Military Police K9 handler. She was paired with military working dog Rex (E168). The pair served two deployments in Iraq together. They were first deployed to Fallujah in 2005, and then to Ramadi in 2006, where they were both wounded by an improvised explosive device. Leavey was awarded the Purple Heart and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with a "V" device denoting heroism in combat. In 2012, Rex developed facial palsy, which ended his bomb-sniffing duties. Leavey adopted him through the intervention of Senator Chuck Schumer around April 2012. Rex died on December 22, 2012.
