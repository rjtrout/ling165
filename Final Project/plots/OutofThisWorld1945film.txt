Betty Miller and her all-women orchestra are struggling until singer Herbie Fenton joins the band. The picture was a satire on the Frank Sinatra ‘bobby soxer’ cult. A shy Western Union messenger, Herbie is accidentally pushed on stage and ends up becoming an overnight radio sensation when he sings at a benefit show where Betty and her all-girl band is playing. He has a romance with Betty, who then sells more than 100% of his contract to various "managers" while Herbie receives only fifty dollars per week. One of those managers, Dorothy Dodge, hires "bobby soxers" to swoon at his performances.
