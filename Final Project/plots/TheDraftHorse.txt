A farm horse sees a poster that says the U.S. Army needs horses. The horse goes to the recruiting station and tries to volunteer, but is eventually rejected, labeled "44-F". Leaving the station dejected, he wanders into a wargames situation, and the flying bullets frighten him so much he makes a dash for home. At the end, he is serving the war effort in another way, knitting "V for Victory" sweaters for the boys overseas. One amusing bit that highlights the Warner cartoonists penchant for going to the edge of general public taste without quite crossing over, is this "eye chart test", underscored by the music connected with Youre in the Army Now,: Youre in the Army now [normal size letters] Youre not behind the plow [smaller letters] Youll never get rich [very small letters] By diggin a ditch [letters too small to read] YOURE IN THE ARMY NOW! [huge letters] The missing line can either be rendered "You son-of-a-bitch" or "By diggin a ditch", depending on the audience. A similar gag was employed by Tex Avery in MGMs 1942 cartoon, Blitz Wolf.
