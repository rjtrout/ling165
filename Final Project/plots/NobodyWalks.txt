23-year-old Martine (Olivia Thirlby) has just arrived in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles when she moves into a wealthy familys pool house, and begins working to complete her art film. Meanwhile, Peter (John Krasinski), a laid-back father of two, agrees to his wifes request to help their young guest complete the project. The more time Martine spends with her surrogate family, the more apparent it becomes no one will walk away from this situation unchanged.
