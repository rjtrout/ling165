Colonel John Wister (Ian Hunter) is in charge of a post in the British desert colony of Dickit. While on leave in England he meets and falls in love with the beautiful American Julia Ashton (Kay Francis), whose aviator fianc√© died in an aircraft accident. Although Julia does not love John, she likes him and agrees to his marriage proposal. John takes Julia to Dickit, where she meets Johns best friend, Captain Denny Roark (Errol Flynn), and Dennys sister, Grace (Frieda Inescort), who is secretly in love with John. Denny reminds Julia of her dead fiance and the two of them fall in love. John discovers this and although he would give her a divorce, he knows that she is too decent to leave him. An uprising by local Arabs means one of the soldiers must fly a suicidal bombing mission. Denny volunteers but as he is saying good bye to Julia, John flies off instead, sacrificing his life so that his best friend and wife can be together.
