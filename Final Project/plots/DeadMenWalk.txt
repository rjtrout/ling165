The story involves a kindly small-town physician Doctor Lloyd Clayton (Zucco), who has secretly murdered his twin brother Elwyn, because of Elwyns deep involvement in satanic occult practices. Only Elwyns hunchback assistant Zolarr (Frye) suspects the good doctor of doing away with his master and confronts him on this matter, but the doctor maintains that he only acted in self-defense when his brother had become a danger to society. Meanwhile, because Elwyn has gone far with his study of the dark arts before his demise, he returns to life as an evil supernatural being who begins murdering the villagers by draining them of their blood. The doctor and his beautiful young niece, Gayle Clayton (Carlisle), and her fianc√©, soon discover that Elwyn still lives, and are in peril of their lives for this knowledge. Dr. Clayton realizes the only way he can help his niece now is to again kill Elwyn, and plans to conquer him with fire. Clayton, unfortunately, becomes also trapped in the resulting conflagration, and like Elwyn and Zolarr, perishes in the flames of Elwyns accursed library.
