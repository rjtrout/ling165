Retired detective Charlie Chan is asked for his help by the San Francisco police to solve a new series of murders. This time his usual sidekick, Number One Son, has been replaced by Lees own son, Lee Chan, Jr. The prime suspect in the killings is a shady lady known as the Dragon Queen, but soon Chans suspicions fall elsewhere. Among those at risk are Lees maternal grandmother, Mrs. Lupowitz. Even though Charlie Chans son is, as is usually the case, rarely accurate in reading clues, he has the full love and support of Cordelia, his beautiful fianc√©e.
