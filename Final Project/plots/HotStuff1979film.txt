Miami police detectives Ernie, Louise, Ramon, and Doug (played by DeLuise, Pleshette, Avalos, and Reed), frustrated at their inability to convict the criminals they arrest, decide to set up a sting as a fencing operation to trap criminals in a pawn shop, recording the illegal transactions on the (then) new technology of videotape. With less than helpful support from their captain (Davis), the trio decides to re-sell some of their stolen items to stay in business. Trouble follows as they run afoul of the local mob boss. Doug sees his car destroyed by a bomb (and laments "I just had it washed"), he and the others have a shootout with gun runners at a waterfront condominium construction site, and they ultimately arrest the criminals en masse at a party.
