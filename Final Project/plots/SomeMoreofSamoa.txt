The Stooges are tree surgeons who are enlisted by a rich old man to find a mate for his rare puckerless persimmon tree. The boys sail to the fictional tropical island of Rhum-Boogie to find the tree. When they arrive they are captured by the natives and will be eaten unless Curly marries the Chiefs ugly sister. The Stooges manage to escape with the tree and, after a confrontation with an alligator, sail off with their prize.
