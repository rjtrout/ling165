Set in and around the Sands Hotel, the film has a fairly simple plot, telling "what happens when a gambling rancher (Dailey) discovers that all he has to do to win at roulette is take hold of ballerina Charisses hand." The film was tailored for the talents of Charisse, showcasing her modern ballet dancing. Several popular singers are featured as themselves. The location shooting gives a good idea of what Las Vegas looked like in 1956.
