The main character, Ray Stokes (Olivier Gruner) is a down-on-his luck police officer on a distant, corruptly-ruled mining colony. He has already lost his wife Dana (Anna Karin) to his corrupt boss, John Dawson (Craig Wasson), not from any failure in romantic rivalry, but as part of a deal to pay off their dead daughters medical bills: making her Dawsons "Contract Wife". Samuel Nelson (Harry Wowchuk), an Enforcement Division chief of security, is sent to clean up the Colonys local Enforcement Division, but is killed in the course of his investigation. Stokes is framed for the murder of another ED officer, also killed by Nelsons assassin. However, Dawson is implicated in Nelsons death and wants to avoid any inquiry. He sends Stokes on a six-month trip to Earth, protecting a cargo of cash. Meanwhile, the crew of The Endeavour has planned to intercept the money ship while the crew are in hibernation. The interception occurs, Stokes and Beth Sheffield (Alicia Coppola), the attractive female navigator, are the only survivors of the ensuing gun play; they steal the money and buy the mining colony. The evil boss is arrested, and presumably they all live happily ever after.
