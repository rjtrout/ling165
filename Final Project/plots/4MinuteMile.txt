A teen track runner Drew (Kelly Blatz) is struggling on the track as well as at home. He accepts an offer from his reclusive neighbor (Richard Jenkins) to train him and the two form a bond. The movie 4 Minute Mile tells the inspirational story of Drew, a high school student struggling to overcome the inner-city surroundings that threaten to imprison him. After getting manipulated into running drug payments to a local dealer, Drew has nowhere to turn in a family with a deadbeat older brother and an overwhelmed single mom. His only outlet is track practice, but that is taken from him as he continues down the path of his sibling; even the affections of a girl at school can’t set him straight. Just as it seems hopeless, an ex-track coach with his own demons witnesses Drew’s speed and athleticism and decides to train him to reach for more than he ever imagined possible. Together they work towards finding solace in each other, but Drew’s resolve is threatened as tragedy strikes right before the biggest race of his life and forces him to confront everything that has been holding him back.
