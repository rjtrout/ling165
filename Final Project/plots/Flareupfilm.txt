Michele (Welch) is a Vegas dancer who is, as the saying goes, red hot: maybe too hot, for in this film, she learns that somebody wants her dead. She gets help from the cops, but along the way the killer stays on her trail, and she learns it may be a man she knows. It also features Welch dancing to the song Suzie Q, which became a hit song by Creedence Clearwater Revival.
