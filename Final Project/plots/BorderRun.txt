Stone portrays journalist Sofie Talbert, a hard-hitting journalist against illegal immigration to the United States. Learning that her brother in Mexico has gone missing, she goes to find him and uncovers the brutal reality of the desperate people who risk their lives to cross into the States. The film also points out that some illegals are twice-removed from their country of origin, crossing from Central America into Mexico first, which is equally hazardous.
