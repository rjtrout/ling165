The film revolves around Tobi, a middle-aged ex-dancer now working as a ballet instructor at the Juilliard School in New York City. He is asked for an interview by husband and wife Mike and Lisa, who claim they are preparing a dissertation on the dance community of the 1960s. Through the course of the interview, Mikes questions keep getting more and more personal. He finally reveals that he suspects that Tobi is his biological father, as indicated by Mikes mother on her deathbed. When Tobi denies this, Mike forcefully takes a DNA sample from Tobi and rushes to a police lab, where his friend Jim performs a DNA test. Outraged by Mikes violence, Lisa stays to help Tobi clean up the mess Mike made. She bonds with Tobi as a person and Tobi reveals that he knows he is Mikes father, but denied it out of shame. He had abandoned the boy for his career. He also reveals that he paid a part of Mikes college tuition for college. When Mike returns to take Lisa home, the three have an argument. Tobi tells Mike to treat his wife well. After further argument, in which Mike tells Tobi he chose to make his life so that no one loves him, the pair leave. Lisa convinces Tobi to tell Mike the truth. He also invites the pair for brunch the next day. On their way to Tobis house the next morning, Mike is called by Jim, who tells him that the DNA was not a match. When Lisa and Mike tell Tobi this, he has a nervous breakdown, and politely asks them to let him be alone. As the movie ends, Tobi is heard calling friends to take them up on an offer of a dinner party.
