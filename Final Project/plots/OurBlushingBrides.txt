Fellow department store shopgirls and roommates Gerry March (Crawford), Connie Blair (Anita Page) and Franky Daniels (Dorothy Sebastian) take different paths in New York City, but all seek to marry wealthy men. Connie pursues an affair with David Jardine (Raymond Hackett), son of the department store owner. Meanwhile, Franky meets the slick-talking Marty Sanderson (John Miljan) when he comes into the store to buy $500 worth of towels. However, when Sanderson comes to pick Franky up, he hits on Gerry instead. At the same time, Gerry has been constantly courted by the dashing Tony Jardine (Robert Montgomery), elder son of the store owner. He is used to getting what he wants, but when he invites her to visit the gardens on his estate alone. Gerry, who believes that virtue will be her only reward, rebuffs Tony and intimates that he is childish. Franky falls in love with Sanderson, who spoils her with diamonds and silk. Gerry is suspicious, especially when she finds them both drunk and has to lead Franky out. However, unbeknownst to them, Sanderson is the leader of a criminal gang that steals from department stores like the one the women work at. The police come to apprehend Franky, believing she is a part of the gang, but she knows nothing of it. Meanwhile, Connie is very happy with David and intends to marry him. However, she reads in the newspaper that David intends to marry the high-society Evelyn Woodforth (Martha Sleeper). She listens to the reception being broadcast on the radio and takes poison in an attempt kill herself. Gerry finds her and goes to Tony in order to force David to leave his reception to visit Connie. In a contentious conversation, Tony forces David to leave and visit Connie, and this selfless act attracts Gerry and convinces her that Tony is a good guy after all. However, despite Davids visit, Connie dies.
