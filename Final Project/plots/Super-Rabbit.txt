Professor Cannafraz (a Richard Haydn impression) creates a "super carrot" and uses it on his test subject â€“ Rabbitus idioticus americanus (Bugs Bunny), who immediately wolfs down the proffered carrot. Armed with temporary superhero abilities that need to be replenished with additional super carrots, Bugs remembers a newspaper article about Texas hunter "Cottontail" Smith, who wants to hunt down all rabbits. Bugs flies to Deepinaharta, Texas, and assumes the moniker of a mild-mannered forest creature, complete with oversized glasses and hat. He encounters Smith, who attempts to shoot Bugs, only for the bullets to form an outline of Bugs before harmlessly falling to the ground. Bugs then hands Smith a cannon, eats another carrot then, upon being struck by the cannonball, plays basketball with it, quickly shoving Smith and his horse onto bleachers while he acts as his own cheerleader. After Bugs returns to the air, the bemused Smith and his horse fly into the sky with their own airplane. Bugs then snatches the shell of the plane away from them, plunging them to the ground. Bugs runs out of power, but when he tries to recharge again, his carrots fall to the ground. When Bugs lands, he opens his eyes to see a line of chewed-up carrots eaten by Smith and his horse-turned-Superhero. Bugs turns to the camera and says "This looks like a job for a REAL Superman!" He ducks into a phone booth. Both Smith and the horse are ready to attack - until the booth opens and they both snap to attention and salute. Bugs marches out in a Marine uniform, singing the "Marines Hymn." He dismisses the two, claiming he has "important work to do!", and marches off to "Berlin, Tokyo and points East."
