Sam Houston fights beside his friend Andrew Jackson and is wounded. Not long thereafter, Jackson is elected President of the United States and appoints Houston as governor of Tennessee. Houston is married to Eliza Allen, but his lifestyle as a politician does not appeal to her. Their divorce is somewhat scandalous for the time, and Houston decides to accept Jacksons suggestion that he become ambassador to the Cherokee tribe instead. On a trip to Washington, D.C., to put forth his argument how the Indians are being mistreated in their own land, Houston falls in love with Margaret Lea at a presidential ball. She returns with him to Texas, where the next mission for Houston is to free the territory from the rule of Mexico, either by diplomacy or on the battlefield. Stephen F. Austin disagrees with Houstons methods, preferring peaceful negotiations. But when the army of Santa Ana heads toward the Alamo in tremendous numbers, Houston knows there can be no peaceful settlement. He arrives too late to prevent the carnage there, but then leads the Texans in their fight for freedom and statehood.
