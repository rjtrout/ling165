Hoops McCann, a recent high school graduate, fails to get a basketball scholarship, disappointing his parents. He hopes to be admitted to the Rhode Island School of Design, and must write and illustrate a love story for his application. He joins with his friends, siblings George and Squid Calamari, to spend the summer on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts. En route, they pick up a young rock singer named Cassandra Eldridge, who is pursued by a motorcycle gang at the time. Once on the island, Hoops and George, along with his island friends the Stork twins and Ack-Ack Raymond, must help Cassandra save her grandfathers house from the greedy Beckersted Family. Along the way, Hoops must find a way to write his cartoon love story. With the prize returned and the house spared, Hoops and Cassandra engage in a kiss, and she gives him a love story for his application. In the final scene, Georges uncle Frank (having been driven insane every summer for trying to win a $1 million prize from a radio contest) finally wins, but his phone gets disconnected and his prize is given away to someone else; he snaps and promptly uses a rocket launcher to blow up the radio station, just as the Stork twins arrive and head to the fiery remains to roast marshmallows.
