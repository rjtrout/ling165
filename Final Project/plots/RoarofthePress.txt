Married only a few hours, small-town girl Alice makes her first visit to New York with new husband Wally Williams, a hotshot reporter for the Globe. A body falls from a building. Williams steals the identification and calls in the story to city editor MacEwen, who makes Wally follow it up. Reporters wives warn Alice to expect this kind of thing. A personal ad leads Wally to a second corpse. The police read about in the Globe and angrily haul Wally in for questioning. Alices irritation grows, as does that of reporters from other newspapers at Wallys continued scoops. Evildoers from an anti-American organization kidnap Wally, and when he wont reveal how he gets his information, they grab Alice as well. Sparrow McGraun runs a numbers racket but likes Wally better than these foreigners, so he saves the newlyweds. A grateful Wally gives this scoop to every paper except the Globe.
