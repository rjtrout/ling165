Arbuckle, a butcher boy in a country store, is in love with Almondine (Alice Lake), the daughter of the stores general manager Mr. Grouch. Fattys attempts to get close to her are sidetracked when the stores clerk Alum (Al St. John), a rival for Alices affections, starts a fight with the rotund butcher. Their confrontation in the store soon involves an earlier customer (Buster Keaton) as well as Grouch. The resulting mayhem includes small bags of flour being hurled and "exploding", pies being tossed, and brooms being wildly swung amid the thick clouds of flour lingering in the air. Determined to marry Almondine, Fatty later disguises himself as a female cousin and follows her to an all-girls boarding school. Unfortunately, Alum has the same idea and masquerades too as a female student. After another fight breaks out between Fatty and Alum, Fatty is taken by the schools principal Miss Teachem to a separate room to be punished. Meanwhile, Alum and his accomplices (Keaton and Joe Bordeaux) attempt to kidnap Almondine. Luckily, Fattys dog Luke distracts the gang while Fatty and Almondine escape. Once outside, the couple see a sign on a tree identifying a nearby parsonage, so they run off arm-in-arm to get married there. Note that the subtitles in a later release of The Butcher Boy cite new names for the characters: Alum is "Slim Snavely" and Almondine is "Amanda".
