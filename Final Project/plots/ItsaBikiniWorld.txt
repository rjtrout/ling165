Young surfer Mike Samson (Tommy Kirk), the local beach jock, is quite the ladies man until he meets Delilah Dawes (Deborah Walley). At first, he tries to add her to his harem, but she rejects him because she finds him chauvinistic and shallow, so he disguises himself as a nerdy twin brother, "Herbert". In the meantime, publisher Harvey Pulp (Jack Bernardi) plans to start a new magazine called "Teen Scream". He joins forces with "Daddy" (Sid Haig), car, surfboard, and skateboard customizer — and owner of local music club The Dungeon — to publicize the venture. Pulp and Daddy organize a series of contests, and Delilah competes against "Mike" with the encouragement of "Herbert" in various events, and loses each time. However, Mike finds that he is falling in love with her. Eventually, Delilah finds out about the deception. Soon the two compete in a final race, using various vehicles.
