Julian Berniers returns from Illinois with his young bride Lily Prine to the family in New Orleans. His spinster sisters Carrie and Anna welcome the couple, who arrive with expensive gifts. Julian tells them that while his factory went out of business, he did manage to save money. While the sisters are skeptical, there is much talk of a long-hoped-for trip to Europe for the two sisters. In fact, Julian has money from a real estate deal that he pulled off with the help of a former lover, Charlotte Warkins, who is now in an abusive marriage. Carrie is obsessed with her brother. Her jealousy, instigated by her sublimated incestuous desires for her brother, is aimed at Lily. Carrie tricks Lily into informing Charlottes husband of a rendezvous between Charlotte and Julian, at which Julian was to give Charlotte her half of the money, and Charlotte was then going to leave her husband and escape the town. Charlottes husband sends thugs who beat up Julian and maim Charlotte. The thugs take all the money, both Charlottes and Julians halves. Julian returns to the house and discovers that Carrie manipulated Lily into making the phone call to Charlottes husband, by convincing her that they were actually going to leave together. After Carrie hurls insults at Julian and Anna, telling them they will both be failures, both leave the house, Julian to find and reconcile with Lily, and Anna going to Europe. Carrie is left alone, deluding herself into thinking they will both return one day.
