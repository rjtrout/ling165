The film follows British Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard (Keith Andes), who sets out to earn a reward by proving that privateer Henry Morgan (Torin Thatcher) also engages in piracy. Maynard poses as a surgeon on board the ship of pirate Charles Bellamy, who he believes is in league with Morgan. Once Maynard and fellow spy Briggs come on board, they discover that the pirate Blackbeard has murdered Bellamy and taken over as captain. Also on board is Edwina Mansfield, a pirates daughter,who was going to marry Bellamy. Blackbeard knows that Morgan loves Mansfield and will pursue her. Blackbeard orders Maynard to remove a bullet from his neck, and demands sailor Gilly watch him. Gilly slips Maynard a note begging him to slit the pirates throat, but Maynard declines. Maynard slips into the Blackbeards quarters and finds Bellamys logbook, which he hopes will contain evidence that Bellamy gave Morgan stolen goods. Maynard then defends Edwina against the unwanted advances of a lecherous pirate, killing him with his dagger. She tells Maynard that she agreed to marry Bellamy to escape from Morgan, from whom she has stolen treasure, which is now hidden in a clothes chest. Blackbeard breaks open one of Edwinas chests but discovers only letters in which Edwina implicates Morgan as Bellamys ally. Maynard tries to steal the letter, but Blackbeard stops him, noting that if Morgan were arrested, all of his loot would go to the King. Blackbeard finally identifies the treasure chest and claims it.
