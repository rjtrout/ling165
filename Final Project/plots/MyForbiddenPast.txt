In 1890s New Orleans, wrongly believing Barbara Beaurevelle (Ava Gardner) had stood him up on the eve of their elopement, Dr. Mark Lucas (Robert Mitchum) has returned from South Africa accompanied by Corinne (Janis Carter), a woman he married on the rebound. Determined to win him back, Barbara bribes her cousin (Melvyn Douglas) to break up the marriage, a cold-blooded scheme that ends in death and the doctor suspected of murder.
