When 17-year-old Jane Broadbent (Sandra Dee) comes to London to live with her wealthy father Jimmy Broadbent (Rex Harrison), her stepmother Sheila (Kay Kendall) feels compelled by her own social aspirations to introduce Jane to society. Jane is bored by the debutante balls she attends and the young men she is introduced to, but becomes interested in a drummer named David Parkson (John Saxon), who has a reputation for leading young women astray. To complicate matters, an upper class man with perfect credentials, David Fenner (Peter Myers), relentlessly pursues Jane, even though she openly detests him. Parksons reputation is undeserved, but Sheila is convinced otherwise. She tries to keep him away from Jane while her garrulous friend, Mabel (Angela Lansbury), schemes to secure David Fenner for her own daughter, Clarissa (Diane Clare). Fortunately for Jane and David, Sheilas plans fail miserably. The two young people fall in love with each other, and David Parkson proposes to Jane. He also inherits an Italian title of nobility which makes him a better "catch" than David Fenner and satisfies Sheilas concerns for Janes social status.
