After three years in prison, Cruella de Vil has been cured of her desire for fur coats by Dr. Pavlov and is released into the custody of the probation office on the provision that she will be forced to pay the remainder of her fortune (eight million pounds) to all the dog shelters in the borough of Westminster should she repeat her crime. Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her valet Alonzo and has him lock away all her fur coats. Cruellas probation officer, Chloe Simon, nevertheless suspects her, partly because Chloe is the owner of the now-adult Dipstick (one of the original 15 puppies from the previous film) who moved from Roger and Anitas house to her house. Dipsticks mate, Dottie, has recently given birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper and Oddball (who lacks spots). To mend her reputation, Cruella buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, to resolve its financial insolvency that is on the verge of eviction. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapys subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states but conceals this discovery. When Big Ben rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality and enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal 102 Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood. When Kevin tells Chloe that if Cruella violates her parole, her entire fortune will go to him, since his dog shelter is the only one in the borough of Westminster, Cruella has Kevin framed for the theft of the puppies and invites Chloe and Dipstick to dinner while LePelt steals Dottie and her three puppies. Dipstick hurries back to the apartment and hides in LePelts truck but is later captured at the train station. Chloe rushes home to save her pets but arrives too late. She is joined by Kevin, who has escaped from prison with help from his dogs and talking parrot, Waddlesworth. Upon finding a ticket for the Orient Express to Paris dropped by LePelt, Kevin and Chloe attempt and fail to stop Cruella and LePelt, but Oddball and Waddlesworth pursue their enemies secretly. In Paris, Kevin and Chloe save some of the captive puppies, but they are seen and locked in the cellar just as the puppies flee. Cruella goes after the puppies alone. Alonzo, when scolded beyond his patience and had enough of being abused, defeats LePelt and frees Kevin and Chloe and they give chase to a bakery, where the puppies and Kevins dogs imprison Cruella in an immense cake. She and LePelt are thereupon arrested. Kevin and Chloe are personally awarded the remnants of Cruellas fortune by Alonzo himself and Oddballs coat finally develops spots.
