Glenn Griffin (Humphrey Bogart) is the leader of a trio of escaped convicts who invade the Hilliard familys suburban home in Indianapolis and hold four members of the family hostage. There they await the arrival of a package from Griffins girlfriend, that contains funds to aid the three fugitives in their escape. Police organize a statewide manhunt for the escapees and eventually discover the distraught familys plight. Griffin menaces and torments the Hilliards and threatens to kill them. Later, the unfortunate refuse collector George Patterson (Walter Baldwin), who happens upon the situation after noticing Griffins car in the garage, is murdered in order to silence him, after being forced to drive into the country. Finally the father, Daniel Hilliard (Fredric March), after convincing law enforcement personnel that their plan to storm the residence is too risky for his family, plays a trick on Griffin using an unloaded handgun. He forces the convict out of the house with the outlaws own weapon trained on him. Griffin is subsequently machine-gunned to death, when he hurls the firearm at a police spotlight and tries to make a break for it.
