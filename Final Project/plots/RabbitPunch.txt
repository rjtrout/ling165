A boxing match begins between the Champ "Battling McGook" and the Challenger "Dyspectic McBlaster". The Champ immediately knocks out the Challenger with a few punches. The Champ, instead of letting the match end, picks the Challenger back up and continues punching him in various ways. Bugs Bunny, displeased with this, heckles the Champ. The Champ, after hearing Bugs, throws him into the ring for a boxing match. At first, Bugs, having no experience, is punched back to his corner by the Champ. After this happens three times, Bugs begins using strategy to win. Afterward, the two begin cheating and the match changes from boxing to wrestling. The match ends at round 110 when the Champ ties Bugs to a railroad and tries to run him over with a train. The film breaks just as Bugs is about to be run over. Bugs walks onto a white screen and tells the audience that the film is unable to continue, but it didnt break, revealing a pair of scissors.
