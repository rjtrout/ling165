Mr. Belvedere is on a lecture tour on the topic "How to be young, though eighty." He wonders if there is any point in living to be eighty himself after overhearing four residents of the Church of John old age home talk about their ailments. He decides to embark on an investigation at the home. When he goes to see Bishop Daniels about gaining entry, he is mistaken for Oliver Erwenter, who had applied for admission, but died at the age of seventy-seven. He does not correct the mistake since only the aged are admitted. After encountering initial skepticism, he has the residents of the facility feeling younger, aided by youth pills from "Tibet" (actually simply sugar pills he concocts at the local drugstore), much to the disapproval of the well-meaning but staid Rev. Charles Watson, the person in charge of the old age home. Belvedere also helps Harriet Tripp, Watsons assistant, with her romance problem: the reverend does not see that she is in love with him. With the help of Emmett, the lecture tour companys advance man, Belvedere makes preparations for a church bazaar to raise funds for the poverty-stricken place. Watson soon discovers his newest charges true identity, but keeps the information to himself after seeing how much good Belvedere has accomplished. However, reporters finally uncover his deception, and the disillusioned senior citizens revert to their cheerless routine. Belvedere manages to convince them that they are only as old as they think they are. Watson also sees the light and proposes to Miss Tripp. His work done, and convinced it is worth his while to live to eighty, Belvedere leaves to resume his lecture tour.
