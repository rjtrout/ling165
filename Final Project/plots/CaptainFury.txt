In the 1840s, Captain Michael Fury (Brian Aherne) is an Irish patriot transported to New South Wales for his political involvement. He is farmed out as an servant to Arnold Trist, a cruel land owner who uses whipping to keep discipline. He is accompanied by fellow convicts Blackie, Coughy and Bertie. Fury escapes from prison and meets Jeannette Dupre, the daughter of strict Mennonite Francois Dupre. Fury discovers that Trist is trying to drive settlers from the area to take over their land. Fury organises the settlers to take action against Trist. He returns to prison to recruit convicts to help settlers. Trists men attack the Bailey ranch. Fury, helped by Blackie, Coughy and Bertie, oppose them. Jeanette begins to fall in love with Fury. Her father forbids her to see him, so she runs away. Dupre then tells Trist where Fury can be found. Trist double crosses Dupre and imprisons him. Fury and his men narrowly escape an ambush from Trists men. Dupres house is burnt down and a charred body is discovered in the ruins. Fury is arrested for Dupres murder and sentenced to hang. However Blackie hears Dupre calling from his cell, rescues him and presents him to the Governor. Trist is exposed. He attempts to escape but is shot by a dying Coughy. The Governor grands Fury a pardon and places Blackie and Bertie in his custody.
