Bob is pardoned by the governor but receives a reward for just $500. He spends the money on an engagement ring. Harry Kane, who manages Cynthys career, books Bob for stage appearances in which he re-enacts the shooting of Jesse. He is booed by audiences and mocked in public for his cowardly deed. Bob goes to Colorado to try prospecting and runs into Kelley, who is rejecting offers to become Creedes town marshal. Bob wakes up one day to find both Kelley and the engagement ring missing. Cynthy arrives just as Kelley returns, having captured the rings thief. Kelley is disappointed when Cynthy accepts Bobs proposal, so he accepts the job as marshal.

Frank makes sure that Bob learns of this, knowing Bob will make the fatal mistake of confronting Kelley face to face. In the street, Bob draws on Kelley and is shot dead.
