Three men escape from a prison garrison in South Africa, 1837. As the encounter a tribe of Boers led by Willem Prinsboo who are trekking into the countrys interior, one of the fugitives, Steve Bates, a British soldier, immediately develops a romantic interest in Willems beautiful granddaughter, Francina. Bates and his fellow escapees, his African friend Nzobo and a brutal criminal, Harry Carter, help hold off a raid by Zulu warriors, but Willem is badly wounded. To the fury of Barent Beyer, a man who loves Francina, her grandfathers last wish before he dies is that Bates now become the groups leader. The jealous Barent sets an ambush to kill Bates, but before he can, he is felled by a Zulu spear. Carter, too, ends up dead, Bates avenging an assault on Francina. What remains of the group is able to go back to Francinas farm in peace after the Zulu chief is killed in battle by Nzobo.
