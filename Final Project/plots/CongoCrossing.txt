Congotanga, West Africa, has no extradition laws; the government is controlled by foreign gangsters, headed by Carl Rittner (Tonio Selwart). The latest plane from Europe carries Louise Whitman (Virginia Mayo), (fleeing a French murder charge), and Mannering (Raymond Bailey), who pays resident hit man OConnell (Michael Pate) to kill her. Through a chain of circumstances Louise, OConnell, and heroic surveyor David Carr (George Nader) end up alone in the jungle on Carrs mission to determine the true border of Congotanga... in which Rittner is keenly interested.
