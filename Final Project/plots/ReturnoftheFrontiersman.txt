At least until a fight breaks out between his grown son, Logan, and a man named Kearney whos been wounded by one of Logans bullets. Newspaper editor Larrabee explains to the sheriff what happened. Larrabee was accused of cheating at cards by Kearney, who drew a gun on him. But because the editor was unarmed, Logan stepped in and shot the gun from Kearneys hand. Sam believes the fair thing is to give Logan and Kearney each 10 days in jail. Kearney is livid, though, accusing the sheriff of favorable bias toward his son. Later that day at Kearneys ranch, Ryan, a ranch hand, sees Logan standing over Kearneys dead body. A posse is formed. Logan runs into a doctors daughter, Janie Martin, and explains his situation. A bank is robbed and the banker shot by a man fitting Logans description, riding off on a pinto, which is what Logan rides. Larrabee helps him get away. Janie spots a man in similar garb on a pinto and realizes Logans been telling the truth about being innocent. Sam goes to help his son and discovers Larrabee is behind the killing and robbery. Janie is held hostage, but Logan and his father, fighting side by side, save the day.
