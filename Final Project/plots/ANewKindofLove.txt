A womanizing American reporter assigned in Paris (Paul Newman) mistakes a cynical fashion copycat designer (Joanne Woodward) for a prostitute after she receives a makeover. He decides to interview her for a series of articles, then falls in love with her. The girl goes along with it, first out of revenge as he snubbed her during a past encounter, then out of feelings of her own.
