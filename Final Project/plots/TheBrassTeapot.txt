The movie follows John (Michael Angarano) and Alice (Juno Temple), a down on their luck couple that comes across a magical brass teapot capable of providing them with money. The only catch is that they must experience pain in order for the teapot to provide. They must then decide what they are willing to do (and what they are willing to suffer through) in order to gain financial security.
