Riley Wade hates his gunfighter father, Jacob, for deserting Rileys mother, who then committed suicide. Jacob rides to Red Bluff hoping to reconcile with his son, unaware that King Fisher holds a grudge and intends to shoot down Jacob, first chance. Riley accompanies his father on the trail, setting their family ranch ablaze first, never letting him out of his sight. Jacobs sight, meantime, is fading; he is slowly going blind, a fact he hides from his son. Riley refuses to forgive his father until old friend Ben Ryerson explains to him that Jacob didnt desert his mother at all. King comes to town with his men. Riley, aware for the first time of his fathers failing vision, acts as his eyes in directing Jacob where to shoot. Kings men die and he tries to sneak away, but he and Jacob end up in a showdown anyway and kill one another. Jacob dies in his sons arms.
