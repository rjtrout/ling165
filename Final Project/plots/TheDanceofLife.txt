Burlesque comic Ralph "Skid" Johnson (Skelly), and specialty dancer Bonny Lee King (Carroll), end up together on a cold, rainy night at a train station, after she fails an audition and he complains about her treatment by the impresario of the show and quits. They decide to team up and apply for work with a much better show on "the big wheel". The two things they have in life are dancing and each other, if she could only keep him away from the booze, long enough to keep dancing. A tragi-comedic, burlesque version of All That Jazz, from an earlier era.
