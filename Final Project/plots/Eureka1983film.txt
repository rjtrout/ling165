Arctic prospector Jack McCann (Gene Hackman), after 15 years of solitary searching, becomes one of the worlds wealthiest men when he literally falls into a mountain of gold in 1925. Twenty years later in 1945, he lives in luxury on a Caribbean island that he owns. But his wealth brings him no peace of mind as he copes with Helen (Jane Lapotaire), his bored, alcoholic wife; Tracy (Theresa Russell), his headstrong daughter who has married Claude Van Horn (Rutger Hauer) a dissolute, philandering social-climber; and Miami mobsters led by Aurelio DAmato (Mickey Rourke), who want his island to build a casino. His life is entangled with the obsessions of those around him with greed, power, and debauchery against a background of occult symbolism. When Jack is brutally murdered by unseen mob associates, his son-in-law, Claude, is arrested for the crime and put on trial, which takes place during most of the second part of the film. With circumstantial evidence and due to Jacks long list of enemies, the prosecution fails to prove its case against Claude, and he is acquitted. Claude leaves the island with Tracy shortly thereafter, and Jack McCanns murder remains unsolved.
