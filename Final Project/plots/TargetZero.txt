During a Korean War skirmish, a United Nations relief worker, Ann Galloway (Peggie Castle), is injured and her assistant killed. As the Communist forces take over the region, Ann accompanies a patrol led by Lt. Tom Flagler (Richard Conte), a soldiers soldier, admired by his men, as they try to rejoin Easy Company and other allied troops. The British sergeant named Kensemmit (Richard Wyler) bears a grudge against all fellow soldiers and is particularly contemptuous of Flagler, as well as possibly interested in Ann romantically. SFC Vince Gaspari (Charles Bronson) vouches for Tom completely as a born leader, although he acknowledges Anns conclusion that Tom cares about nothing else than his military duty to be true. The patrol discovers that Easy Company has been massacred, leaving Tom discouraged. But under orders to hold the region until help can arrive, Tom and his men fight off North Korean foes. In victory, he also comes to realize that Ann represents the very kind of thing he has been fighting for all along.
