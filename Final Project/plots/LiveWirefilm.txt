When a Senator is killed in an explosion, the FBI investigates. The agent in charge is bomb expert Danny ONeill (Pierce Brosnan), who is separated from his wife Terry (Lisa Eilbacher) (due to the accidental drowning of their only child in their pool) and behaving very erratically. Initially the investigation does not reveal the kind of explosive used or even what was used to detonate it. Eventually it is learned that terrorists led by Mikhael Rashid (Ben Cross) have developed an "invisible" liquid explosive which is activated within the human body (by stomach acid). It also does not help that they have to report to Senator Traveres (Ron Silver), the man whom Terry is having an affair with and whom Danny also assaulted. Later, another senator is killed while riding in a limousine; the limo being driven by one of Rashids henchmen. The henchman is subsequently struck by a moving car, taken into custody and brought into court, and since he is now considered a risk by Rashid, the judge in the case is slipped the liquid and she spontaneously explodes; the witness is subsequently killed, though ONeill discovers the cause of the explosions - the chemically enhanced water in the judges pitcher. It becomes obvious that the next target is Senator Traveres, so ONeill, concerned that Terry may become collateral damage, trails his every move. At a fundraiser, Traveres is targeted by Rashids main henchman, Al-red (Tony Plana), disguised as a clown. ONeill alerts the public to the bombs presence, and in desperation, Al-red ingests some of the infected liquid. ONeill subdues Al-red and gets him away from party in a wheelchair just before he explodes. In the aftermath, ONeill and Terry finally reconcile. Aware that Traveres is still not safe, ONeill infiltrates the senators heavily guarded mansion, at a very convenient time as it is being overrun by the terrorists. ONeill concocts a cornucopia of home-made weapons, even building bombs using fertilizer found in the kitchen cabinet. All the terrorists are killed except for Rashid, who holds Terry hostage in front of him and Traveres. Rashid swallows some of the liquid, sealing his fate but intending to bring them all down with him. ONeill manages to free Terry and send her to safe ground. He and Traveres however are cornered and are thus subsequently forced to jump from the third floor due to Rashids explosion. Traveres lands on a wrought-iron fence which impales and kills him, though ONeill survives. A year later, he has a second child with Terry.
