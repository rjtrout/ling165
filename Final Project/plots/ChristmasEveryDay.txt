The film is set in the fictional town of Greenwood Falls, Virginia (just outside Washington, D.C.) and stars Erik von Detten as Billy Jackson, a selfish teenager forced to relive the same Christmas every day. Billys sister (Yvonne Zima) wishes that it was Christmas every day, and thereafter he has to keep repeating Christmas Day until he realizes the true meaning of the holiday season. The movie also stars Robert Hays and Bess Armstrong as Billys parents. Billy finds the entire experience to be a nightmare. "My life is on rewind," he moans. Each December 25, he must face the school bully (Tyler Mason Buckalew); he must also get involved in his grocer fathers dispute with his fat-cat uncle (Robert Curtis Brown) who wants to build a mega-store and ruin the local merchants. Billys Christmas pageant prank goes horribly awry, and a destitute old lady needs a bag of food, but he forgets to bring it to her.
