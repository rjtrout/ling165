The movie picks up where My Friend Irma left off, Al (John Lund) is still trying to promote Steves (Dean Martin) career. Eventually, he gets booked to a local TV station and is spotted by a movie producer. He is offered a contract and Steve, as well as the rest of the gang, Irma (Marie Wilson), Jane (Diana Lynn) and Seymour (Jerry Lewis), all head to Hollywood. The trip ends suddenly when the producer is discovered to be an escaped lunatic. Al tries to set things straight by taking the gang to Las Vegas to work at a casino, but things arent as they seem. Irma causes havoc by wrecking a rigged roulette wheel, and she gets kidnapped and held for ransom until Al can raise $50,000. Meanwhile, Seymour, dressed as an Indian brave, locates Irma and rescues her. The publicity received during the entire incident brings another movie offer... this time for Irma and Seymour.
