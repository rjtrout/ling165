Jimi Lazer, front-man guitarist of the up-and-coming rock band LAZER US, gets wind of a magical guitar. He pays a visit to the Hex who reveals the steep price of such a deal. Realizing she wonâ€™t let him back out, he now lives under a curse. Jimi takes the guitar and disappears. No one hears from him again. Twenty-seven long years pass. Jimis old band manager, Freedom, arrives in a beat-up old van. He tells Jimi that he has had a dream where Jimi was playing music with the Man in Black. He and Jimi set out on a mad-cap chase to re-assemble the magical guitar before the Guitar Hunter does. With the help of his former bandmates, Righty and Red, and a new face, Zmoothie, they set out to break the curse once and for all.
