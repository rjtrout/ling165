The Stooges are tricked into becoming stowaways by their neighbor Mr. Borscht (Gene Roth), a spy for a fictitious USSR-like country. Stranded on a freighter on the high seas, and sustained by eating salami, they discover that Borscht has concealed stolen microfilm in watermelons. After a wild chase, the boys overtake Borscht and recover the microfilm.
