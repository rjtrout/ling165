Estelle Rolfes (Anne Bancroft) social activism and quick temper cause a lot of inconvenience for her grown son Gilbert (Ron Silver), who often must go to a New York City jail precinct to pay her bail. Gilbert is willing to go to great lengths for his mother, though, after a doctors examination diagnoses a terminal brain tumor. Estelles last wish is to meet the movie star she has idolized all her life, the reclusive Greta Garbo. Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher) sympathizes, but when husband Gilbert abandons his job to devote his days to the search for Garbo, she cant take it anymore and abandons him. An aspiring actress in Gilberts office, Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), takes a liking to Gilbert and a romantic interest seems entirely possible, but first comes Gilberts increasingly futile search for a famous woman who does not care to be found. Leads eventually take Gilbert to an elderly actress, Elizabeth, who once knew Garbo, and to an aging paparazzo, Angelo, who is somewhat acquainted with Garbos habits and whereabouts, but neither is able to get Gilbert to her. Estelles estranged husband, Walter, visits the hospital to say an emotional goodbye. With little time to spare, Gilbert is finally able to meet Garbo face-to-face and explain his mothers situation. Without a word, Garbo goes straight to Estelles hospital room for a bedside chat, where Estelle herself ends up doing all of the talking. Gilbert is at peace with how his mothers life came to an end. As he strolls with Jane in the park, she and others are startled by the sight of Garbo walking by. Even more startling to Jane is when Garbo catches a glimpse of Gilbert and says hello.
