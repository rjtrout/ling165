The story centers around Harvey Miller (Jerry Lewis), whose father was a famous golf pro. He wanted Harvey to follow in his footsteps, but poor Harvey is afraid of crowds. Instead, at the advice of his fianc√©e Lisa (Barbara Bates), Harvey becomes a golf instructor. Lisas brother Joe (Dean Martin) becomes Harveys first client and becomes good enough to start playing in tournaments, with Harvey tagging along as his caddie. Donna Reed plays the wealthy socialite who Dean wins over. Joes success goes to his head and he begins to treat Harvey poorly. They begin to quarrel and cause a disruption at a tournament, so Joe is disqualified. However, a talent agent witnesses the comical spectacle and advises that they go into show business. Harvey conquers his fear and they become successful entertainers. At the end, Harvey and Joe meet up with another comedy team who look just like them: Martin and Lewis!
