Sam Ward and Logan Keliher were once brothers in arms in the Texas Rangers. When both left the force, Ward turned outlaw and is angry at Keliher for marrying his former wife and adopting his child whilst Ward was imprisoned for his crimes. Ward escapes from prison and forms a gang to rob a bank in Kelihers town with Ward planning to kill Keliher after the robbery. Keliher foils the robbery with Ward the only survivor of his gang. Ward escapes with the loot though he is wounded by Keliher. Keliher links up with a posse and uses his knowledge of Wards ways to track him down. Once Ward is captured and the bank money recovered, several members of the posse debate whether they should kill Ward and his girlfriend Susan and keep the bank money for themselves. Their plans are interrupted by an Apache war party.
