Dorothy "Dot" Burton (Faye Emerson) is a member of a gang of bank robbers. Using her femininity and a cute dog provided her by her male cohorts who dognapped him, she is able to enter a bank before opening time, leaving the door open and the bank guard holding her dog, thus enabling a successful robbery. When police interfere with the getaway she faints and proclaims her innocence, however the police have strong doubts as "her" dog wont come to her and has a different name on his collar than what she calls him. After she confesses to her part in the robbery, she is sent to womens prison where she makes enemies of fellow inmates seeking Dots share of the money.
