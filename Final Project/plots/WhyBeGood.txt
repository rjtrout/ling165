Peabody Jr. (Neil Hamilton) and his friends prepare to frolic into the night before he must begin work the following day at his fathers department store. Before departing, Peabody Sr. (Edward Martindale) lectures his son about the women of the day and that all the cuties at the store are off limits. In the meantime, Pert Kelly (Colleen Moore), after winning a dance contest is being wooed by gentlemen of questionable character. All parties end up having a wild time at "The Boiler" where Pert catches the eye of Peabody Jr. who gives her a ride home and schedules a date for the following night. Pert is tardy to work as she was up until 3 and must report to the personnel office where she is surprised to find Peabody Jr. working. Peabody Sr. is there, figures out whats going on, and terminates Perts employment. Peabody Jr. must wait several hours past the scheduled date before he can talk to Pert and explain he did not do the firing. They schedule another date. Lavish gifts arrive for Pert to wear to the next date. She gets lectured by Pa Kelly (John St. Polis) about the lack of virtues of the "modern" man. Similarly Peabody Jr. is again lectured about the "modern" woman by Peabody Sr. On the next date, Peabody Jr. has devised a test of Perts virtue. When he tries to push her past her personal limits, she protests, in the process passing his test with ease. They are married that night, and they arrive back home to prove her virtue to Peabody Sr. who now cannot refute it.
