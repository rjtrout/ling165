Colonel Cooper (David Carradine) is a U.S. Airborne commando who comes to Vietnam with a special mission to liberate imprisoned American soldiers. He gets caught in a North Vietnamese POW camp where there are other airbornes as well as regular soldiers. Action is set at the end of the war and he, as the highest-ranking officer in the POW camp, is to be sent to Hanoi and prosecuted by the North Vietnamese. Camp commander Vinh (Mako Iwamatsu) gets an order to send him to court but instead of obeying it, he offers Cooper a deal - he will help him get to the American sector and then Cooper, in return, would help him immigrate to the USA, where Vinh has family. Cooper promptly disregards his proposition, as hes a tough soldier who would rather sacrifice his own life than help the enemy. However Vinh is persistent persuading him, threatening that if hell not accept his deal, then all of the fellow prisoners from his camp will die. Given that threat Cooper reconsiders Vinhs offer, and accepts the deal, but under one condition - all of the camp prisoners must go with them. Vinh, being short of time (as Hanoi set deadline for sending Cooper to court) OKs the plan and so they leave camp in column of two jeeps and a truck (prisoners are hidden in a tank truck while Cooper goes with Vinh in a jeep). Their journey wont be without obstacles as they need to go through zones controlled by The North Vietnamese, and through the jungle wilderness.
