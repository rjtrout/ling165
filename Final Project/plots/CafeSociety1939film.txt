The wealthy Christopher "Chris" West is a member of the cafe society. To win a bet, she marries reporter Crick OBannon, who believes Chris married him for love. When Crick overhears Chris telling one of her friends about the bet, he decides to get even by writing a story about her betrayal. In response, Chriss grandfather, Christopher West Sr, apologizes for his granddaughters behavior and requests that the couple live together until the divorce is quietly finalized in order to avoid a scandal. Because he dislikes Chris society friends, Crick refuses and lives apart from her. While still married, Chris and Crick constantly argue. When she notices that Crick is close to nightclub singer Bells Browne, Chris becomes jealous but resigned that Crick prefers Bells. She decides to sail for Europe, but is surprised when Crick appears on the ship, having been alerted to Chriss departure by her grandfather. Crick explains that Bells is only a friend and Chris returns to shore with him. However, Chriss jealousy resurfaces upon seeing Bells singing at the club that night and she persuades the clubs owner to fire Bells. When the bartender, Bill, calls Chris out on her brash behavior, a contrite Chris asks that Bells be rehired and admits to Crick that she has been an awful fool.
