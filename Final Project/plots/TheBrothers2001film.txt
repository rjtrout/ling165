When he finds out that Denise once dated his father, his new outlook on love takes a turn. Brian, an attorney, realizes that his chronic womanizing is catching up to him in ways he didnt imagine when a former lover (also the judge in a case he is currently working) sends him to jail. He makes a vow to not date African-American women because he believes that they carry unnecessary drama. Brian is working to gain custody of his younger brother who currently lives in a affection-less household with his mother. Derrick, the only married member of the group, loves his wife (Jones) and daughter, but is struggling with the idea of his wifes not giving him the type of sex he desires.

In addition to wanting more in the bedroom, Derrick is trying to convince his wife to let his ailing mother live in their home.
