In one of Charlie Chaplins "park comedies," another tramp is causing havoc. He attempts to pickpocket Charlie, but finds nothing in his pockets. Meanwhile, Charlie stealthily goes through the pickpockets jacket and steals a cigarette and his matches. Meanwhile two couples are having romantic interludes on separate benches. The crooked tramp steals one girls handbag, but swiftly loses it to Charlie when he tries to pickpocket him a second time. Charlie rescues a hot dog vendor from a thug, but deftly takes a few of the sausages with his cane. Charlie sells the stolen handbag to the other male suitor. A suspicious policemen observes the goings-on and the men realize the bag is stolen and pass it among each other. Finally Charlie presents it as a gift to the other female and receives an affectionate embrace. The bags original owner becomes angry with her suitor for permitting her bag to be stolen. The suitor is rejected and reacts hyper-dramatically. He intends to drown himself in the parks lake and asks Charlie to assist him. He presents his behind as a target and Charlie gladly kicks him into the pond. Shortly thereafter he also kicks the other girls suitor into the pond along with the park policeman.
