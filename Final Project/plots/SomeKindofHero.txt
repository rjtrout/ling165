Eddie Keller is a U.S. Army conscript private who was captured while defecating. He was held in a POW Camp for years. Due to his resistance in signing a confession admitting to committing war crimes he ends up being one of the last POWs to be brought home from Vietnam. Keller endures several years of torture and deprivation at the hands of the North Vietnamese Army. He finally relents to signing a "confession" admitting to war crimes to save the life of his cell mate. Having returned home, Eddie finds the world has moved on without him. His wife has fallen in love with someone new, and had a daughter, just after he became a POW. His mother has suffered a stroke, and requires constant (and expensive) medical attention. Eddie is initially called a hero when he is finally released, but when his signed confession is discovered (and no one can track down the other prisoner he tried to save), his veterans benefits are suspended by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pending further investigation. Eddie tries to reintegrate into society, but finds himself stopped at every turn. The Army refuses to help, he cannot find a job, and he is running out of options. The only bright spot in his life is Toni, a high-priced prostitute who picks Eddie up at a bar. Despite Tonis profession, the two begin a romance. While trying to secure a loan, Eddie is witness to a bank robbery. He begins to plot a way to gain the funds he needs to provide for his mother, and also to avenge himself on a system that abandoned him in Vietnam, then turned him into a traitor. Eddie plans to hold up a bank, but fails repeatedly in his efforts to embark on a life of crime. Eventually, he succeeds in stealing a briefcase full of bonds, which he arranges to sell to a mobster for a large sum of cash. The mobsters plan to kill Eddie and take the bonds. Eddie turns the tables on the mobsters, escaping with the cash and the bonds with Toni.
