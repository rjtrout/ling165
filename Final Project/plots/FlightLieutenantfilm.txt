World War I combat pilot Sam Doyle has developed a drinking problem. In 1932, he causes the death of his co-pilot and has his license revoked. A single parent, he leaves young Danny behind with a guardian and goes off to South America to find gainful employment. He leaves money to the dead co-pilots widow and daughter, but the dead mans brother, Thompson, wants revenge. Danny grows up to be an expert pilot. Thompson, now a major, becomes his superior officer. Neither has any knowledge of their shared history, even after Danny falls in love with Thompsons niece, Susie, and proposes marriage. Doyle returns, re-enlists and learns Danny is scheduled to test a new jet that has a design flaw. Doyle changes places with Danny at the last minute, flies and crashes the plane, saving future lives while sacrificing his own.
