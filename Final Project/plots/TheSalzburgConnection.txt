After a chest is brought up from the bottom of an Austrian lake, the diver, Richard Bryant (Patrick Jordan), is found murdered. Bill Mathison (Barry Newman) is an American lawyer on vacation in Austria. He stops by a photography shop to meet with a man who is compiling a book of photographs of Austrian Lakes, as a favor to the publisher, and meets the photographers wife Anna (Anna Karina). The photographer has disappeared, and this begins a chase to find the missing chest, which contains a list of former members of the Nazi party who could be embarrassingly connected to current US politics. An American woman, Elissa Lang (Karen Jensen), pretending to be a recent college graduate on a European tour is also after the chest, on behalf of an underground group of remaining Nazis. They all end up fighting for their lives, as well as the possession of the chest along with a group of CIA agents.
