Danny, an acclaimed singer and songwriter, falls in love with a socialite girl who is just playing around. He doesnt realize that his girl-Friday is the one he really loves until it is almost too late. Although he is awestruck by high society, he overhears the girls admission that she is stringing him along just in time to avoid marriage. Danny is notably Jewish, and among the issues the movie raises is his temptation to assimilate into the larger culture. The film is an adaptation of a play that riffed on the real-life relationship between songwriter Irving Berlin and Long Island socialite Ellin Mackay, which was all over the gossip columns in the late 1920s. Mackays millionaire father cut her off and did not speak to her for years because, after a long courtship, she married Berlin, who was Jewish. (Unlike the fickle debutante in the film, Mackay stayed with Berlin, and their marriage lasted over sixty years.) The film is played against a theatrical backdrop, and contains many songs and production numbers.
