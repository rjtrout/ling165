Los Angeles police detective Jerry McMullen (Larry J. Blake) stops a car driven by lawyer John Morland (John Eldredge) to tell him of client Red Baileys (Douglas Fowley) jail escape. Shortly thereafter, an armed Bailey flags down Morlands car, which police find wrecked, its drivers face beyond recognition. McMullen breaks the news to the lawyers wife, Catherine (Jean Rogers), who identifies a ring on the body as her husbands. She soon becomes a suspect. Morlands law partner ONeil (Robert Shayne) believes that Catherine and district attorney Conroy (Richard Travis) have been having a secret affair, while his doctor says Morland once swallowed poison that his wife tried to give him. Conroy is found at the Morlands weekend getaway cabin, which is maintained by a caretaker named Willis (Leonard Strong). The evidence of an affair grows until Catherine is arrested and Conroy resigns as DA. Bailey, meantime, resurfaces with Marian Gordon (Louise Currie), a girlfriend. McMullen has a phone tapped and follows them. He learns that Bailey was hidden by Morland at the cabin, but then they had a fight and Bailey knocked him cold. Catherine is released. She finds ONeil dead at the lodge. Her husband, Morland, is alive. He has been behind this all along, going so far as to fake being poisoned to frame his wife. The body in the car is the caretakers. It is a diabolical plan, but McMullens on the case.
