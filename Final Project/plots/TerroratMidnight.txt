Rick Rickards, a cop, lends his car to Susan Lang, his fianc√©e. She accidentally runs into a night watchman riding a bicycle. An eyewitness named Speegle suggests she flee the scene before the watchman regains consciousness. Susan takes the car to an auto shop run by Fred Hill, who recognizes it as Ricks vehicle.

Speegle shows up at Susans home, hoping to blackmail her for $500. He finds out her boyfriend is a cop and scrams. Susan is told by Hill that he needs more time to repair her car, Hill now realizing that the cars been involved in an accident, information he can use. Helen, seeing her husband and Susan together, believes he is seeing another woman and, in a fit of drunken jealousy, gets into a truck and runs down Hill, killing him. Susan ends up suspected of the crime. Helen, in a panic and eager to leave town, goes to Hanlon and Mascotti threatening to tell everything she knows unless they pay her $5,000. They kill her instead. Susan finds the body and becomes the prime suspect in two murders now. Rick offers to resign from the force, but is urged to stay on it and solve the case. He and another officer end up in a car chase, forcing Hanlon and Mascotti off the road, arresting one and shooting the other. Susan is cleared of all charges and Rick takes her home.
