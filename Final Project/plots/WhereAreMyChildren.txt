Richard Walton, a district attorney, is presented with an obscenity case: A medical practitioner, Dr. Homer, has been arrested for distributing indecent birth control literature. On the stand, Dr. Homer makes a strong case for legalizing contraception. He recounts three incidents from his medical practice, each shown in a brief flashback: children are exposed to violent abuse in a family riddled with alcoholism; an impoverished family is unable to provide adequate medical care for their sick children; and a single mother, abandoned by her male lover, commits suicide with her young infant. Meanwhile, Richards wife, Edith, has been keeping a secret from him for many years: she has been seeing a doctor, one Herman Malfit, who performs abortions so that her busy social life will not be interrupted by the inconvenience of pregnancy. She suggests it as an option for her friend Mrs. William Carlo, who is with child. Mrs. Carlo has the abortion. The Waltons receive two new guests in their house almost simultaneously: Edith Waltons neer-do-well younger brother, and their maids young daughter, Lillian. Smitten by the brothers advances, the maids daughter is seduced and soon finds herself pregnant. She is taken to Dr. Malfit and then abandoned by the boy after the operation goes wrong. Making her way back to the Walton mansion, she collapses and dies from the botched abortion. Following Malfits arrest and trial, Richard Walton examines the doctors ledgers and realized that his wife and many of her friends are listed as having received personal services. He returns home, furious, to find them lunching at his home. He banishes his wifes friends, saying I should bring you to trial for manslaughter! and confronts Edith with the cry, where are my children? She is overcome with remorse. As the years pass, the couple must contend with a lonely, childless life, full of longing for the family they might have had.
