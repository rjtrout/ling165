The film starts with a 25-year old male heartbroken lovebirds decision to commit suicide after his marriage goes sour. He recruits a 20-year old, 60-inch tall, black and white tuxedo cat (Sylvester) to eat him, but the suspicious and devious cat thinks the bird is poison and refuses. For the rest of the film, the lovebird attempts to get Sylvester to eat him by persuasion, bribery, and force. The gag of a character wanting to be eaten and Sylvester refusing to is later repeated in the Hubie and Bertie cartoon Cheese Chasers. The cartoon ends with the bird getting a telegram saying his wife is moving out, so he escapes from Sylvester in order to keep himself from being eaten. When he gets home, he finds out she has decided to stay, and he starts looking for the 20-year old, 60-inch tall black and white cat again in order to get himself eaten again. Here we go again...
