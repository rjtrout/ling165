The film follows the misadventures of free-spirited Mary, who spends all of her time dancing in clubs and throwing house parties. When she is arrested for illegally charging attendees at an underground rave, she calls upon her godmother, Judy Lindendorf, to bail her out. So Mary can repay the loan, Judy employs her as a clerk at the library where she works. Mary reluctantly begins her new job while striking up a romance with Lebanese street vendor and aspiring teacher Mustafa. She gradually becomes very good at her job, in particular by mastering the Dewey Decimal System, but she gets fired after having sex with Mustafa in the library. With no money to pay the rent, she and her roommate Leo, a club DJ, are evicted from her apartment. During one of her parties, Mary has a fight with Mustafa and takes drugs to forget. Her friend Nigel tries to take advantage of her, but she fights him off. The next day, she decides to get her life in order and become a librarian. She invites Judy over to talk, but when they arrive Mary discovers to her horror that her friends have thrown her a surprise birthday party, complete with a male stripper. Mary tells a skeptical Judy that she has finally found her calling in life, and Mustafa and Leo tell Judy that Mary used her library science skills to help them with their careers. Impressed, Judy gives Mary her job back, and joins her god-daughter in dancing with her friends.
