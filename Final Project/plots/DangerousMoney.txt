Aboard an ocean liner in the South Pacific, US Treasury agent Scott Pearson confidentially asks Charlie Chan for help. There have been two attempts on his life. Chan rescues him from a third, but not the fourth (a knife in the back). The captain asks Chan to complete the dead mans mission and find out who is responsible for the recent surfacing of counterfeit dollars and stolen art. Chan declines, citing urgent business in Australia, but sets out to find the murderer.
