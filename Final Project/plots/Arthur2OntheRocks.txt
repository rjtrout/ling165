Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) is still rich and still drinks too much, but he and Linda (Liza Minnelli) are now happily married. The one thing missing in their life is a child. Seeking revenge, billionaire Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott), the father of Susan Johnson (Cynthia Sikes), the wealthy woman whom he jilted at the altar, takes control of his inheritance, leaving him broke and homeless. Susan wants him back and is willing to break up his marriage if thats what it takes. Arthur tries to sober up to rise up to the occasion and find a job, knowing his financial plight could ruin any chance he and Linda have of adopting a baby. She assures a representative from the adoption agency that, despite his drinking, he would make a good father. Through an elaborate scheme, he plots to get even with the Johnsons and get his money back. In the end, he not only is able to get his money back and adopt a child, but Linda discovers shes pregnant.
