Lively teen Joan Lyons (Virginia Weidler) and her best friend, Patricia Drew (Jean Porter), are dedicated autograph seekers who run around New York City attempting to meet celebrities. Deceived by trouble-making governess Miss Featherstone (Agnes Moorehead), Joan is distracted from her star-chasing by concerns over her parents marriage. This leads Joan to hire a muscle man named Dr. Hercules (John Carroll) to flirt with her mother, which only results in more misunderstandings.
