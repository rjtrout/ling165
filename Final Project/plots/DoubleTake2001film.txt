Daryl Chase (Jones) is a successful investment banker who handles international accounts for a major New York City firm. Chase discovers to his surprise that one of his biggest clients, a company from Mexico, is actually a front for a cartel of drug smugglers; he realizes too late that hes been framed for money laundering and the murder of two cops, and is now wanted by the FBI. Chase is soon approached by a CIA agent, who thinks Chases relationship with the Mexican drug kingpins might prove useful, but when his local contact disappears, Chase has to make his way to Mexico in order to save his skin and hopefully clear his name. Needing a new identity to get out of town and across the border, Chase obtains a stolen passportâ€” and soon learns the man whose name hes using is in even deeper trouble with the law than himself. With nowhere else to turn, Chase asks streetwise hustler Freddy Tiffany (Griffin) (in reality, an undercover FBI agent) to help him get out of town; Chase pretends to be Freddy, while Tiffany will pose as a businessman like Chase. However, Chase finds out Tiffany isnt the man he thought he was, and that his sticky situation is even more perilous and fraught with secrets than he imagined.
