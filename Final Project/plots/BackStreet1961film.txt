Wealthy department-store heir Paul Saxon has a romantic fling with a Nebraska dress-shop owner, Rae Smith, who breaks it off when she discovers he is married. Rae moves to New York to become a fashion designer, then on to Rome to become the famed Dalians partner in a salon. Paul continues to woo her, explaining that his alcoholic wife Liz wont grant him a divorce and is unstable, having tried to commit suicide. Her resistance lowered, Rae becomes the lover of Paul, meeting secretly with him at a house near Paris that he buys. Pauls son learns of the affair and demands that Rae stop seeing his father. Liz makes a public scene humiliating Rae at a charity fashion show featuring her designs, purchasing the closing creation, a wedding gown, for $10,000. As a drunken Liz leaves the house to attend a party, Paul confronts her. He gets into the car with her, and as the two argue they fight over the keys in the ignition. The car crashes instantly killing Liz and leaving Paul critically paralyzed in the hospital. Paul dies from his injuries, but not before insisting his son call Rae so he can tell her he loves her. Rae, Paul Jr. and his sister Caroline are left alone with their grief. The last scene shows her sitting by the window of the home he bought for her. She was looking at his picture and a knock came on the door. It was Pauls son with his little sister and the movie ended with Rae with her arms around them.
