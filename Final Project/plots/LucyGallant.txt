While traveling from New York City to Mexico, the stylish Lucy Gallant is stranded by a storm in fictitious New City, Texas, where rancher Casey Cole helps find her suitable lodging. The public reaction to her fashions persuades Lucy to sell the contents of her trousseau, and she decides to stay and open a dress shop. Lucy lives at Molly Bassermans boarding house and runs her store out of Lady "Mac" MacBeths brothel, called the Red Derrick. She obtains a loan from banker Charlie Madden. She is courted by Casey, who learns that Lucy was jilted at the altar when her fiance found out about her fathers dishonest business practices. Casey insists that she give up her business. They quarrel, and after joining the United States Army during World War II, he becomes engaged to a fashion model in Paris. But Casey soon returns to Texas to save Lucy from banker Maddens underhanded business dealings. He also salvages their romance.
