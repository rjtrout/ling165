Preparing for her coronation, Princess Ann flies to New York City along with her Aunt Margaret, the countess, to do some shopping. At their hotel, in the room momentarily by herself, Ann hears music and inquires at the front desk about it. She discovers it is emanating from a college fraternity party on the hotels fourth floor. While listening outside, Ann is abruptly pulled into the room by Riff Manton, a college student who is also a singer. They dance together and Ann attempts to lose her inhibitions, but the impropriety of the situation compels her to leave without ever having identified herself. Riffs father, George, is a theatrical producer. Separated from his wife of two decades, Martha, he is dating Leslie Anders, a wealthy socialite. Riff objects to this, although Leslie is offering to finance his fathers next show. Balenko, an aspiring dress designer, shows Riff a newspaper photo of him dancing with royalty and asks for an introduction to the princess. Riff is shocked to discover who she was. He is able to track her down, apologize and ingratiate himself to her. After persuading Ann to accompany him out for the evening, then scheming to ditch her disapproving chaperone Margaret, he takes her to a nightclub. The featured entertainer, George Jessel, invites the princess onto the stage, where they do a duet. Ann is charmed by Balenko and orders 25 dresses from him. Balenko is so happy, he offers to use the money to finance Riffs fathers show. An irritated Leslie ruins the tailors reputation with the countess, who rescinds the order. Riff straightens everything out and his parents reunite. After being saddened by Princess Anns departure, Riff then he is informed by Balenko that they both will be receiving invitations to the coronation.
