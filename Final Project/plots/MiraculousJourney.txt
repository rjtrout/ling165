A group of seven people - an actress, a blind girl, a financier, a gangster, an heiress, a hostess, and a pilot - survive an airplane crash to find themselves deserted in an African jungle. The group come across an old hermit who has been living on the island for a while. The hermit teaches them how to survive in the jungle, though the unrepentant gangster is eaten by a crocodile. Eventually, a member of the group named Larry uses a canoe to get off the island. Larry locates a helicopter and flies back to the island, where he picks up the rest of the group. Although they offer the hermit a ride, he declines the offer, feeling he has become too attached to the jungle.
