Oliver Barrett IV is emotionally devastated by the death of his young wife Jenny, who succumbed to leukemia. As he tries to lose himself in his work as a lawyer, the long hours dont ease his pain, especially when he finds that his leftist views conflict with those of the senior partners at the firm. Olivers inconsolable grief begins to alienate those around him, at least until he finds new love with Marcie Bonwit, the wealthy and beautiful heiress to the Bonwit Teller fortune. Despite his affection for her, Oliver finds it difficult to leave the memory of Jenny behind, which causes many problems in their relationship, even as he concurrently begins a reconciliation with his autocratic father. Though Oliver and Marcie eventually part, Oliver and his father reconcile when both men discover things they never knew about each other.
