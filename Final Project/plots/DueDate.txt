Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.), a successful architect, is due to fly home from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be with his wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), who is about to give birth. On the way to the airport, he has a chance encounter with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), who is going to LA to be an actor and is planning to scatter his recently deceased fathers ashes at the Grand Canyon. When Ethan misuses the words "terrorist" and "bomb" while talking to Peter, they are both escorted off the plane. This is only the first of a series of misadventures caused by the drastically dysfunctional Ethan. Peter, now on the No Fly List and missing his wallet, agrees to drive with Ethan to Los Angeles. Ethan stops to buy marijuana, and Peter discovers that they are nearly out of money. Since Peter has no I.D., he gets his wife to wire the money to Ethan, but discovers Ethan had the money wired to his stage name instead of his legal name. When the Western Union employee (Danny McBride) refuses to accept Ethans "Stage name I.D." it leads to a violent altercation. After a night at a rest stop, Peter decides to drive off and abandon Ethan, but realizes that he still has Ethans fathers ashes, having forgotten to unload them with the rest of Ethans stuff when he left. This causes him to wrestle with his conscience, and he decides to return. Ethan drives so Peter can get some rest, but he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the car. After Peter and Ethan are picked up by Peters friend Darryl (Jamie Foxx), Peter again decides to part company with Ethan. Darryl initially persuades him otherwise, but then throws Ethan out after mistakenly drinking some of Ethans fathers ashes, which were stored in a coffee tin. When Darryl lets them use his Range Rover to make the rest of the trip, Ethan mistakenly drives to the Mexicoâ€“United States border. Despite assuring Peter that hell handle the situation, Ethan flees, and Peter is arrested for possession of marijuana. The Mexican Federal Police lock Peter up, but Ethan steals a truck and breaks him out, causing several car crashes in the process. They stop at the Grand Canyon, and Ethan finally scatters his fathers ashes. Peter then confesses that he tried to leave Ethan at the rest area. Ethan makes a confession of his own: he has had Peters wallet and I.D the entire time. Peter seemingly forgives him but then attacks Ethan in a rage, but is interrupted by a call from Sarah, who has just gone into labor. Peter and Ethan leave for California. Ethan finds a gun in the truck and he accidentally shoots Peter. Arriving at the hospital where Sarah is in labor, Peter passes out from loss of blood. Sarah delivers the baby safely, and Peter expresses his discomfort at his new daughter being named Rosie Highman. Ethan leaves while telling Peter to call him. At the end, Ethan guest stars on an episode of his favorite television program, Two and a Half Men with Peter and Sarah watching it in bed with their daughter.
