Peter "Junior" Potter (Hope) has graduated from Harvard and now heads west to the town of Sawbuck Pass to claim his Daddys fortune. Driving into town in a jalopy and wearing a comical plaid suit, he splashes mud all over a crowd of townspeople. He also discovers to his horror that practically everyone in town claims to be owed a debt, and that his fathers treasure chest is empty. Junior stalls the townfolk for as long as he can, continually making allusions to his wealth. He makes the acquaintance of a singing cowboy named Roy (Rogers) and a sexy saloon performer with the masculine name of Mike (Russell), who has to fend off Juniors persistent advances. A grizzled local character also befriends Junior and continues offering him advice, eventually finding the hiding place of his fathers hidden fortune. Meanwhile, a mysterious masked bandit known only as "The Torch" has been leading midnight raids. What the wise-cracking, clueless Junior doesnt know is that the object of his affections, Mike, is in fact The Torch, and that Roy is a government agent with a Smith & Wesson Model 320 Revolving Rifle hidden in his guitar case, bent on capturing her.
