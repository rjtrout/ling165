Beaver Greenway, a longtime horse owner with a drinking problem, is upset because one of his mares has been lured away by Thunderhead, the wild stallion that previously belonged to Rob and Nell McLaughlin. He goes to Goose Bar Ranch to assist in the hunt for the wild stallion, who is now well known for taking the Albinos place in stealing mares from many different states but the McLaughlins no longer have any control of the horse. Ken McLaughlin returns home to his parents from a horse-buying trip with Crown Jewel, a trotter. Rob is skeptical about the purchase, more so when Crown Jewel develops altitude sickness in the Wyoming hills. Ken goes on a date with Greenways granddaughter Carey. A veterinarian advises Crown Jewel be put down due to its congested lungs, but Beaver Greenway, a former sulky driver, recommends a treatment that works. Thunderhead returns and lifts the mares spirits. Crown Jewel is taken to Ohio to compete in the Governors Cup sweepstakes, where Ken McLaughlin has entered his own horse, Sundance. Ken was going to ride Crown Jewel, but Sundance wins. But all of the McLaughlins are proud of Crown Jewels effort, particularly when they learn she is pregnant.
