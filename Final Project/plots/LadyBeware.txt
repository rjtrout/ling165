Katya Yarno is a window dresser for Hornes department store who specializes in displays with sexy, slightly kinky themes. Surrounded by the equipment of her trade — mannequins and lingerie — Katya lives in a loft apartment in downtown Pittsburgh. She spends her evenings taking her bath by candlelight and thinking up new and more provocative window displays. Katya soon becomes the obsession of Jack Price, a handsome (and married) psychopath. Jack proceeds to stalk Katya and makes her life a living hell. Tired of being harassed, Katya decides to give Jack a taste of his own medicine.
