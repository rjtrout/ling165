In 2008, while rehearsing for a charity event, actor Joaquin Phoenix, with Casey Afflecks camera watching, tells people hes quitting to pursue a career in rap music. Over the next year, we watch the actor write, rehearse, and perform to an audience. He importunes Sean Combs in hopes hell produce the record. We see the actor in his home: he parties, smokes, bawls out his two-man entourage, talks philosophy with Affleck, and comments on celebrity.
