Robert Cole (Albert Brooks) is a Hollywood film editor right in the middle of cutting a new science fiction film featuring George Kennedy. His relationship with very patient bank executive Mary Harvard (Kathryn Harrold) is caught between undying devotion and endless agony. Its all because selfish Robert is a bit of a self-involved neurotic who cant quite decide if their relationship is meant to be, mainly because hes not sure if shes the one or theres someone else. Robert breaks off their relationship only to find that modern romance isnt as easy as it seems, and the people you love might be the ones you constantly hurt the most. He and Mary end up driving to a cabin in Idyllwild, California, where intense jealousy causes Robert to alternately accuse and annoy Mary and propose marriage to her.
