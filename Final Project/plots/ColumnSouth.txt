Immediately prior to the American Civil War, a Union officer (Audie Murphy), tries to prove local Navajo Indians are innocent of killing a prospector. He has to fight the anti-Indian attitudes of his superior officer (Robert Sterling) and North-South tensions within the soldiers. He discovers Confederate sympathizers are planning to cause the Indians to go on the warpath for their own benefit.
