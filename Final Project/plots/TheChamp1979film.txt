Billy Flynn, an ex-boxing champion, is now a horse trainer in Hialeah, Florida. He makes just enough money to raise his little son T.J., of whom Flynn has full custody since his wife, Annie, left him, seven years before the events of the film. T.J. worships "The Champ," who has gambling debts and begins working on a comeback to give his boy a better future. They go on the road, and Billy manages to get some boxing bouts. However, their lives are turned upside down when Annie appears and says she wants to take custody back. Having remarried, she is now quite well off. Billy throws himself into a proper regime of training, to keep T.J. and earn his respect. T.J. spends some time with Annie, and she showers him with expensive gifts that Billy cant compete with, until Billy buys him a pony. Billy is resentful that hed cared for T.J. all these years and she just shows up wanting to be a parent again. The movie ends with Billy as one half of a good boxing billing, but his opponent is formidable. Billy wins in the end and everyone in the dressing room, including T.J., is delighted, but his win comes at a price, and Billy dies.
