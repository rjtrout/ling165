The film stars Cryer as Morgan Stewart, the son of a Republican senator from Virginia who has spent most of his life away at boarding school. An eccentric boy who is a fan of horror films, his personality does not fit in with the carefully calculated conservative image his mother (Redgrave) has designed for their family. He is brought home to help with his fathers campaign for re-election as Senator, and unwittingly discovers that others are setting the family up for the fall. With the help of a zany new girlfriend (Davis) he manages to save the day, and loosen up his family in the process.
