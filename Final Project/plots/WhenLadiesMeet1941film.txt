Mary Howard (Joan Crawford) is a novelist with advanced ideas about love and marriage, and is in love with her publisher, Rogers Woodruff (Herbert Marshall). She decides the only logical thing to do is to lure him away from his wife and marry him. Marys friend, Jimmy (Robert Taylor), however, is convinced hes the right man for her and pursues her. He sees through her rationalizations and wrong-thinking and decides to throw Mary and Woodruffs wife Claire (Greer Garson) together at the house of a friend (Spring Byington). The two women do not know each other, but during their chats Mary appreciates and respects Claires maturity and wisdom. When Mary learns Woodruff is a philandering womanizer of long standing, she realizes she cannot love him and welcomes Jimmys attentions.
