In 1912 Sonora, Mexico, African American Lyedecker travels to a remote village. As temporary policeman from Phoenix, Arizona he chases Yaqui Joe, a half-Yaqui Indian, half-white-american bank robber who has stolen $6,000. When Mexican General Verdugo catches the fugitive, Lyedecker learns that Yaqui Joe spent his loot in buying 100 rifles for his Yaqui people who are being repressed by the government. Lyedecker is not concerned with Joes cause of helping his tribe. All he cares about is getting the robbed money returned to a Phoenix bank within his jurisdiction so he will earn a $200 bounty and permanent employment as regular policeman. The two men escape to the hills where they are joined by Sarita, a beautiful Indian revolutionary. They eventually become allies and fight for the Indians. Taking over the leadership of the Yaquis, Lyedecker ambushes Verdugos train while Sarita distracts the attention of the soldiers on board by taking a public shower. The train is later derailed in a town and the culmination had a fierce gun battle, which Joe and his people finally win.
