Franny Ellis (Anne Hathaway), an anthropology student, returns home from her PhD thesis work in Morocco to see her estranged brother, Henry (Ben Rosenfield), a musician who entered a coma after being hit by a car. To revive Henry and repair their relationship, Franny uses writings from Henrys journal to travel among New York City music clubs, where she takes notes on the phrases and music she observes. She fills Henrys sterile hospital room with familiar sounds and scents. Eventually, Franny meets Henrys favorite musician, James Forester (Johnny Flynn), at his concert, and convinces him to play for Henry. Franny and James explore New York City through Henrys experiences, develop a romantic relationship, and Henry awakens.
