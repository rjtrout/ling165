Charlie goes to the movies and falls in love with a girl on the screen. He goes to Keystone Studios to find her. He disrupts the shooting of a film, and a fire breaks out. Charlie is blamed, gets squirted with a firehose, and is shoved by the female star. The title of the film is a variation on the term "stage door johnnie". It was once commonly used to describe someone who regularly loitered near the actors entrances of theaters hoping to meet the players or perhaps land a job onstage or backstage.
