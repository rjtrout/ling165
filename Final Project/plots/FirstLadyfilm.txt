The granddaughter of a President of the United States, Lucy Chase Wayne (Kay Francis) discreetly campaigns to gain the presidential nomination for her beloved husband, Secretary of State Stephen Wayne (Preston Foster). She tries to gain the support of rising Senator Gordon Keane (Victor Jory), a victory that would be doubly sweet inasmuch as he is the protégé of her despised arch-rival, Irene Hibbard (Verree Teasdale). Lucy becomes concerned when rumors reach her that Irene intends to divorce her boring Supreme Court Justice spouse, Carter (Walter Connolly), marry Keane, and try to get him elected President. She concocts a scheme to deceive Irene into believing that Carter will be her partys candidate in the upcoming election (when she knows that he has no chance whatsoever) and force Irene to abort her own plans. Lucy convinces Lavinia Mae Creevey (Louise Fazenda), the narrow-minded, provincial leader of an organization of five million women, to back Carter. To Lucys horror, newspaper magnate Ellsworth T. Banning (Grant Mitchell) adds his support, and Carter is indeed offered the nomination. Lucy learns that Prince Boris Gregoravitch (Gregory Gaye), Irenes ex-husband, is in Washington for negotiations. Learning something interesting from the prince, she has her husband invite the foreign envoy to the dinner in which Carter is to announce his acceptance of the nomination. Gregoravitch is delighted to see Irene and gives her some "good" news. On behalf of his country, he has reached an agreement with the United States in which both sides will recognize each others laws. Once the treaty is signed, he and Irene will be considered divorced by the American legal system. Until then however, Irene is technically a bigamist. Lucy blackmails Irene into getting Carter to decline the nomination, leaving the way free for her husband.
