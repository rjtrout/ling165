With five rival oil companies vying for offshore rights, their chief geologists begin dying under suspicious circumstances. A troubleshooter, Blake Heller, is brought in by one firm to investigate, resulting in almost immediate attempts on his life as well. Heller takes a particular interest in two women, one a neighbor, Treva Saint, who has stock holdings in his oil company, and Peggy Lido, a nightclub singer. He eventually realizes that it is Peggy and her boyfriend, Paul Kimmel, who are behind the killings, Peggy gaining revenge for her former husbands business schemes.
