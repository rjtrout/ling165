Kay Colby (Carole Lombard) is a Park Avenue beauty with two suitors: fianc√© Bill Wadsworth (Cesar Romero) and Scott Miller (Preston Foster). To clear his way, Scott buys the oil company Bill works for and sends him to Japan. Then he sends his own girl friend, Countess Campanella (Betty Lawford), to Honolulu to get her out of the way as well. Kay is upset by Bills leaving, and annoyed by Scott pressing his suit, but Scott has the assistance and approval of Kays mother (Janet Beecher) in his efforts, and the advice of his friend and business partner, Brinkerhoff (Richard Carle).
