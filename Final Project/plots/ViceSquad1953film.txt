A married undertaker having an affair, Jack Hartrampf, is a reluctant eyewitness to the shooting of a Los Angeles cop. He does not wish to testify, but captain of detectives "Barney" Barnaby is just as determined. After a bank robbery pulled by Alan Barkis and his gang, another policeman is gunned down and a bank teller is taken hostage. Escort agency madam Mona Ross is willing to help Barnaby with the case for a fee. Barnaby places one of Barkis partners, Marty Kusalich, under arrest until Marty implicates the real killer. Pete Monte steals a boat in an attempt to get Barkis to freedom, but Barnaby and his lieutenant, Lacey, arrive in the nick of time.
