The film centers around a small-town girl (Michalka) living in a Texas community built on an abandoned drive-in movie lot, who turns to an imaginary friend, The Cowboy (Burke), for solace from her self-absorbed mother (Silverstone) and the dangerous world around her. She and her little brother strike up a friendship with local Native American bachelor Tenkill (Spears), who shares stories with them that shed new light on both their past and their present.
