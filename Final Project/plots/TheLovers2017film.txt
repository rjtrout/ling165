Mary (Debra Winger) and Michael (Tracy Letts) are a married couple. They live together, but are estranged from one another. They are both having long-standing extramarital affairsâ€”she with Robert (Aidan Gillen) and he with Lucy (Melora Walters). Their lovers have both emphatically demanded they break up the marriage and Mary and Michael have vowed that they will do so after a visit from their son, Joel (Tyler Ross), and his new girlfriend, Erin (Jessica Sula). This plan goes awry, however, when an early-morning kiss between Mary and Michael leads to sex. They find themselves falling in love again and having passionate sexual encounters. Simultaneously, their respective lovers become more and more needy and demanding, which makes them less appealing to Mary and Michael. On the train to see his parents, Joel warns Erin that their marriage is a failed one and that his parents are horrible people. He is immediately tense and wary when he enters their house, but is surprised to find his parents acting lovingly toward one another. He begins to think they may have changed. Marys and Michaels lovers become increasingly agitated. Robert is the first to confront his rival, telling Michael in a grocery store that Mary is going to leave him. Then, Lucy approaches Mary in her car and hisses at her. These confrontations cause the renewed rapport between Mary and Michael and their son to fall apart. Mary leaves the house for several hours and cries in her car. Joels anger boils over and he punches a hole in a wall. When Mary returns to the house, Joel storms out, after crying in Erins arms. Mary and Michael do not appear to be upset with each other, but the next scene shows them packing their belongings to depart the house. Following scenes show Mary at Roberts house and Michael at Lucys. However, the film ends with Michael phoning Mary and telling her, "I cant stop thinking about you."
