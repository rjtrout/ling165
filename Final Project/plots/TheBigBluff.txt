The suave Don Juan Ricardo "Rick" De Villa (John Bromfield) and his married lover Fritzi Darvel would like to take off together, but his lack of money prevents them from doing so. A chance encounter introduces Rick to the young, but terminally ill socialite Valerie Bancroft (Martha Vickers), in whom Rick sees the solution to his predicament. Rick sweeps her off her feet and they soon marry, although Valeries entourage are suspicious of him. Rick then proceeds to try and bring about Valeries demise so he can inherit her wealth and live the good life with Fritzi.
