Sgt. Ryker (Lee Marvin) is an American soldier charged with treason during the Korean War, he is court-martialled and prosecuted by Capt. David Young (Bradford Dillman), and convicted and sentenced to death. His wife, Ann (Vera Miles), insists that Ryker received an inadequate defense. She believes her husbands story that he had been on a secret mission, assigned to it by a superior officer who has since died and can no longer vouch for him. Capt. Young is not only persuaded to get General Baileys approval for a new trial, he volunteers to defend Ryker this time. A grateful Ryker ends up furious when he discovers a romantic attachment is developing between his wife and the captain. The new prosecutor, Maj. Whitaker, unearths new evidence damning to the defendants case. At the last minute, though, Young produces a sergeant named Winkler who verifies aspects of Rykers story, which, when followed up on by Young, is enough to set Ryker free.
