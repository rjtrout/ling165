Sam (Mark Duplass) is a washed-up rocker in his mid-30s. Jobless and apartment-less, he crashes with his aunt (Melissa Leo) as a last resort and becomes reluctant camping-trip chaperone to her teenage son and a friend. On the trip, the three males turn out to be on par, maturity-wise. But in the Pacific Northwest wilderness a surprising discovery turns dire -- and the distance from boy to man must be covered overnight.
