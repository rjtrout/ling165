Private detective T.N. Thompson, nicknamed "Dynamite" due to his initials, takes an interest when a man is murdered in San Francisco leaving a casino. The dead man, D.H. Matthews, had an argument outside the casino with Jarl Dvorjak, a celebrated pianist who was gambling while his aloof and money-mad wife Charmian was away. Dvorjaks acquaintance with Mona Lewis led him to the casino, which is owned by her father Clark Lewis and closed by the police after the killing. Mona becomes a suspect, particularly after Dvorjaks business manager Carey Williams is killed as well. When the pianist himself is shot while playing an organ, Thompson puts everything together and reveals to all that Matthews had actually been a son of Dvorjaks from a previous marriage who was conspiring with Charmian to gain his fortune.
