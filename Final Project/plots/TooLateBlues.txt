"Ghost" Wakefield is the leader of a struggling jazz band. At a party he meets the attractive singer Jess, who is in a relationship with the Ghosts agent, Benny. At Ghosts insistence she becomes a member of the band, and he begins a relationship with her, antagonizing Benny. Benny arranges for the band to cut a record. In a party at a bar celebrating the recording session, Benny encourages a tough guy, Tommy, to pick a fight with the band. Ghost avoids fighting, causing a rift with Jess. She leaves the band, and the band breaks up. Ghost becomes the protege of a rich patron, playing the piano at night clubs under her sponsorship, his career in decline, while the rest of the band plays inferior music to make a living. Ghost locates Jess, who has become a prostitute, and goes with her to the other band members, who reject him but begin playing their old music with Jess singing.
