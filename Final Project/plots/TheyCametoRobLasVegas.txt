Steve Skorsky has built himself a reputation in security transport for financial institutions. His security trucks are considered impregnable with armed guards and computer controlled routing. No one has ever successfully raided one until, .......... they came to rob Las Vegas. Gino Vincenzo escapes from prison and plans to rob a Skorsky truck with his brother Tony in an armed assault, but Tony turns down the idea saying it needs more modern planning. Gino goes ahead anyway and he and his gang are killed in the attempt. Tony plans a new robbery, but Inspector Douglas of the Treasury is also after Skorsky as he uses his trucks to move gold for the Mafia. Tony takes a job as a dealer in a Las Vegas casino in order to seduce Ann Bennett who is Skorsky’s secretary and also his mistress. She is a compulsive gambler and Tony helps her to win in return for a share of the profits. She falls in love with him and he persuades her to provide the information he needs to ambush a Skorsky truck in the Nevada desert. He and his gang hide the truck in an underground bunker where they will have time to either persuade the crew to come out, or break into it, but impatience gets the better of the gang members who try to employ their own methods. The plan starts to disintegrate as Inspector Douglas, Steve Skorsky, and the Mafia all try to find the truck which seems to have vanished. Tony eventually succeeds, but Ann urges him to forget about the money and run away with her so that they can be together. It’s then that she realises it was never about the money. It was about ruining Skorsky’s reputation in revenge for the death of Tony’s brother.
