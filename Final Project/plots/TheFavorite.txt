A young French woman named Aimee is kidnapped and forced into a sultans harem in Turkey. Fiercely independent, she resists, but must make choices in order to survive. She begins to influence the sultan toward more fair manners of solving his conflicts, but finds herself at odds with another of his wives, who wants her son Mustafa to become the new sultan. As the years pass, she must deal with the new sultans advances while protecting her adopted son Mahmud, and helping the Ottoman Empire against the Russians who have better weapons than they do. The source for the story is a novel by Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark titled Sultana - La Nuit du Serail.
