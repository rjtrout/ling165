Sandra Marshall (Barbara Stanwyck), the widow of the owner of a remote mansion, arrives to take charge and claim the inheritance of her late husband. She receives a cold reception, especially from research scientist Mark Caldwell (Errol Flynn), who seems to be keeping her sister-in-law Julie (Geraldine Brooks) a virtual prisoner in the house.
