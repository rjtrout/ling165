To finance a new play, Michael McCreigh needs $15,000. He proposes an outrageous wager with his rich Uncle Carlton, that without clothes or money, Michael can make it from New York City to Los Angeles in 10 days, and arrive there in a new suit with $100. If not, he will quit the theater and go into his uncles meatpacking business. Dropped off from a limousine in only his undergarments, Michael dashes into a diner. There he encounters Paula Gilbert and her beau Jackson Wallace, promptly stealing her coat and his tux. While hitchhiking, by coincidence, Paula and her Aunt Charlotte come along. To the consternation of her aunt, who prefers Jacksons prospects, Paula begins to fall for Michael. His various schemes earn him money on the way west, but after two escaped convicts rob them, Paula becomes aware of Michaels bet and is disappointed in him. He manages to get to L.A. just in time, with reward money for capturing the fugitives, and Paula forgives him. Then she demands that he go into his uncles meatpacking trade after all.
