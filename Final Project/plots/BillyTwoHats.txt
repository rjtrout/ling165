Following a bank robbery in the American west, the partner of Scottish outlaw Arch Deans is killed and his young Indian half breed friend Billy Two Hats is captured. While Billy is being transported, Deans gets the drop on Sheriff Henry Gifford at a remote trading post, enabling Billy to escape. As they flee, the sheriffs friend, the trading post owner, named Copeland, takes down his old long-range buffalo rifle and fires a shot that kills Deans horse, breaking his leg. Billy builds a travois on which Deans can ride, dragged behind Billys horse. Billy and Deans encounter Spencer and his wife, Esther, at their remote homestead. Deans persuades Spencer to take him in his wagon to get horses on the condition that Billy stay with Esther to protect her and the homestead from marauding Indians. Billy is also to keep a look out for the pursuing Gifford. Billy and Esther spend their time together talking and develop romantic feelings for each other. Esther, a young mail-order bride from the East, is unhappy with her older abusive husband. She falls in love with the young good looking Billy. Gifford finds the two in bed together, assumes Billy raped the woman, becomes enraged, and beats him. Esther attempts to explain but cant because she stutters uncontrollably when distressed.

Gifford, Esther and Billy then set out after Deans. They find Deans near death. With Esthers help Billy kills Gifford. Deans dies of his wounds.
