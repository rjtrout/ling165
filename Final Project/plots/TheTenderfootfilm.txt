Calvin Jones (Joe E. Brown), a naive cowboy from Texas, comes to New York City, determined to take care of his mother by investing his life savings in a Broadway show. He is duped by producers Lehman (Lew Cody) and McLure into buying a 49-percent interest in their new show, a surefire flop. Lehmans beautiful secretary, Ruth Weston (Ginger Rogers), catches the shy cowboys eye. Jones makes up his mind to produce the play by himself after Lehman and McLure close it out of town. When he cant pay for proper costumes, his star actress quits, so Ruth goes on in her place. Although the play is a drama, it is so poorly done that the audience mistakes it for a comedy. The laughter makes it a surprise comedy hit. Jones and Ruth make a big profit, get married and decide to live in Texas.
