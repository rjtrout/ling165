Dr. Patrick Cory and his wife Janice live in a mountain retreat where Cory attempts to keep a monkeys brain alive after having been removed from the monkeys skull. The private plane of businessman Warren Donovan crashes near Corys cabin, and rescuers request Corys help. Donovan is seriously injured and not expected to live, so Cory takes the businessmans brain for experimentation. Cory manages to keep the brain alive in an electrified saline solution. After writing messages in Donovans handwriting while he is sleeping, Cory believes Donovans consciousness still survives and he attempts to communicate with the brain. Gradually, Cory begins to exhibit Donovans personality traits such as smoking cigars, using ruthless personal manipulation, and walking with a limp. Janice and Frank Schratt, Corys friend and assistant, suspect that Donovans consciousness is using telepathic mind control to overpower Corys free will. In the meantime, news photographer Yocum discovers that Cory has illegally stolen Donovans brain and demands money to keep the secret. Donovans brain grows increasingly powerful, using Cory to collect a financial fortune and taking control of Yocums mind and forcing him into a fatal car crash. After realizing that Donovan can control only one person at a time, Janice and Frank plot to destroy the brain. However, Franks plan goes wrong when Donovan forces Frank to shoot himself. Ultimately, lightning strikes the Cory home and a fire breaks out, burning Donovans brain and bringing an end to the horror. Frank survives, and Cory willingly goes to accept the consequences for his actions.
