Con man Michael Rangeloff (Michael OKeefe) is a fugitive from the law and from a womens roller derby team. Stealing a coffin and boarding a train, he masquerades as a soldier bringing home a comrades body, but the casket actually houses $5 million in stolen money that is being sought by several parties. Rangeloff claims that his deceased friend is Lane Biddlecoff (Carrey), but Biddlecoff is a draft-dodger who is still alive.
