Max Hagan, a Texas oil tycoon, is going through a difficult divorce. When his soon-to-be ex-wife throws him out of his house with nothing but the clothes hes wearing (including the titular "white pants"), he becomes entangled in a sex, drugs and rock-n-roll-laden adventure with his daughters punk-rocker boyfriend as he tries to make things right between himself and his dysfunctional family.
