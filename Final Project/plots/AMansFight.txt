As described in a film magazine, wealthy clubman Roger Carr (Farnum) assumes responsibility for a murder for which he believes his sister is guilty. He serves his sentence and returns home only to find that his father will not accept him back as he has besmirched the family name. His sister has entered a convent. He goes west and engages in his profession, mining engineer, soon becoming the leader of the independent miner operators against trust persecution. Here he meets and learns to love a western girl that works as his stenographer. When success is about to crown his efforts, his antagonists discover his prison record and use it against him. Then his sister appears with a signed confession of a butler, formerly in their employ, who told the truth of the murder on his dying bed. This results in a happy ending.
