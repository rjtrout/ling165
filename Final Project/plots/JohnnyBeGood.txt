Johnny Walker is the top high school quarterback prospect who is heavily recruited by many schools. His best friend, Leo Wiggins, thinks he should hold out for the best offer. His girlfriend, Georgia, wants him to go to State with her and get a solid education. The colleges offer him everything he could possibly wantâ€”girls, cars, cash, free room and board, etc. One school even buys Leo a car, while another offers to provide him with male companions if he isnt interested in women. His coach, Wayne Hisler, who he really cant stand, even tries to sell him out by striking a deal with one of the interested colleges to become their next head coach. Although he has all the skills a coach would want in a quarterback, he is unsure where he wants to go and is tempted by the offers because of all of the praise and attention. His recruitment is followed closely by a recruiting investigator who is trying to make sure everything is on the "up and up". Although Johnny lives with his mother, grandfather, younger brother, and sister, he is offered everything and anything by every interested college except for the local state college, which is where he ends up going.
