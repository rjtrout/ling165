Floyd owns a bar called the Blue Water Grill in a town of that name on an island off the gulf coast of Texas. He has lost interest in almost everything in the year since the mysterious disappearance of his wife, neglecting his business and staying home to watch old home movies of their life. Floyds father-in-law, known to all as the General, uses a wheelchair and is trapped in the throes of dementia. An intellectually disabled local man called Jimmy comes by to look after the General at times when Floyd cant be there. Into their lives comes Louise, a school bus driver who is falling for Floyd and trying to get him to come out of his stupor. Land opportunists are trying to seize his property and taxes need to be paid. With the troubles piling up, Floyd is eventually forced to confront his future.
