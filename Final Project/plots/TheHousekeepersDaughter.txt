Hilda is fed up with her life as a gun moll to gangster Floyd and visits her mother, housekeeper for the cultured Randall family. Professor Randall and his wife go on vacation, leaving behind sheltered son Robert to embark upon a career as a reporter at Hildas urging. Soon after, Benny, a feeble-minded flower vendor, follows showgirl Gladys Fontaine when Floyd forces her to join him on his houseboat to take Hildas place. Fearing for Gladys safety, Benny poisons a cup of coffee intended for the gangster, but Gladys drinks it instead. Benny watches in horror as Floyd tosses the dead girls body into the river. The next morning, Robert reads about Gladys death and attaches himself to hard-drinking, womanizing ace crime reporter Deakon Maxwell and his photographer, Ed OMalley. The trio go to police headquarters, where every bum on the waterfront at the time of the murder has been rounded up for questioning. Benny confesses to accidentally killing Gladys but is ridiculed and not believed. Robert takes pity on the little man and befriends him. After a night of drinking with Deakon and Ed at his expense, and learning from Benny that Gladys was thrown from the houseboat, the drunken Robert calls his editor and reports the details. Waking up the next morning with no memory of the evenings events, Robert finds that his story has scooped the other newspapers and that he is being hailed as a true newspaperman. Roberts byline story leads Floyd to believe that the reporter has the goods on him, and he orders him eliminated. Floyds gang converges on the Randall house, where he finds and menaces Hilda. Benny makes more of his fatal coffee to protect her. Deakon and Ed are drunkenly shoot fireworks from the roof and, believing them to be gun shots, the gangsters open fire. As the mobsters begin dropping dead from Bennys poisoned coffee, the police come to the rescue and Robert wins the affections of Hilda.
