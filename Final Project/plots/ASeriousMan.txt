In a prologue, a Jewish man in an unnamed 19th-century Eastern European shtetl tells his wife that he was helped on his way home by Reb Groshkover, whom he has invited in for soup. She says Groshkover is dead and the man he invited must be a dybbuk. Groshkover arrives and laughs off the accusation, but she plunges an ice pick into his chest. Bleeding, he exits their home into the snowy night. In 1967, Larry Gopnik is a professor of physics living in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. His wife, Judith, tells him that she needs a get so she can marry widower Sy Ableman, with whom she has fallen in love. Meanwhile, their son Danny owes twenty dollars for marijuana to an intimidating Hebrew school classmate. He has the money, but it is hidden in a transistor radio that was confiscated by his teacher. Daughter Sarah is always washing her hair and going out. Larrys brother, Arthur, sleeps on the couch and spends his free time filling a notebook with what he calls a "probability map of the universe". Larry faces an impending vote on his application for tenure, and his department head lets slip that anonymous letters have urged the committee to deny him. Clive Park, a South Korean student worried about losing his scholarship, meets with Larry in his office to argue he should not fail the class. After he leaves, Larry finds an envelope stuffed with cash. When Larry attempts to return it, Clives father threatens to sue Larry either for defamation if Larry accuses Clive of bribery, or for keeping the money if he does not give him a passing grade. At the insistence of Judith and Sy, Larry and Arthur move into a nearby motel. Judith empties the couples bank accounts, leaving Larry penniless, so he enlists the services of a divorce attorney. Larry learns Arthur faces charges of solicitation and sodomy. Larry turns to his Jewish faith for consolation. He consults two rabbis but his synagogues senior rabbi, Marshak, is never available. The first, a junior rabbi, advises Larry that he lacks "perspective"; the second rabbi tells Larry a parable about a dentist. Larry and Sy are involved in separate, simultaneous car crashes. Larry is unharmed, but Sy dies. At Judiths insistence, Larry pays for Sys funeral. At the funeral, Sy is eulogized as "a serious man". While her husband is away on business, Larry calls on his neighbor, Vivienne Samsky, whom he has seen sunbathing naked, and she introduces him to marijuana. He later dreams that he is having sex with her, but this turns into another nightmare. Larry is proud and moved by Dannys Bar Mitzvah, unaware that his son is under the influence of marijuana and unable to read the Torah. During the service, Judith apologizes to Larry for all the recent trouble and informs him that Sy liked him so much that he even wrote letters to the tenure committee. Danny meets with Marshak, in a brief encounter in which Marshak only quotes Jefferson Airplanes "Somebody to Love," names the members of the band and returns the radio while counseling Danny to "be a good boy". Larrys department head compliments him on Dannys bar mitzvah and hints that he will receive tenure. The mail brings a $3,000 bill from Arthurs lawyer. Larry decides to amend Clives mark from F to Câˆ’, whereupon Larrys doctor calls, asking to see him immediately about the results of a chest X-ray. At the same moment, Dannys teacher struggles to open the emergency shelter as a massive tornado closes in on the school.
