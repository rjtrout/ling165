In the silent film era, Rainbow Studios executives figure they are losing revenue to a rival studio because they dont have Rudolph Valentino. Led by studio head Adolph Zitz, they decide to hold a contest for the Worlds Greatest Lover in order to find a star to combat Valentinos popularity. Rudy Hickman is a neurotic baker from Milwaukee, but aspires to become a Hollywood star. His entry into the contest tests his marriage, and his neuroses manifest in his screen test, where he nearly kills his fellow actress. Surprisingly, this behavior scores favorably with Zitz and the studio executives reviewing his performance. Now calling himself "Rudy Valentine," he gets a slot in the final phase of the contest, just after finding his wife Annie has left him.
