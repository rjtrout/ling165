Brandon Lang is a former college football star who, after sustaining a career-ending injury, takes a job handicapping football games. His success at choosing winners catches the eye of Walter Abrams, the slick head of one of the biggest sports consulting operations in the United States. Walter takes Brandon under his wing, and soon they are making tremendous amounts of money. Langs in-depth knowledge of the game, leagues, and players brings in big winnings and bigger clients. Abramss cable television show, The Sports Advisors, skyrockets in popularity when he adds Langs slick "John Anthony" persona to the desk, infuriating Jerry Sykes, who up to now has been Walters in-house expert. Langs total image is remade — new car, new wardrobe, and a new look — with the assistance of Walters wife, Toni, a hair stylist. Things suddenly go south, however, when Lang begins playing his hunches instead of doing his homework. He loses his touch and is even physically assaulted by the thugs of a gambler who lost a great deal of money following Langs advice. Abrams and Langs once-solid relationship sours. Langs new high-rolling lifestyle depends entirely on his ability to predict the outcomes of the games. Millions are at stake by the time he places his last bet, and Abrams grows increasingly unstable. (Abrams is a recovering gambling addict and alcoholic, among other things. Toni tells Lang early on that Walters life is "held together by meetings; if theres an anonymous at the end of it, he goes. He has to.") He secretly begins gambling all of his own money on Langs picks and becomes suspicious that Lang is having an affair with his wife. The film concludes with Langs predictions coming true for the last game, both of which he allegedly determines by flipping coins in a bathroom, as he leaves New York and takes a job as coach of a junior league football team.
