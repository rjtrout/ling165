Mary Beresford (Boland) is the wife of unambitious law clerk Al Beresford (Beresford). Thanks to Marys tenacity and carefully calculated social-climbing, Al is promoted to the position of personal secretary of prominent financier Elihu Knowland (Keenan). Unfortunately, success goes to Als head like a narcotic, and soon he has alienated everyone in New York, including Mary, who runs off for parts unknown.
