A young Jewish man works in his fathers jewelry business, but he does not like it at allâ€”he wants to be an entertainer, something he knows that his father would never approve of. He comes up with a scheme to put on his own show in a theater and show his father that he can be a success, but things do not work out quite as well as he planned.
