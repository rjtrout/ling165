After sinking into the depths of drunken despair due to the death of his daughter, a man is warned by his doctor that he is on the brink of terminal mental illness. Struck by a fellow alcoholics suggestion that perhaps he should try faith, he begins saving not only himself but others, eventually creating Alcoholics Anonymous.
