In 1878, Ward Kinsman (Robert Taylor), a prospector and Indian scout, has been persuaded by the US Cavalry to find Mary Carlyle, the daughter of a general, who has been taken by Apaches. Setting out on the trail with a few cavalrymen and Ann Duverall (Arlene Dahl), Mary’s sister, they come across an Apache encampment. Ward learns from an Apache woman that Mary has been taken by an Apache called Diablito. Returning to the cavalry fort with Tana, a captive Apache, preparations are made for a full-scale expedition to find Diablito. Captain Lorrison (John Hodiak) proposes to Ann. Ann tells Ward that she has accepted his marriage proposal, but Ward persuades her that she is in love with him. The expedition sets off. Tana tries a double-cross and Ward kills him in self-defence. Eventually the trackers come across Diablito’s camp and stampede the horses. A gun battle ensues. A cavalry re-enforcement column arrives and routs the band of Indians. Ward rescues Mary. Lorrison sets off in pursuit of the escaping Apache, but he is ambushed and killed. Mary and Ann are re-united back at the fort.
