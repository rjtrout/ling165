Set in 1775, during the American War of Independence, the settlement of Boonesborough, Kentucky, is besieged by both hostile Shawnee Indian tribes and the British. Frontiersman Daniel Boone and his family must fight for survival when overtures of peace fail and culminate in a frontal assault on the fort.
