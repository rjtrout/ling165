Swifty Taylor, a journalist with the Globe Times, hunts for the underworld figure responsible for the killing of a crusading district attorney, murdered by curare-laced dart while attending a prizefight, and of a reporter who had got too close to the truth. Meanwhile, Taylors secretary, Julie, hopes to persuade him to settle down and marry her.
