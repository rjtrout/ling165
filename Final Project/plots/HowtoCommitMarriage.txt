Nancy, the 19-year-old daughter of Frank and Elaine Benson (Bob Hope and Jane Wyman), wants to marry David (Tim Matheson), the 20-year-old son of Oliver Poe (Jackie Gleason). What the bride doesnt know is that her parents are about to get a divorce. Poe, a music promoter, has a hunch something is amiss. He doesnt want the kids to get married, so before the wedding he exposes the Bensons secret. Nancy and David decide marriage isnt necessary. They will live together instead, travel around the country with a rock band and heed the advice and wisdom of a Hindu mystic called the Baba Zeba (Professor Irwin Corey). Frank and Elaine are seeing other people. He is involved with a divorcee, Lois Grey (Maureen Arthur), while she is developing an interest in Phil Fletcher (Leslie Nielsen), who also is recently divorced. Poe, meanwhile, continues to see his mistress, LaVerne Baker (Tina Louise). Then one day, Nancy finds out she is pregnant. The Baba Zeba persuades her to put up the baby for adoption. Frank and Elaine conspire behind their daughters back to adopt their own grandchild. Complications arise, resulting in Frank trying to bribe the guru and even disguising himself as one of the Baba Zebas robed followers. By the end, all ends well for everybody; the Bensons get back together and Poe proposes to LaVerne.
