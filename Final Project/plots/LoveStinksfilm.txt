Seth (Stewart), a sitcom writer-producer, meets Chelsea (Wilson), an interior decorator, at his best friends (Bellamy) wedding. Hes immediately sexually attracted to her while shes instantly attracted to his single-ness. They both ditch their wedding dates and start their own date that same night. Chelsea changes from her bridesmaid dress into a sexy outfit and tells him that she has only one rule: she wont have sex with a guy until they have had at least three meals together. Seth proceeds to speed date through the evening ensuring that they actually eat three meals. They end up in the showroom of Chelseaâ€™s job having sex in a four poster bed until Chelseas boss interrupts them and presumably fires Chelsea. The two become a couple, appearing very happy until after a couple of years of postponing a marriage proposal. When Chelsea realizes that Seth wants to remain single and together, she becomes quite bitter. In the next hour of the movie, the two engage in behavior that makes The War of the Roses look like childs play.
