Vicki Wilomirska, an impoverished Polish princess, falls madly in love while dancing with the charming but penniless Austrian baron Nicki Prax. She ends her engagement to wealthy lawyer Hubert Tyler. They marry secretly, but are exposed by one of Nickis ex-girlfriends, decorator Linda Wayne. The two support themselves by being professional house guests in the homes of American nouveau riche, who are impressed by Old World aristocracy. Eventually Nicki decides to do the unthinkable and get a job. Linda pursues Nicki, and Vicki, brokenhearted, sues for divorce. Hubert represents Vicki in the case, and despite Nickis tender declaration of his love, the teary judge grants the divorce. When Nicki returns from South America, Linda asks him to see her. At her office, he learns that Vicki and Hubert are engaged. He persuades Linda to help him get a job with her competitor, who is decorating the new house that Hubert is building for his fiancee. He begins by behaving professionally, but eventually confesses that he loves only Vicki. She tells him that he is too late. At the fancy betrothal party for Hubert and Vicki, Nicki comes to say goodbye. They dance to the same waltz that had ignited their passion when they first met, and the magic returns. They elope once more.
