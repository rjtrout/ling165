U.S. Army private Jerry Walker is in hot water with his sweetheart, Winnie Porter, for putting off their wedding, and with his superiors on the base after crashing a Jeep. To raise money to pay for the damages and avoid six months of guard duty, Jerry accepts a $300 proposal from three matronly women, Cornelia, Nancy and Maggie, to arrange dates for them with young soldiers. Jerry ropes his pals Barney and Frankie into it, then scrambles when they try to squirm out of it. Winnie, meantime, figures out Jerry is up to something. She shows up with the girlfriends of Barney and Frankie, after which everybody takes turns trying to make the others jealous. Jerry finally flees, only to end up hooked by a German submarine. He ends up in the brig, but its a year later and Winnie, now his wife, comes to visit along with their baby.
