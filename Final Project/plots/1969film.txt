The boys, Ralph and Scott, hitchhike home from college, arriving on Easter morning and shout their greetings across the glen to their family during a lakeside Easter Sunrise service, much to the amusement of Ralphs younger sister, Beth, and mother, Ev, and embarrassment of Scotts mother, Jessie, and father, Cliff. Later that day, they drive Scotts older brother, Alden, whos shipping off to Vietnam, to the bus depot; Alden pushes Scott when Scott says that his Marine brother is afraid to go to Vietnam. They begin fighting until their father arrives wondering what is going on. A few weeks later, Scott and Ralph again return home from college to attend Beths high school graduation, where they learn that Alden has disappeared and is considered Missing in Action. Scott learns that Ralph has flunked out of college (thus making him eligible to be drafted). Ralph and Scott hatch a plan to steal their files from the local draft board office, but they are caught, and Ralph is arrested. Scott is now determined to avoid Ralphs fate and plans to leave town and head to Canada to avoid the draft. Scott invites Beth to travel in his van on his trip out of town and to stay away until the end of the war. They admit their attraction to each other. Later, the two decide to visit Ralph in jail to tell him that they are leaving. Scott and Beth get to the Canadaâ€“US border and are about to cross but have a change of heart and head back to Maryland. When they get home, they learn of Aldens death. Scott leads a huge march downtown in the midst of Aldens funeral, where Ralph is released from jail and the two friends are reunited.
