Tom takes a chicken leg from the kitchen, but knocks over crockery. Just in time, Tom passes the leg onto Jerry, framing him as Mammy Two Shoes arrives. Tom then chases Jerry outside and steals the chicken back to eat it. Jerry then sees Spike cuddling with his bone and exacts revenge by quietly stealing it from him and placing it on Toms chest. "Hey, you! Whatcha doin with my bone?" Tom (gesturing) "Who, me?" Spike: Yeah, you!; Listen, pussy cat! If I catch you takin my bone again, theres gonna be trouble! Understand!?" The dog angrily warns the cat to stay away from his bone. He sticks out his tongue but Spike gets infuriated again and whacks him once more, and he bites it. Tom then spots Jerry laughing and chases the mouse again, but Jerry spins Spikes bone into the air and into Toms hands. Tom tricks Spike into sitting up and puts the bone on top of his nose to escape. Spike digs a hole to hide the bone in, though Jerry steals it while he is not looking, before going back to sleep. Jerry then sneaks up behind Tom, who is keeping watch behind an automated trash can, ties the bone to the cats tail and slams the lid into his face. As Tom chases Jerry, Jerry goes around Spike to ensure he sees the bone. Spike bites on the bone, but Tom and Spike get tangled up in a tree. Tom puts the bone in Spikes mouth and winds it up to send Spike flying into his doghouse. Spike places the bone in his house, but Jerry screws a magnetic iron into the bone and places a magnet into a sleeping Toms mouth, causing the bone to stay stuck to the cat. Tom throws the bone out into the street, but Spike misses it in midair and then off the fence. He finally bites it, but runs into a tree, managing to grab it once more with his tongue before losing it. Tom retreats down the street, with the bone following him on its own accord and Spike following. Jerry, hiding in a tin can, smiles, but is then dragged along in the pursuit in the can by the magnet.
