The storyline is told through a series of flashbacks. The movie opens with Winston regaining consciousness in an alley in the middle of the night with no idea of how he got there. Through a series of flashbacks, he remembers that he was waylaid on his way to the prom the night before. In the meantime, he has to figure out what happened to his wallet, his car keys, his prom date, and why a pimp named "Tito" wants him dead. After losing a bet on a football game, Tara has to go to prom with the flattered but clueless nerd Winston. In the hijinks that follow, Winston manages to get them lost in the ghetto, befriend a hooker named Rhonda (Theresa Saldana), and accidentally sell Tara to a diminutive pimp named Tito (Trinidad Silva). Winston spends the remainder of the evening searching for Tara in the seedy underworld of Los Angeles whilst seeking to avoid Titos wrath after Tito discovers the identity of Taras father. In the end, Winston gets the girl, escapes from the pimp and even recovers his dads car from a car thief named "Danny Boy". An abbreviated version of the Funk-Rock collective, Parliament-Funkadelic appears in the movie under the name the Rats Nest Band.
