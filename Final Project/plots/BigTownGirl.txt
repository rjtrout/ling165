About to serve a 20-year prison sentence for a bank robbery, Jim Mead escapes. He tracks down estranged wife Peggy Melville, a singer, but she flees, moves to a new town and changes her name to Fay Loring, taking a job at a department store. A publicist, Larry Edwards, overhears her singing in the store one day and thinks he can make her a star. He accidentally gets Fay fired, so she takes him up on his offer. Unwilling to show her face in public, for fear Mead will find her, Fay performs as the "Masked Countess," using a fake French accent. Mark Tracey, a reporter, becomes determined to find out the masked womans true identity. A stormy relationship develops between them. Mark prints a story with a photograph, and Mead recognizes a ring on the singers finger. When the reporter brings along an immigration official demanding to see the French countesss papers, Fay runs away. In a rural area she crashes her car. Mark, in pursuit, is asked at a gas station if he can give a ride to a "big town girl" who crashed her car. Without her mask, Fay is unrecognized by Mark. As romantic sparks develop between them, Mead turns up and the two men fight. The cops apprehend Mead just in time. Back at the nightclub, the Masked Countess tries to kiss Mark, but he refuses. Fay, delighted by his loyalty, reveals herself to him at last.
