Pippo, a tailor, impersonates Casanova to woo the girls, particularly the widow Bruni. Casanova has left town, pursued by creditors who persuade Pippo to impersonate Casanova at the behest of a Genoan family that will pay "Casanova" to test the fidelity of the sons betrothed. Pippo, the widow Bruni and Casanovas valet Lucio travel to Venice. The Doge of Venice, "a snake with whiskers," to use Pippos description, intends to use the intended seduction as an excuse to wage war against Genoa. After many humorous adventures, exploiting Pippos traits of vanity, arrogance and cowardice, the heroine so impresses Pippo with her dignity that he refuses to cooperate in the plot to ruin her character. He is arrested by the Doge and sentenced to death on the guillotine. A desperate Pippo turns to strangers for help, but is shocked when they prefer that he lose his head.
