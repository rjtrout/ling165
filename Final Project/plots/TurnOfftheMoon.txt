Star-gazing department store owner J. Elliott Dinwiddy believes everything an astrologist, Dr. Wakefield, tells him. So when he supposedly can win the heart of secretary Myrtle Tweep just by arranging a love match between a boy and girl by a certain hour that night, while the stars are in alignment, Dinwiddy is determined to do just that. He singles out Caroline Wilson, a dancer who happened to be in the store. Dinwiddy plays cupid to pair her with Terry Keith, a popular songwriter who has been giving musical help to Dinwiddys no-talent son. A few mixups later, Caroline gets arrested, Dinwiddy does, too, and when Myrtle gets a call, shes no help at all. Wakefield extends the deadline, giving time for Dinwiddy to get the couples in question back together.
