In 1940, while on a cruise, stodgy, overly frugal businessman Larry Wilson (William Powell) gets hit on the head with an oar while rescuing a drunk Doc Ryan (Frank McHugh) from the water. He wakes up and remembers that he is actually a suave conman named George Carey. Georges last memory is of going to place a large bet in 1931. When the ship docks at New York, he is met by Kay (Myrna Loy), whom he discovers is his wife. She is in the process of divorcing him to marry Herbert (Donald Douglas). They go home to the small town of Habersville, Pennsylvania. George talks Doc (who is also a con artist) into masquerading as a physician treating him, partly out of curiosity, but mostly because of greed, after seeing the enormous balance in his checking account. That turns out to be a dead end (the money is only held in trust for the Community Chest), so he decides to swindle people using his alter egos sterling reputation. He sends for Duke Sheldon (Edmund Lowe), who plants oil on a lot George owns. A complication arises when he falls in love with Kay a second time. She however wants nothing further to do with her boring cheapskate of a husband. George attempts to win back Kays affections while simultaneously trying to sell the worthless land to several greedy leading citizens of the town. In the end, he decides to abort the swindle, but Duke will not let him. They fight, and George is knocked out by a punch. When he comes to, he is Larry once more. Duke leaves in disgust. When Doc notes that one knock on the head reversed the effect of another, Kay picks up a vase, but before she can use it, "Larry" proves that he was only faking to get rid of Duke.
