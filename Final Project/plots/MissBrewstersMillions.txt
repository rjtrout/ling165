Polly Brewster (Daniels), a penniless Hollywood extra, inherits one million dollars from her recently deceased father. However, young lawyer Tom Hancock (Baxter) informs her that she cannot spend the money but must invest it. Her Uncle Ned Brewster (Sterling) arrives and in revenge for indignities his brother made him suffer, he offers Polly his entire fortune of $5 million on the condition that she spend the inherited million within 30 days or less. Polly gleefully sets about investing, gives a great ball and fashion show, and runs down a man with her car and has him sue for a large sum. However, when the deadline arrive, Uncle Ned proves to be penniless; there is no $5 million to be inherited. However, Polly finds that her investment in a motion picture company has yielded a handsome return, and she finds happiness with Tom.
