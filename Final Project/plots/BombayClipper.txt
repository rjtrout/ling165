Foreign correspondent Jim Montgomery agrees to quit his job when his fianc√©e Frankie threatens to return home to San Francisco without him, tired of his profession always coming first. He remains in Bombay, India for one more assignment, investigating a report of missing jewels. A mysterious man called Chundra continues to observe him. With the case still unsolved, Jim and Frankie board a plane to Manila, unaware that the gems are aboard. A passenger is mysteriously killed, but not before the jewels are hidden in Frankies case. George Lewis, another passenger, admits to being a courier for the diamonds, saying they are meant to be a gift to a foreign dignitary. Lewis, too, is then killed. Montgomery encounters the culprit and is in danger of being thrown from the plane, but he is rescued by Chundra, who is actually a government agent. Frankie cant blame Jim this time for being in a hurry to get back to work and report the story.
