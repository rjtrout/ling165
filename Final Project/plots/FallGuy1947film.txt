With no memory of the night in question and a few clues, a man tries to prove he did not murder an attractive woman. Tom Cochrane, high on cocaine and covered with blood, is picked up by the police and then questioned by detectives Shannon (Douglas Fowley) and Taylor (Harry Strang), but manages to escape. His girlfriend Lois Walter (Teala Loring), against the wishes of her guardian, Jim Grosset (Charles Arnt), assists Tom and his police-officer brother-in-law Mac (Robert Armstrong) in trying to clear Tom of a possible murder charge. Tom only recalls meeting a man in a bar and going to a party. Tom and Mac find the man, Joe (Elisha Cook Jr.), who takes them to the party scene, the apartment of the Shindells (John Harmon and Iris Adrian), where they find the body of a murdered girl in the apartment above. The police pick up Mac, while Tom trails Marie (Virginia Dale) and Mike (Jack Overman). Joe is murdered for leading Tom to the scene of the crime, and Marie, who had been hired by the killer to get Tom at the apartment when the crime was committed, is choked to death. Tom, following the killer of Marie, is almost trapped and killed himself, but is saved by Mike.
