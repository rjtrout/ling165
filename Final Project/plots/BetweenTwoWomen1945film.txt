This episode in the series should have been called Between Three Women, because there are plot strands involving three, not two, women. Dr. Gillespies (Lionel Barrymore) assistant, Dr. Red Adams (Van Johnson), is still fending off the romantic advances of beautiful blond socialite and social worker Ruth Edley (Marilyn Maxwell), who finally succeeds in winning Reds heart. The second woman is a pretty night club singer Edna (Gloria DeHaven), who collapses suddenly one night after a show and cannot understand why she is no longer able to eat. Red finds out that a complicated subconscious obsession is the cause. The third woman is Sally (Marie Blake), the reliable and wise-cracking switchboard operator in all of the episodes. Sally is stricken with Brights Disease and refuses to let anyone besides Red operate on her ailing kidney. Things turn out well for Red and all three women. There are some scenes in the singers night club that draw inspiration from the countrys immersion in the Second World War. As part of a "home front" money raising contest to help the war effort, Ruth bids extravagant amounts of money for the chance to kiss Red in public. (Allmovie.coms synopsis of the movie has Red romantically involved with ailing socialite Cynthia Grace (Lucille Bremer), who supposedly suffers from a life-threatening blood clot, but this is the plot for Dark Delusion)
