Steve Nichols is a struggling New York City actor who accepts the job of posing as comic-book hero for a movie hes hired to help promote. After he stops a robbery while wearing the "Captain Avenger" costume, his life becomes unexpectedly complicated. Nichols decides to continue "playing" superhero and discovers that a heros life is more complex than he expected. Nichols is hired by the Mayors staff, who hope Captain Avengers tie-in will win votes for an upcoming election. The plan is ultimately discovered and exposed by the media, leaving Captain Avenger on the outs with the public. Encouraged by his girlfriend "Jolene" (played by Archer) to not rely on the costume and mask to gain adulation, Nichols later becomes a bona fide hero when he rescues a child from a burning apartment building.
