King Kong, after being shot down from the World Trade Center, is kept alive in a coma for about 10 years at the Atlanta Institute, under the care of surgeon, Dr. Amy Franklin (Linda Hamilton). In order to save Kongs life, Dr. Franklin must perform a heart transplant and give Kong a computer-monitored artificial heart. However, he has lost so much blood that a transfusion is badly needed, and to complicate matters, Franklin says there is no species of ape or other animal whose blood type matches Kongs. Enter adventurer, and Franklins eventual love interest, Hank "Mitch" Mitchell (Brian Kerwin), who travels to Borneo (as he theorizes that Borneo and the island from the first film were once part of the same landmass) and captures a giant female gorilla who is dubbed "Lady Kong". Mitchell brings her to the institute to use her blood for King Kongs operation. The transfusion and the heart transplant are a success, but Kong escapes along with Lady Kong. Archie Nevitt (John Ashton), an insane army lieutenant colonel, is called in with his men to hunt down and kill the two apes. Lady Kong is captured alive by Nevitts troops and imprisoned; Kong falls from a cliff and is presumed dead. However, as Franklin and Mitchell soon discover, Kongs artificial heart is beginning to give out, forcing them to attempt a jailbreak. They discover that Lady Kong is pregnant with Kongs offspring. The jailbreak is successful thanks to Kong, who has survived the fall and breaks his mate out. After being followed, attacked, and shot by the military, Kong kills Lt. Col Nevitt and dies slowly near a military base on a farm where Lady Kong gives birth to a healthy baby son. Kong reaches out to touch his son just before dying. Having returned to Borneo, Lady Kong lives peacefully with her son in the jungle.
