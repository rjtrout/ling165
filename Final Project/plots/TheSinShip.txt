Smiley Marsden (Ian Keith) is a bank-robber on the run from the police, with his moll, Frisco Kitty (Mary Astor). Cornered, they arrive at the San Francisco docks, where they convince the captain of a small cargo ship, Sam McVeigh (Louis Wolheim), to take them aboard on his run to Mexico, mostly because he is enchanted with Kitty. Marsden is posing as a minister. As the ship sets sail, every sailor aboard lusts after Kitty, none more so than the captain. One night, when inebriated, he corners Kitty in his cabin and begins to force himself on her. She stops him by basically telling him that he is better than that, which makes him do some deep soul-searching. During the rest of the voyage, Kitty manages to fend off the rest of the crew, with the help of the disarmed captain. By the time they dock in Mexico, McVeigh has fallen in love with Kitty, who he still believes to be the wife of "Minister" Marsden. Aware that the authorities might become suspicious of him if McVeighs ship departs immediately, Marsden delays their departure, first through the use of Kittys flirtation with McVeigh, and later through outright sabotage. After the crew accuses McVeigh of the sabotage, Marsdens true identity is revealed, and he is shot trying to flee from the Mexican police. Kitty understands that McVeigh is truly in love with her, and the two end up together after the police release her.
