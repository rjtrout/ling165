Joseph Goebbels, a down-on-his-luck playwright, boards with Col. Eberhardt Brandt. While there, Goebbels falls in love with Brandts daughter, Maria, an aspiring actress who does not return his affections. When Goebbels tries to force himself on Maria, Col. Brandt kicks him out of the house, and Goebbels joins the Nazis. Later, as propaganda minister, Goebbels manipulates Marias career and attempts to force a relationship with her. Maria again rejects him, and he uses his power to blacklist her.
