Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy (Omar Epps) have wanted to be professional basketball stars since they were kids. Monica wanted to play for the Los Angeles Lakers and wear Magic Johnsons number: 32. Quincy wanted to be like his father and play for the Clippers, wearing number 22. However, Monica has to work hard to establish herself, while Quincy was born with natural star potential. As the two struggle to reach their goals of playing professionally, they must also deal with their emotions for each other. The film spans roughly thirteen years of friendship between childhood sweethearts Monica Wright and Quincy McCall. The first quarter of the story begins in 1981, when Monica (played as a youth by Kyla Pratt) and her family moved to Los Angeles from Atlanta, Georgia, and quickly became acquainted with their new neighbors the McCalls. They are a wealthy family due to the success of Quincys father Zeke, who was the star shooting guard for the Los Angeles Clippers. Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly, sharing a love of the game: basketball. Quincy (played as a youth by Glendon Chattman) is shocked that a girl could ever love basketball as much as he did. He is even more shocked when Monica plays so well. Their first interaction results in Quincy angrily knocking her down during game point and accidentally scarring her face. However, the next day, they share their first kiss on the first day of school and end the "first quarter" of the story fighting in the grass. The second quarter of the story begins in 1988, when both Monica and Quincy are the respective leaders of their high school teams. Scouts have taken clear notice of Quincy, who many see as one of the top prospects in the country. His popularity was not just evident on the court as he is extremely popular with the other students. He could have any girl in school that he wanted, but he is still good friends and neighbors with Monica. Monica, on the other hand, struggles with her various fiery emotions on the court. This often resulted in technical fouls at critical moments of games, getting benched, and eventually pushing away many potential scouting opportunities due to her lack of control. Aside from her emotions on the court, Monica also struggles with the emotions she secretly still harbors for Quincy. Often, she struggles to express them as he is always surrounded by other girls. Monica also has problems with her mother Camille, who is a stay at home wife and mother. Ever since she was a little girl, Monica has been pressured by Camille to give up basketball and "act like a lady." This leads to the point, where Camille would force her to wear dresses and skirts against her will. This has continued into her high school years, with Camille still complaining that Monica is too much of a "tomboy" and needs to learn to be more feminine. This prompts Monica to feel hurt and resentful of her mother for not accepting her for who she is. She even refuses to embrace the domestic "housewife" work that her mother seems to enjoy so much. Through soul searching throughout the season, Monica learns to control her emotions and leads her team to the state championship game. Unfortunately, both she and her team came up short leading them to a victory. This left Monica devastated and in tears. Later on, Monica begins to recover from the championship loss with the help of her older sister, Lena, who gives her a makeover. She even finds Monica a college friend to take her to her spring dance. With nothing more than a new hair style and a dress, Monica shows up to the spring dance looking as beautiful as ever. Despite having a date of his own, Quincy notices her and immediately walks over to her to compliment her new appearance. However, he doesnt hesitate to comment on her date. They both show jealousy towards each others dates and part ways instead. Later that night, they both speak outside her window and reveal to each other how their dates didnt meet their needs. She also lets him know that she has a letter from USC and insists on him to open it. After the letter reveals that she has been accepted, he finally stated that USC was also his choice. As they move in to congratulate each other with a hug, Monica mistakes the gesture as a kiss. This action leads to them finally acting on their feelings for one another by making love to each other. It was Monicas first time. The third quarter of the story follows Quincy and Monica to their freshman year at USC in 1988-89, where they are managing themselves as athletes, students, and a couple. Again, the same problems seem to present themselves, this time on a bigger stage. While Quincy finds instant success on the court, as well as more and more female admirers, Monica struggles for playing time, being the backup to USCs senior guard, Sidra ONeal. To make matters worse, she falls on the bad side of the head coach, Ellie Davis. She reprimands Monica both for showing off and for her lack of defense. Her relationship with Quincy becomes more and more strained. Meanwhile, Quincy struggles to deal with the media attention surrounding his father, who is trying to convince Quincy to finish college first before going pro, and a paternity suit against him from a former lover. Quincy feels betrayed by his father for lying to him. He threatens to leave school for the NBA early, despite his father begging him not to sacrifice his education just to spite him. Zeke mentions that his mom was only nineteen when she was pregnant with Quincy and he wasnt ready for a family, but he stayed anyway. Monica finally earns the starting point guard spot at the end of the season. However, Quincy cant be happy for her, because he blames her for not being there for him when he was having problems with his father. Monica is hurt deeply by Quincy, leading the two of them to go their separate ways. The fourth quarter of the story follows the characters through the early 1990s, a few years before the establishment of the WNBA. In 1993, Monicas prospects for professional basketball lie exclusively in the IWBA, the International Womens Basketball Association, while Quincy steps into the pros at home. Monica settles into her new life in Barcelona, where she struggles to cope with the everyday grind of playing overseas away from family and friends. She misses home, but cant imagine a life that didnt include basketball. It was revealed earlier in college, where Sidra points out that Big Toni, their teammate at USC, quits the previous year and now works at a bookstore. Monica tries to adapt to her surroundings as a local sports celebrity and the focal point of the teams offense. She leads her team to a dominant victory in the championship game at the end of the season. Despite all of her personal success, Monica starts to realize that her love for basketball isnt the same as it was before. Having left USC five years earlier after his freshman season, Quincy is now in his fifth year in the pros. He tries to find a role with his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers. The moment he finally finds some playing time, he injures himself landing awkwardly after a slam-dunk and tearing his ACL. His family rushes to the hospital to be with him, but his now divorced parents still have bad blood when they see each other. After Monica hears about Quincys injury, she flies home to see him. Monica goes to the hospital to visit Quincy, and is stunned to hear of Quincys engagement and to meet his fiancée (Tyra Banks). After her meeting with Quincy, Monica soon realizes that her feelings for him still exist. Monica also clashes with her mother Camille again over old resentments, causing Camille to remark that she had to give up her own dreams after having two daughters. Camille also shows open resentment towards Monica for not appreciating the sacrifices she made for her family. However, Monica counter-argued that Camille never made her feel loved and accepted, because she kept trying to force her to give up her goals for a stereotypical "womans role" in life that she didnt want. Over the next few months, Quincy undergoes rehabilitation, while the day of his wedding draws closer. By this time, Monica has decided to give up basketball and work at a bank with her dad instead. When Quincy asks Monica, she states that it was no longer fun for her. However, Quincy does not understand, stating that he never knew anyone who loved basketball as much as she did. After seeing how truly unhappy her youngest daughter is without either basketball or Quincy (or both) in her life, Camille finally relents and encourages Monica to fight for her dreams and the man she loves. Quincy and Monica meet up, this time as friends, and reminisce over their shared past. At this point, Quincy has recovered from his injury, and Monica finally steps up with an ultimatum. She challenges him to one final game on the court. However, this time, the stakes are higher: if he loses, he calls off the wedding and chooses Monica. If not, he marries his fiancée. Her reasoning is that if he loses, it would be, because he let her win, which would mean that, deep down, he really doesnt want to get married, because he still loves her. Quincy agrees and beats her in the game, but can no longer be apart from Monica and chooses her instead. The phrase "double or nothing" brings a whole new meaning to the game. The film fast-forwards to five years later in 1998. Monica has finally gone pro in the WNBA, which was created two years earlier by the NBA in 1996. The movie ends with Quincy helping their baby daughter cheer on Monica during her game. The back of her jersey is seen with the name "Wright-McCall", showing that Monica and Quincy got married. In the closing post-credit scene, Quincy and Monicas toddler daughter is seen in the backyard, running and putting her basketball into her toy basketball hoop.
