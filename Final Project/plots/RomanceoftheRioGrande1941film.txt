The stagecoach carrying Carlos is attacked and he is shot by Carver, a gunman sent by Ricardo and his scheming sweetheart Rosita. As he lay injured, Carlos is found by the Cisco Kid, a bandit. Struck by their uncanny resemblance, Cisco finds a letter from Don Fernando and decides to impersonate him. Ricardo and Rosita are stunned to see "Carlos" alive, unaware the real one is off recovering from his bullet wound. Cisco makes romantic passes at both Rosita and the lovely Maria Cordova, goddaughter of the Don.
