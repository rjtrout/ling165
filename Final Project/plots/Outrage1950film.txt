Staying late at work one night, Ann notices she is being stalked and tries to run away from the man who is following her. She is unable to hide and is eventually caught and raped by the man who works the concession stand, the only thing able to come through to Ann in her trauma, being the memory of a scar the man has on his neck. Returning home after her rape Anns parents learn of what happened and contact the police. Though the police and her family, friends, and fianc√©, Jim, are supportive, Ann believes that the neighbours are gossiping about her and that Jim can no longer see her as she once was. After being forced to look at a lineup of men with scars, none of whom she can identify as her attacker, Ann runs away, taking the bus to Los Angeles on a whim.

Ann is forced to stand trial, but Ferguson investigates why she would do such a thing and learns of her rape. He is able to persuade the judge to commute her sentence, and instead she goes to therapy for a year. At the end of her time in therapy Ann wants to stay with Ferguson and pursue a relationship with him, but he tells her not to run from lifes challenges and encourages her to return to her old life and to Jim.
