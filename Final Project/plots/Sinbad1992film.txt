The brave sailor Sinbad and his loyal servant Habeeb find themselves aboard the ship of Captain Aziz, a trip for which Sinbad had spent all of his fathers fortune. They crew spot an uncharted island, which Sinbad encourages the Captain to approach, hoping that it holds untold riches. Sinbad, Habeeb and two other sailors take a rowboat to the island, which has a strange appearance: it is flat and bare, with no grass, trees or sand. The island shakes violently, and the two sailors return to Captain Azizs ship, leaving Sinbad and Habeeb behind. The island reveals itself to be the fin of a gigantic sea monster, which swims away. Captain Azizs ship leaves as well, leaving Sinbad and Habeeb stranded in the middle of the ocean. In the morning, Sinbad and his servant find that they have been carried to a strange island. They find water, nourishment and horses, which means that there should be people on the island. Sinbad and Habeeb find two foreign-dressed men, who are the sons of King Jamaal of the island of Salabat. These men welcome Sinbad and Habeeb, and lead them to their fathers palace. King Jamaal welcomes Sinbad and Habeeb to his palace and, enchanted by the tales of Sinbads many adventures, asks Sinbad to marry his daughter Nefia. Sinbad accepts, but unwillingly. That night Sinbad reveals to Habeeb that he doesnt want to marry the Kings daughter, and will leave the island in order to avoid fulfiling his promise. Captain Azizs ship has come to the island, and Sinbad approaches the Captain, who is glad to see him and agrees to help him escape. Habeeb and Sinbad sneak out of the castle by hiding in crates that are to be delivered to Captain Aziz as supposed presents from King Jamal. Their ruse is successful, but after Captain Aziz leaves the island, they are attacked by King Jamals ships. King Jamal captures Sinbad and Habeeb and leaves them on an island as their punishment.
