Evelyn Prentice, neglected wife of attorney John Prentice, begins a flirtation with Lawrence Kennard, a poet, who turns out to be a gigolo. It also comes out that John had a brief fling with a former client. After it appears that Evelyn shot Kennard when he attempted to blackmail her, Judith Wilson, another woman, is charged with the crime. Evelyn, along with their small daughter, convinces her husband to take on Wilsons defense. But, as the case progresses, she becomes more and more worried that Judith will be convicted. She decides she must go to court and confess. Despite her husbands efforts to prevent her, Evelyn blurts out that she apparently shot Kennard when they struggled over the gun. John manages to get Judith to confess to shooting Kennard, and to convince the jury it was self-defense. Once it is all over, John tells Evelyn all is forgiven and forgotten.
