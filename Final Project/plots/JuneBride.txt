Foreign correspondent Carey Jackson (Robert Montgomery) returns to New York City when his newspapers Vienna office is closed and is offered a job on a womens magazine called Home Life. He accepts the position only because it will put him in daily contact with editor Linda Gilman (Bette Davis), whom he once loved. Linda is averse to the idea because of his leaving her three years earlier, but agrees to hire him if he will keep their relationship on a strictly professional level. The two head for the Brinker home in Crestville, Indiana, to prepare a feature story about eldest daughter Jeannes (Barbara Bates) wedding to Bud Mitchell (Raymond Roe) for the June issue. Linda wants Carey to write a simple story about the young couple, but he insists on looking for an angle, which presents itself in the form of Jeannes younger sister Barbara (nicknamed "Boo") (Betty Lynn), who confesses she always has been in love with Bud, the brother of Jeannes former beau Jim (Ray Montgomery), who was dumped by Jeanne when he joined the Army. At first Carey proposes they ask an officer he knows to order Jim home for the wedding, but thinks better of it, knowing he will lose his job if the wedding plans are disrupted. Boo, however, secretly telephones Careys friend and arranges a leave for Jim. Complications ensue when Jim arrives home and Carey tries to get rid of him while Linda, unaware of the reality of the situation, intervenes and makes him stay. Jim and Jeanne elope, Linda fires Carey, Carey feigns interest in Boo to make Bud jealous, and the scheme succeeds, with Bud proposing to Boo. Despite losing his job, Carey writes his story, Linda realizes he always knew the truth about the couples, and the two reconcile.
