Carol (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a young woman recovering from her recent, although not the first, nervous breakdown. She has just inherited Midnight, an abandoned nightclub in a seedy neighbourhood that was previously owned by her recently deceased mysterious uncle Fletcher (Sam Schacht). She moves out of the home of her trashy mother Betty (Brenda Vaccaro) and into the nightclub and starts renovating it in hopes of re-opening it. She discovers a secret section of the club that was used as a brothel catering to clients with sexually perverted tendencies. Carol becomes a victim of rape at the hands of three intruders who are let into the club under mysterious circumstances. Due to her history of psychological problems, the police have difficulty believing that what shes telling them is the truth. She makes a friend in Lieutenant Sharpe (Peter Coyote), a detective who claims to have been sent in to investigate the break-in and who seems to believe her story.
