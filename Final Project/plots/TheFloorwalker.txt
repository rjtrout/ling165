Charlie enters a department store and annoys the staff with his antics. Meanwhile, the stores manager and the floorwalker are conspiring to rob the stores safe. When they finish putting the safes contents into a bag, the floorwalker knocks out the manager and flees with the money. Just as the floorwalker is about to exit, he encounters Charlie who looks very much like him. He persuades Charlie to act as his substitute. Nevertheless, the floorwalker is arrested, but Charlie ends up holding the bag. The manager sees Charlie with the bag and begins to chase him around the store. At one point the two men are running down an upward escalator without getting anywhere. Police become involved in the chase and the manager ends up with his head stuck in an elevatorâ€”while Charlie helps to keep it there.
