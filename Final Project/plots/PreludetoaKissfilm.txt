Despite her pessimistic outlook on life, Rita Boyle (Meg Ryan), a liberal, free-spirited aspiring graphic designer and communist who earns a living as a bartender, falls in love with and marries Peter Hoskins (Alec Baldwin), the conservative employee of a Chicago publishing house. At their wedding, they are approached by Julius (Sydney Walker), a lonely, elderly man who requests permission to kiss Rita. When he does, their spirits switch places, leaving Peter with an aged mans soul inside his newlywed bride. Only when he can see beyond the physical and embrace the beautiful soul he loves, will Julius agree to return to his cancer-riddled body by kissing her again.
