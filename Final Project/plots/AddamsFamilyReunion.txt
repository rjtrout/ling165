Discovering that his grandparents have developed "Waltzheimers disease", a disease that is slowly turning them "normal", Gomez organizes a family reunion, hoping that some branch of his enormous family tree will find a cure. Unfortunately, the company arranging it misspells his surname and reunites him with the Adams family instead, including Dr. Philip Adams, who plans to poison his father and rearrange his will. Gomez hopes that Dr. Adams can cure his grandparents; Morticia spends time with the women; Fester and Thing do their best to capture Butcher, a mutated puppy who feeds on human hair; Wednesday and Pugsley are busy making new friends; and Lurch falls in love. A couple who are headed to the reunion are given the wrong address and end up in the Addams family mansion, where Granny and Cousin Itt are staying.
