The musical chronicles the romance between Jamie Wellerstein (Jordan) and Cathy Hiatt (Kendrick). However, it does not take place in chronological order: all of Cathys songs begin after they have separated and move backwards in time to the beginning of their courtship, while Jamies songs start when they have first met and proceeds through their crumbling marriage. This is an example of a non-linear narrative. The musical, as presented on stage, is a two-person show, with no other actors besides the ones playing Jamie and Cathy. Additionally, it consists almost exclusively of solo numbers; Jamie and Cathy alternate songs, do not share the others time frame, almost never sing together and frequently are not even present while the other character unburdens themselves. This gives each character space to present their side of the story, biases and all. In adapting for film, LaGravanese made the decision to have the other character present for each monologue, but no music was altered. Additionally, a number of other actors appear in other parts, though Jordan and Kendrick still provide the bulk of the dialogue and all singing.
