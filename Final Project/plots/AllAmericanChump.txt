Meek clerk Elmer Lamb has a mind for figures, so much so that circus promoter Bill Hogan hires him as "the human adding machine," featuring Elmers dazzling skill for numbers. Elmer wants to make enough money to open his own dairy farm. When the circus goes broke, owner Jeff Crane and daughter Kitty travel east with Elmer and Bill to get a fresh start. On the train, Elmer ends up playing cards with bridge champion J. Montgomery Brantley and defeats him. Brantley attests to Elmers skill, which leads to a nationally broadcast bridge challenge between the two for a prize of $15,000. A gangster gets involved and offers Elmer money to lose the match. Elmer also gets knocked unconscious on the final day of the match and temporarily loses his mental faculties, but Kitty, who now loves him, restores his powers. She then uses the prize money to buy Elmer a farm.
