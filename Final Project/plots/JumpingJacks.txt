United States Army Corporal Chick Allen (Dean Martin) is a paratrooper preparing a show with other soldiers. The general, however, was unhappy with the quality of past shows and is threatening to eliminate them unless the quality improves, which is why Chick has invited his former partner, Hap Smith (Jerry Lewis), to help out. Hap, who has continued their nightclub act with a new partner, Betsy Carter (Mona Freeman), poses as a soldier so that he can do one performance with the general in the audience. The show impresses the general so much that he arranges for the show (including Hap) to tour other camps. Fearing a court-martial, Chick and the rest of the performers pass Hap off as Private "Dogface" Dolan, while the real "Dogface" (Richard Erdman) goes into hiding. Hap undergoes paratrooper training to keep up the ruse, but he is very accident prone. However, it works to his benefit as everything he does inadvertently is the "correct military conduct". The top sergeant (Robert Strauss) takes notice and praises him. Understandably, Hap wants to return to civilian life and tries to sneak away at any chance he can get, but Chick always manages to stop him. During one of his escape attempts, during some war maneuvers, Hap destroys a key bridge and captures an enemy general. Hap is eventually exposed as a civilian, but is sworn in as a paratrooper and becomes a hero.
