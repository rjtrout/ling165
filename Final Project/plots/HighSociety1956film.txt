The highly successful jazz musician C.K. Dexter Haven (Bing Crosby) was divorced from wealthy Newport, Rhode Island, socialite Tracy Samantha Lord (Grace Kelly), but remains in love with her. She, however, is about to get married to a bland gentleman of good standing, George Kittredge (John Lund). Spy Magazine, a fictional tabloid newspaper in possession of embarrassing information about Tracys father, sends reporter Mike Connor (Frank Sinatra) and photographer Liz Imbrie (Celeste Holm) to cover the nuptials. Tracy begins an elaborate charade as a private means of revenge, introducing her Uncle Willy (Louis Calhern) as her proper father Seth Lord (Sidney Blackmer) and the latter as her "wicked" Uncle Willy. Connor falls in love with Tracy, who must choose among three very different men in a course of self-discovery. After becoming tipsy at a party on the eve of her wedding and going off with Connor for a romantic swim, Tracy decides to go through with it until Kittredge takes umbrage. While in the process of telling her guests that the wedding is off, Tracy is surprised by a proposal from Dexter to take the grooms place. Realizing where her heart truly is, she accepts.
