Ellie DeWitt (Rebecca De Mornay) is a former U.S. Marine who wants to become an FBI Agent. However, where she has the physical skills, she doesnt have as much success in memorizing all the books she needs to learn. Fortunately for her, she is in the same room with Janis Zuckerman (Mary Gross), a woman who is as smart as they come, but physically very weak. Overcoming the male recruits assumptions of them, Ellie and Janis team up to help each other through the basic training so they can both become federal agents. During their training, Ellie and Janis must deal with an instructor who seems determined to fail the pair, a fellow trainee who seems more interested in flirting with Ellie (until Ellie asserts her Marine training and pins him against the wall in one exercise), and befriend a geeky co-trainee who seems unable to complete the smallest task. Joining forces, the three tackle the final practice simulation, (badly) forging the instructors signature (he sneezed) and breaking into the telephone room to discover the location of the "hostage" and use their radio to redirect the other agents to make sure they dont find the hostage first.
