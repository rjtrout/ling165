Based on the novel Heritage of the Desert by Zane Grey, the film is about a rancher whose spread includes the only way out of the valley where an outlaw is hiding a huge herd of stolen cattle. When the outlaw decides to challenge the ranchers claim to the land, the rancher stays one step ahead of him and hires a surveyor to remap and confirm the property lines.
