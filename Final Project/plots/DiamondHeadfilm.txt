Richard "King" Howland is a swaggering bigoted land baron living on the Big Island of Hawaii. He objects when his sister, Sloan Howland, announces she plans to marry Paul Kahana, a native Hawaiian, even though Richard is having a torrid affair with an Asian woman, Mai Chen. During Sloan and Pauls engagement party, Mai Chens brother attacks Richard with a knife. Paul tries to break up the fight and is killed. Bitter at her brother for Pauls death, Sloan runs off to Honolulu where she is taken in by Pauls brother, Dean, and his family. Meanwhile, Mai Chen gives birth to Richards child, but dies during childbirth. Ever the rabid racist, Richard refuses to accept the child and Sloan takes it upon herself to care for the baby. After an angry fight with Sloan and Dean, Richard is confronted with a personal dilemma â€” whether to continue on with his close-minded ways or to welcome his newborn son into his family. Although the story is based on the novel by Peter Gilman, the screenplay by Marguerite Roberts makes several significant changes in Gilmans story. Several characters are eliminated, including Richards father, Richards wife, and his hapa haole (half-Hawaiian/half white) half-brother. Roberts also changed the ending of the story.
