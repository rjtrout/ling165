Just north of Texas and west of the Oklahoma border is "Badmans Territory", a region not yet governed by statehood. This is where Jesse James and brother Frank head after a train robbery, along with their partner, Coyote. Mark Rowley, a lawman, and his deputy brother Johnny are after the James gang. So is a ruthless U.S. marshal named Hampton who shoots anybody who gets in his way. He even wings Johnny Rowley just to take the newly captured Coyote away from him. In the town of Quinto, newspaper editor Henryetta Alcott is a crusader for law and order. Mark takes an immediate liking to her. He also helps Belle Starrs horse win a big race. Johnnys injuries mend, but the Dalton gang persuades Johnny to go bad and join them. Mark tries to dissuade him. He shoots a man named McGee who stole his horse. Hampton puts up wanted posters on both Rowleys. Henryetta spreads the word that Oklahoma has annexed this territory into the union. Mark is appointed a "regulator" and proposes marriage to Henryetta before he rides to Coffeyville, Kansas, where the Daltons are about to pull a job with Johnny as part of the gang. Johnny is shot and killed, and Hampton also kills Coyote. A determined Mark Rowley must deal with Hampton once and for all if Henryetta and he are to have a future together.
