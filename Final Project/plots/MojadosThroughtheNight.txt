Filmed over the course of ten days the film follows four men into the world of illegal immigration. Alongside Bear, Tiger, Handsome, and Old Man, director Davis takes a 120-mile cross-desert journey that has been traveled innumerable times by nameless immigrants like these four migrants from Michoac√°n, Mexico. Davis tells the stories of these migrants as their dehydrated days evading the U.S. Border Patrol turn into sub-zero nights filled with barbed wire, storms and ever-present confrontation with death.
