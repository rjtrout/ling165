The short begins with Tom chasing Jerry in circles until he gets a letter that says his fathers twin brothers son George (Toms identical cousin), who has a fear of mice, is coming to visit. Tom boards up Jerrys hole to prevent him from scaring George. But Jerry escapes and unexpectedly encounters George, who immediately tries to get as far away from him as possible. Jerry, not knowing about Toms cousin, believes that the terrified cat is Tom and tries several attempts to frighten him, including saying boo and pulling scary faces. But he gets confused when the real Tom shakes off Jerrys scaring and whacks him with his fist. Having had enough of Jerry bothering George, the two cats play a trick on him by pretending to be a two-headed, four-armed and four-legged monster cat which terrifies Jerry and makes him flee the house and also overcoming Georges fear of mice. A frightened Jerry runs to a house that has a gate with the words "Home For Mice With Nervous Breakdowns" and enters immediately.
