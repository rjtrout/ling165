Kong is a deaf-mute gunman, an assassin for hire who cannot hear his gunshots. He receives his guidance through Aom, a stripper in Bangkok. Kong lost his hearing when he was a child. Because of his disability, he was taunted by other children and grows up into an angry young man. At a target range, he finds he has a knack for target shooting when he visualizes the faces of the boys that taunted him in the target. His deafness gives him an edge in shooting, as he does not react to the gunshots. He eventually gets a job as a janitor at the range. One day while cleaning up, a customer named Jo is at the shooting range with his girlfriend, Aom. Joe notices Kong watching them and he offers the pistol to Kong, who impresses Jo and Aom with his pinpoint shooting. Jo agrees to be Kongs partner and teaches him how to shoot. When Jo injures his gun hand in a battle, Kong is ready to take on more work. Working for a mob boss, Kong is sent on a job to Hong Kong. He shoots his target while riding on the Hong Kong subway with Aom on his back. When Kong returns to Bangkok, he catches a cold and needs medicine, so he stops at a pharmacy and meets Fon, a pretty pharmacist. Their encounter changes Kongs perspective on life as he realizes that life can be meaningful, even for a deaf-mute assassin like him. Aom has trouble with one of the mob boss henchmen. She spurns him, but he rapes her. Enraged, Jo kills the henchman, which brings the mobs wrath down on Jo, which in turn leads to more revenge killing by Kong, and a final big shoot-out in a water bottling plant.
