On the French Riviera, Cécile (Jean Seberg) is a decadent young girl who lives with her rich playboy father, Raymond (David Niven). Anne (Deborah Kerr), a mature and cultured friend of Raymonds late wife, arrives at Raymonds villa for a visit. Cécile is afraid that Anne will disrupt the undisciplined way of life that she has shared with her father. Despite his promises of fidelity to Anne, Raymond cannot give up his playboy life. Helped by Elsa (Mylène Demongeot), Raymonds young and flighty mistress, Cécile does her best to break up the relationship with Anne. The combination of the daughters disdain and the fathers rakishness drives Anne to a tragic end.
