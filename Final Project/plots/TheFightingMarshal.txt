Tim Benton (Tim McCoy) is falsely accused of killing his own father and escapes from prison along with brutish Red Larkin (Matthew Betz). The fugitives head for the former Benton mine now operated by the villainous John Sebastian (Ethan Laidlaw), where Tim plans to rob the payroll. En route, they are discovered by Bob Dinsmore (Anders Van Haden), the new marshal of Silver City, who is killed by Red.
