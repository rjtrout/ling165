John Finley Horton (James Whitmore) is a white journalist who artificially darkens his skin in order to pass for a black man. He travels for several weeks in the Deep South in order to report from the other side of the color line in the segregated society. He spends time in places from New Orleans to Atlanta, and encounters racism from both white and black people.
