Jim White, a football coach, loses his job and moves with his family to take a new job at McFarland High School in McFarland, California, which is predominantly Latino. Discovering that some of his students are strong runners, he organizes a boys cross country team with seven members who have little hope for their future. They become a close-knit, mutually supportive unit. Under Whites guidance the schools cross country team becomes outstandingly successful, winning nine state titles over the years. With respect to that first team, all its members escaped from the cycle of poverty in their lives, being first in their families to go to college or into military careers. Almost all members continue to attend the practice that Jim White held for successive school cross country teams even after graduation from college.
