The wealthy Lady Elizabeth Ferguson threatens to disinherit nephew John Bedford after accusing him of stealing from her. Bedford goes to a pub, where he becomes inebriated, creates a scene and is taken to jail. The dead body of Lady Elizabeth is discovered by her ward, Priscilla Ames, who phones Scotland Yard. It doesnt take long for Inspector Trent to consider Bedford a suspect, but having been in a cell, Bedfords alibi is iron-clad. A jail guard, Scoggins, was bribed to release Bedford for one hour on the night of the murder. When he demands more money, Bedford kills him, first establishing yet another alibi. A suspicious Trent manages to persuade Priscilla to try an elaborate ruse, hiring actress Vera Cavanaugh to pretend to be Lady Elizabeths ghost. As everyone else in the room pretends to see nothing, a terrified Bedford confesses.
