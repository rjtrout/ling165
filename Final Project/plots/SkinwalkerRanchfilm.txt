Strange occurrences have been happening on the Skinwalker Ranch, which have culminated in the disappearance of the ranch owners son. This prompts the dispatch of an investigative team to document the activity and look into the boys disappearance by way of cameras set up throughout the ranch. The cameras record a series of increasingly eerie events and a warning by a Native American man, who tells the crew that their lives are in danger.
