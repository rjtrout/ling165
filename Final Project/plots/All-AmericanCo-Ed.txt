Quinceton College Zeta fraternity stages a revue with members in drag. The resulting publicity catches the attention of newspaperman Hap Holden (Harry Langdon) and Virginia Collinge (Frances Langford). They convince Virginias aunt Matilda Collinge (Esther Dale), President of failing Mar Brynn (a womans horticultural college), to refute the schools staid image by sponsoring a contest awarding a dozen free scholarships aimed at "unusual girls", winners of pagents for fruits, vegetables and flowers, as women most likely to succeed and to be showcased in a musical presentation during the Fall Festival. To publicize the contest President Collinge pokes fun at Zeta members as being least likely to succeed and bans them from their campus. For revenge the Zeta Chapter President Bob Sheppard (Johnny Downs) is coerced to infiltrate Mar Brynn by entering the contest as "Bobbie DeWolfe", Queen of the flowers. After falling in love with Virginia, Bob comes clean and assists in staging the show but includes in the finale a Busby Berkley style spelling out of "Zeta" as revenge for the ban.
