Joe Riley (Glenn Ford) has worked six long years in New York City to save enough money to buy a piece of land in Arizona. Unable to buy a car (because he spent all his money on the property), he has to travel to his new home by hitchhiking. Riley ends up traveling to Arizona along with a homeless man and a local female immigrant.
