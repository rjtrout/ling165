In the "early summer of 1950", Martin Greer owns a small construction company. An Army combat engineer for four years during World War II, he and wife Nancy have two young children. Employee George Kress asks Martin to write a letter to the Selective Service System stating that his son, George Jr., is "indispensable" for their company and thus exempt from the draft. Martin refuses, and George Jr. joins the Army as the Korean War begins. Martins younger brother Jack is in love with college student Carrie Turner, daughter of a judge who is on the local draft board. Despite a trick knee he is drafted; Jack suspects that her father, who opposes their relationship, is the reason. Jack and Martins mother, who lost a son during the last war, asks Martin to write an "indispensable" letter for his brother; he seriously considers it but does not do so, and Nancy criticizes Jack for his reluctance to serve. Jack joins the Army, where he briefly sees George Jr. before the latter goes to Korea. The Army reports that George Jr. is missing in action, and his father drunkenly blames Martin. Martins former superior, who has rejoined the military, asks Martin to join him; although eligible for exemptions, he agrees. Jack and Carrie marry during a furlough before he also goes overseas.
