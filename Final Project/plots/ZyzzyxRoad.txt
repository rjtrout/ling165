Grant is a philandering accountant who goes to Las Vegas on a business trip and encounters a seductress named Marissa and her jealous ex-boyfriend, Joey. Grant and Marissa kill and bury Joey along the eponymous "Zzyzx Road", a rural road off of Interstate 15 in Californias Mojave Desert. After digging a grave, the two find Joeys body missing from the trunk of Grants car. Grant chases Joey with a shovel in the desert, and when he finds the man hidden in an abandoned mine, Joey discloses a secret about Marissa.
