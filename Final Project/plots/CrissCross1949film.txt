Reuniting with director Siodmak after their success with Ernest Hemingways The Killers, Burt Lancaster plays Steve Thompson, a man who seals his dark fate when he returns to Los Angeles to find his ex-wife Anna Dundee (Yvonne DeCarlo) eager to rekindle their love against all better judgment. She encourages their affair but then quickly marries mobster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea). To deflect suspicion of the affair, Thompson leads Dundee into a daylight armored-truck robbery, only to "criss cross" him when the crime is pulled off.
