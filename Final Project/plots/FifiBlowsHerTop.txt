The Stooges reminisce about their wartime romances in Europe. After they finish their tales, they discover that Joes girl Fifi (Vanda Dupre), whom he left behind in Paris, has moved in next door. The only problem is that she is now married to a very evil jealous and unappreciative husband (Philip Van Zandt). Typical Stooge antics result in ruining Fifis dress, and dressing her in a pair of pajamas is an invitation for her husband to enter the scene. The husband turns out to be a real cad, and when Fifi overhears him tell about his plans to find a new wife, she clobbers him and goes back to Joe.
