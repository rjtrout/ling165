The film chronicles the life of Mr. Sanchez (Anthony Quinn) and his struggles with the culture of poverty around him. A widowed farmer, he cares for his family in a marginal area of Mexico City. While being a hard worker who feels the duty to financially support his family, he is still an aggressive, domineering man and a womanizer. His main conflict is with his daughter, Consuelo (Lupita Ferrer), a rebellious girl who attempts to break free from her oppressive father. She strives to escape her role of dutiful daughter and pursue her own dreams. Consuelo likes to talk with her grandmother (Dolores del Rio), who secretly advises her to find a man and get married. This is the only way that she, an uneducated poor woman, can escape her misogynistic father.
