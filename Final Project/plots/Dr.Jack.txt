The Sick-Little-Well-Girl (played by Mildred Davis) has been wrapped in cotton wool all her life. At the sign of the slightest sniffle or cough, she is packed off to bed and each time, the stuffy (and expensive) Dr Ludwig von Saulsbourg (Eric Mayne) is called to attend to her. In another town lives Doctor Jackson (Harold Lloyd), a friendly and altruistic doctor who is liked by everyone in town. He utilises common sense when curing the citizens of any ills. Soon, Doctor Jack discovers that von Saulsbourg has been playing on The Sick-Little-Well-Girls non-illness, charging the girls father exorbitant amounts of money to "treat" her. With Jacks intervention, von Saulsbourg is sent packing.
