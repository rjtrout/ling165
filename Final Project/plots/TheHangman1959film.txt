Marshal Mac Bovard, known as the Hangman for his success at seeing guilty men die for their crimes, rounds up three of four outlaws suspected in a robbery that resulted in the murder of his brother. Two are hanged. The third is needed to identify John Butterfield, whose face Mac has never seen. Butterfields former girlfriend, Selah Jennison, works at Fort Kenton doing laundry. She refuses to help Mac, even when he offers a $500 reward. Butterfield had been there for her after the death of her husband, so she remains loyal to him. A freight driver, Johnny Bishop, could be the man Mac is looking for, but kindly sheriff Buck Weston warns him that Bishop is one of the most well-liked men in town. Selah comes to warn the married and respectable Bishop, who swears that he merely watched the outlaws horses, not knowing they were pulling a holdup. After Bovard persuades Bishop to surrender, Selah mocks the marshal, calling him "hangman" and claiming he is not interested in the truth. Bovard, however, wants to quit being a lawman and go west to become a lawyer instead. Bishop breaks out of jail, but Mac lets him go. Buck wants to marry Selah, but she is beholden now to Mac.
