An incredibly strong ship stoker named Bill (George Bancroft) saves a beautiful prostitute named Mae (Betty Compson) from drowning during his one night of shore leave. She was attempting suicide as she had no money, almost no clothes and felt remorse about her life up to then. He steals some clothes for her and invites her out for a "good night". They go to a bustling wharf pub and that evening they spontaneously get married by a minister invited to the pub. The next morning Bill must go back to sea. Mae is disappointed, but he says he was "just having a good time". He also says he couldnt be serious about staying with her and fulfilling his marriage vows because his job keeps him at sea. Bills ship sets out, but before it leaves the city harbor, events help him to decide...he must not leave her. Swimming ashore, he goes to the tavern and asks "Where is my Wife?". One patron directs him to the local Night Court. She had been accused of stealing the clothes that he had actually stolen for her. The judge sentences her to 30 days in jail, then Bill speaks up and says that he had stolen the clothes. The irritated judge gives him 60 days for theft. Bill says he will do the time for her; as he is led away, she pledges to "wait forever" for him.
