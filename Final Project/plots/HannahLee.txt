Bus Crow (Macdonald Carey), a professional gunfighter from Texas arrives in Pearl City looking for work, where he makes an impression on the locals at "Hannahs Place", a saloon run by Hallie (Joanne Dru). This leads to him being hired by ranchers to convince squatters to leave the area. U.S. Marshal Sam Rochelle (John Ireland) is brought in to investigate some murders and suspects Crow is responsible.
