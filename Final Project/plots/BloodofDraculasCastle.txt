Count Dracula (Alexander DArcy) and his vampire wife (Paula Raymond), hiding behind the pseudonyms of Count and Countess Townsend, lure girls to their castle in the Arizona desert to be drained of blood by their butler George (John Carradine), who then mixes real Bloody Marys for the couple. Then the real owners of the castle show up, along with Johnny, who is a serial killer or a werewolf depending on which version you watch. The owners refuse to sell, so Dracula wants to force them to sell. In a final confrontation, the vampires are forced to stand in the sunlight and dissolve into dust. However, two bats emerge from the ashes and fly away. Ostensibly located in Arizona, the film was actually shot at Sheas Castle, near Lancaster, California. Other portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California.
