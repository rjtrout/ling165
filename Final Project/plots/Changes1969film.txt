Set in the 1960s, the film follows the lead character Kent (Lane), as he travels along the California coast. As he drifts, he recalls his former troubled girlfriend, Bobbi (Manuela Thiess) who committed suicide after he broke off their relationship. During his travels he meets up with different women. However, he moves along rather than stay put in hopes of finding a meaning to his life.
