The evening of July 4, in Las Vegas, Hank, a mechanic, and Frannie, a travel agent, break up while celebrating their fifth anniversary. He has been insensitive to her yearning for adventure and excitement. They both spend a night with their idealized partners â€” Hank goes with Leila, a nubile and beautiful circus girl, and Frannie goes with Ray, a dark, handsome musician. After their nights of passion, Hank breaks down, tracks Frannie to her lovers apartment and abducts her. She refuses to stay with him and walks away, saying that this time it is goodbye forever. Hank follows her to the airport, where Frannie is about to leave for her dream trip to Bora Bora. Hank sings to her to prove he is willing to be more romantic, but she boards the plane, saying it is too late. Hank, distraught, goes home and is about to burn her clothes when Frannie returns, realizing she "made a mistake."
