In London, a shape charge-wielding master criminal comes up with a foolproof plan for robbing a bank and outwitting Scotland Yards pursuit, but during the getaway he hides his haul in a radio set in the new flat of Capt. Bulldog Drummond (John Howard) and his to-be wife Phyllis Clavering (Heather Angel), leading to a murder, punch-ups, an expedition to France, a night in a French jail cell and a break-out, in a race to reach Bulldogs fiancee. Phyllis is waiting for Drummond in a French village with her aunt Blanche Clavering (Elizabeth Patterson (actress)), to be married the next day. She has sent a telegram, asking him to send her the radio, both unaware of its content. The villains meet their end in a roof-top fight and Bulldog finally ties the matrimonial knot in an explosive finale to his bachelorhood.
