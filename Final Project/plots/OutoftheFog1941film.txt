Two aging men, Goodwin and Johnson (Mitchell and Qualen), are fishermen in their spare time. They are trying to buy a new boat, but their Brooklyn pier is controlled by Goff, a gangster (Garfield), who extorts "protection" money of $5 a week from them. Goodwins daughter (Lupino) falls in love with Goff, who learns that Goodwin has tried to persuade her to holiday in Cuba. After he demands $190 from them, the sum Goodwin had promised his daughter, the fishermen plan to kill the gangster, but neither can go through with the act. The gangster attempts to strike one of them but falls into the sea and drowns. Goff turns out to have been a wanted man in five cities, and they recover the extorted money.
