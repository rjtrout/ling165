Set in 1958, the coming-of-age story follows four Brooklyn teenagers known as The Lords of Flatbush. The Lords chase girls, steal cars, play pool and hang out at a local malt shop. The film focuses on Chico (Perry King) attempting to win over Jane (Susan Blakely), a girl who wants little to do with him, and Stanley (Sylvester Stallone), who impregnates his girlfriend, Frannie (Maria Smith), who pressures him to marry her. Stanley agrees to marry her, even after finding out before the wedding that Frannie never was pregnant. Butchey Weinstein (Henry Winkler) is highly intelligent but hides his brains behind a clownish front, while Wimpy Murgalo (Paul Mace) is a colorless follower in awe of Chico and Stanley.
