In June 1983, in Dutchess County, New York, Sebastian Cole joins his mother, stepfather, and sister for dinner where Hank, Sebastians stepfather, drops a bomb: he announces that he is having a sex change operation. Sebastians sister, Jessica, leaves immediately for California, and his mother, Joan, takes him back to England. Eight months later, Sebastian is back in New York, knocking on Hanks door. Hank (now Henrietta) takes Sebastian in and supports him over the next few months of high school. Sebastians "adventures" are mostly self-destructive.
