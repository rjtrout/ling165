The film is a lightly fictionalised account of Basquiats life. Initially a struggling artist living in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square Park., he works his way up the rungs of the New York art world in the eighties, thanks in part to his association Andy Warhol (David Bowie), the art dealer Bruno Bischofberger (Dennis Hopper), poet and critic Ren√© Ricard (Michael Wincott), and fellow artist Albert Milo (Gary Oldman). Alongside the development of his artistic career, the film also follows Basquiats tumultuous relationship with Gina (Claire Forlani), a fellow aspiring artist he meets whilst she is working as a waitress at a diner he frequents with his friend Benny (Benicio del Toro). Their romance is affected by Basquiats affair with the so-called "Big Pink" (Courtney Love), a woman he picks up on the street, and his habitual abuse of heroin. Eventually, Basquiat finds himself isolated by his fame, the death of Warhol and his drug use. The film ends with a title card informing the audience that Jean-Michel Basquiat died of a heroin overdose on August 12th, 1988, at the age of 27.
