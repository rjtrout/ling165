Burglars Molly Brian (Marie Prevost) and Joe Hagney (John Patrick) break into the Vickers mansion on Long Island and loot the safe but are caught in the act by another crook, Jerry Winters (Clive Brook), who takes the money from them. The three are confronted by Pious Joe McDowell (Claude Gillingwater) and his wife Mamie (Mathilde Brundage), also crooks, but who assert themselves as friends of the Vickers family. Moly, Joe, and Jerry introduce themselves in turn as Vickers household servants. A doctor (Dan Mason) arrives with his patient (Heinie Conklin) and quarantines the house. Unknown to the first five, the Doctor and patient are also crooks who use the ruse of a "quarantine" as part of their own methodology. During the brief quarantine, Molly ends up falling in love with Jerry and the two pledge to go straight. When the police (Fred Kelsey) finally arrive, Pious Joe takes responsibility for the robbery so that Molly and Jerry can escape.
