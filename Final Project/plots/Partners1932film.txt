Dick Barstow owns a horse ranch. When he comes upon a traveling salesman, Carry-All Roach, and his grandson, Bud, being harassed by Chet Jarvis, he intervenes, breaking up the incident. He invites the salesman to stay at his ranch to recover from the incident. Over dinner, Barstow and Roach become friendly, and when Roach learns that Barstow needs $1,500 to get himself out of a financial jam, he loans him the money. The next day Barstow goes to pay off his debt, which is to the father of Jean Morgan, his girlfriend. Returning to his ranch, he finds Roach by the road, dead. When he reports the murder to the local sheriff, he falls under immediate suspicion of having robbed and murdered Roach, since there is no proof that Roach loaned him the money with which he paid off Mr. Morgan. Intending to prove his innocence, Barstow evades incarceration. He returns to the site of the murder, where he finds a distinctive piece of a boot, which he recognizes as having belonged to Jarvis. Now suspecting Jarvis of the murder, Barstow heads to Jarvis motel room to search for evidence. There, he uncovers Roachs empty wallet. Barstow rides back to his ranch, where Jarvis is attempting to claim that he is Buds legal guardian. When confronted with the empty wallet, it is further discovered that Jarvis has a military medal of Roachs which he used to carry in his wallet. Revealed as the murderer, Jarvis attempts to flee, but is captured by Barstow. Returning to his ranch, Barstow and Jean cement their relationship, and state their intention to raise the young Bud.
