Most of the story takes place in Switzerland, where Templar interrupts his holiday to retrieve a missing secret code. The key to the mystery is a Swiss music box with a most unusual tune, diligently sought after by enemy agent Rudolph (Cecil Parker) and British secret service operative Valerie (Leueen MacGrath). Templar is aided in his investigation by reporter Mary Langdon (Sally Gray) and Monty Hayward (Arthur Macrae), with Inspector Teal (Gordon McLeod) of Scotland Yard.
