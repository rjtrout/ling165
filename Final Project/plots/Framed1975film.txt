Returning home to Tennessee from a trip to Texas, nightclub owner and gambler Ron Lewis happens across a shooting and is nearly shot himself. A deputy confronts Lewis as he arrives at his home. He accuses Lewis of being involved in the shooting and roughs him up, resulting in a fight that ends up in the deputy being killed and Lewis being badly beaten. Lewis is placed under arrest for the death of the deputy. Corrupt cops, including a thieving sheriff, and lawyers (including his own) ignore Lewis claim of self-defense and railroad him into a prison sentence of up to 10 years. His girlfriend Susan is sexually assaulted and warned not to aid Lewis defense in any way. Behind bars, Lewis is befriended by mob boss Sal Viccarone and hit man Vince Greeson. He is paroled after four years and immediately sets out to get even with those who wronged him. Vince, also out of prison, is contracted to kill Lewis, but decides to help him instead, as does a law-abiding deputy, Sam Perry. Lewis proceeds to torment and even torture the guilty parties in a number of ways, gaining his revenge and finding out the truth about what really happened the night of the roadside shooting.
