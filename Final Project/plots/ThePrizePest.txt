After listening to one of his favorite radio programs, Porky Pig receives a grand prize from the station. Out of the gift box pops Daffy Duck, who insists on living in Porkys house. After numerous attempts to throw Daffy out of the house, Daffy devises a plan to stay. He tells Porky that he has a split personality (รก la The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) When people treat him with kindness he becomes sweet and cuddly, whereas when treated badly, he turns into a hideous monster, which he does by messing his hair up and putting in fangs. Getting the idea, Porky promises to be nice to Daffy and then begins to treat him like a servant. Porky then intends to call the authorities about Daffy without him knowing, only to be outsmarted by Daffy who impersonates as the phone. Daffy puts up his monster guise on and chases Porky around the house. When Porky realizes hes been had (after coming out scared from a closet with a skeleton in it, presumably put in there by Daffy), he now has to outsmart this psychotic duck and get him out of the house by dressing up as a monster. When Daffy sees the monster ("Sufferin catfish, I never realized I was THAT hideous. IM NOT!"), he becomes so scared, he falls apart (literally) and runs out of the house screaming (putting himself back in the gift box in the process). When Porky accidentally sees himself in the mirror in his monster costume (which he stated that only a craven little coward would be scared of), he scares himself so much that he jumps onto a chandelier ("So Im a craven little coward").
