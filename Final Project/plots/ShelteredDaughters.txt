As described in a film publication, the story involves an underworld plot to defraud givers to a charity for French orphans. Jenny Dark (Johnstone), who greatly admires Joan dArc, supposedly the wife of a French officer, at a banquet collects $200,000 for the French orphans. Jennys father Jim (Hatch) is a plain clothes man, so the crooks do not get away. However, when Jim goes to arrest the impostor, he finds his daughter Jenny in the room with him. However, soon all is explained.
