In the year 2044, a news reporter named Kay interviews Lancer a few hours before his scheduled concert. Lancer recalls the events leading to the Third Robotech War, along with his prior involvement with the 10th Mars Division and his association with the band of rebels that helped defeat the Invid forces. After the interview, he starts his concert with a rendition of Lynn Minmeis "We Will Win". Following the concert as Lancer sits alone at night and only thinks to himself, he is surprised by his returning family. Scott, Marlene/Ariel, Rand, Rook, Lunk, and Annie all take him out for a campfire dinner and talk about what the REF has been up to in the aftermath of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles. Lancer denies an invitation from Scott and Rand to join them on the fleets new mission to find Admiral Hunter and the SDF-3, giving his own valid reason as they all head off for some sleep. Lancer remains awake and leaves his family behind. He drives through the country while back at his small cabin, Sera prepares breakfast for her returning love. As he returns, Lancer and Sera reaffirm their devotion and Sera reveals to him that she is expecting their first child soon.
