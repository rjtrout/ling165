While serving time in jail, Major Manning wins a mine in New Mexico from a fellow inmate. Upon his release, he hatches a scheme with several of his former associates to use the mine, which he believes worthless, to con rich New Yorkers. His first contact is with his old partner, Steve Dorsey, who has married a wealthy socialite, Nancy. Dorsey listens to Mannings plan, and agrees to head up the bogus investment company, having become bored with his suburban life. In order to induce the wealthy to invest in their bogus scheme, they hire an unwitting accomplice as their head of their company, Malcolm Winthrop. Winthrop adds legitimacy to the group since he was the financial editor of newspaper in Yonkers. After they hire Winthrop, they convince Nancy to invest most of her money in the scheme. When Winthrop starts to become suspicious of his new partners, he travels to New Mexico to physically inspect the mining operation. He discovers that contrary to what Manning believes, it is actually potentially very profitable. He convinces Nancy to fund the project, and he buys up all the outstanding shares in the mine, gaining total control. By the time Manning understands what is going on, he is shut out of the mine, which turns into a moneymaker. Dorsey is forgiven by Nancy, and the two reconcile.
