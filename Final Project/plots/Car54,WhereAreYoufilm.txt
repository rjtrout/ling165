Partnered in Car 54 are the amiable, unreliable Gunther Toody and the prim, proper Francis Muldoon, who wants to know, among other things, if Toody has been helping himself to free kebab from the neighborhood food vendors. As everyone gets on their case, including Dave Anderson, their captain, an assignment comes their way. Toody and Muldoon are told to protect citizen Herbert Hortz, who apparently has incurred the wrath of the local crime godfather, the claustrophobic Don Motti. And while the cops from Car 54 ineptly do their jobs, Toody gets an earful from his wife, Lucille, and is hot and bothered by a woman all their colleagues seem to have already frisked or handcuffed, the vixen Velma Velour.
