College professor John Hathaway is writing a book about jealousy and how he doesnt believe in it. He isnt the least bit perturbed, for example, when his lovely wife Julie is the object of desire in the eyes of the schools football star, Rubber Legs Ryan. John goes to New York to meet with publisher Elliott Morgan and meets associate Nellie Woods, who loves Elliott but cant get him to commit. Elliott is infatuated with Johns wife Julie, but after a while he realizes that she is faithful to her husband. Julie, though, continues to be irked at Johns complete lack of jealousy. A misunderstanding leads to John being placed under arrest. Elliotts failure to help him or to contact lawyer Freddie Bond as promised is maddening to Julie, who wants John to knock his block off. She also catches John and Nellie in an embrace and turns red with jealous rage, which puzzles John because they were merely celebrating his book sale. Nellies threat to quit finally gets Elliott to propose, but one day John finally explodes and strikes him, which leads to a fight between the two women, too. By the time a total stranger calls his wife "sugar" on the street, John is ready to come up swinging.
