Shoftly after becoming engaged to a socialite, an upper-class American named Terry enlists in the US Marine Corps to get his wild urges out of his system. He and his two friends and comrades get into many scrapes, frequently ending up in the brig. While in Cuba, however, he falls in love with Nenita a spirited, passionate local woman. Their relationship is interrupted by Americas entry into World War I, and Terry is wounded in the fighting in France. He is nursed back to health by his fianc√©e and the two marry. More than a decade later, Terry bumps into his former comrades in New York. This reawakens memories of his carefree days in Cuba. He returns to Havana to find Nenita, only to discover that she has died of fever. However he comes across a boy named Terry, who he realizes is the product of his passionate relationship with Nenita a decade earlier. He adopts the boy and takes him back to the United States where his wife generously welcomes both father and son home.
