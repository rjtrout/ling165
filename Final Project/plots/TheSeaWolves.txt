During World War II, German submarines are sinking thousands of tons of British merchant shipping. British intelligence, based in India, believes that information is being passed to the U-Boats by a radio transmitter hidden on board one of three German merchant ships interned in Goa, then a colony of Portugal. Portugal was neutral during the Second World War; the ships cannot be attacked by conventional forces. The head of the Indian section of Special Operations Executive authorises attempts to kidnap and interrogate two known German agents, but these operations both fail. An approach is then made to a territorial unit of British expatriates, the Calcutta Light Horse, to carry out the mission on its behalf. They all volunteer â€“ all are trained in military skills and keen to do their bit. Whilst the volunteers are trained, Stewart and Cartwright travel covertly to Goa. By a mixture of blackmail and bribery, they arrange diversions on the night of the raid. A party is to be held in the Governors palace, a brothel will offer free entry to sailors from the German ships and a fiesta will be held. Stewart has a brief affair with Mrs.Cromwell, a mysterious and socially well-connected woman, who turns out to be a German agent and the main conduit for information, known to the Germans and the British by the code-name Trompete (Trumpet). She is eventually killed by Stewart, after she attempts to kill him. The raiding party sail around the coast in a decrepit and barely seaworthy barge; they set mines on the hull of the German ship in Goa. They then board, catching the depleted crew off-guard. Despite Pughs order that there be no shooting, several German sailors are killed. The ship is set alight and the party withdraws, watching as the ship sinks.
