A government intelligence agency in Washington, D.C., wants agent Frank Sanford to follow Boris Mitrov, a film producer who appears to also be a Russian spy. Helen and Adrian Benson, a wealthy American couple with a home in Beverly Hills and a film studio, are Communist sympathizers as well, in league with Colonel Vadja Kubelov, the top KGB man in the U.S. Boriss office is bugged by his assistant, Bob Avery, a plant who is working for the Americans. Now that he has been caught red-handed, Boris is willing to turn double agent, going to Berlin in the pretense of making a documentary film there. Helen is having an affair with Kubelov, but the Bensons home has been bugged and they try to flee to Mexico. In the meantime, Boris is sent to Moscow to be entrusted with a new assignment, so Avery gives him a code word ("Cinerama") in case hes ever in danger. Upon learning that Adrian intends to expose Boris and Kubelov publicly, Avery is able to alert Boris to get back to Germany as soon as possible. A checkpoint is closed, but Boris shoots a police officer and escapes safely to West Berlin, only to end up in a fight for his life with a Russian assassin.
