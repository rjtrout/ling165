During the last civil-military dictatorship in Argentina, the military government is abducting those opposed to its rule. Cecilia, a dissident journalist living in Buenos Aires, is kidnapped by the secret police to join the ranks of the disappeared. Cecilia had earlier published a provocative article in her outrage over the forced disappearance of students protesting the bus fares. As her husband Carlos, a theatre director, begins to search frantically for her, he realizes that he has acquired psychic power that enables him to predict the future. This not only puts Carlos in high demand by those who have also lost a loved one, it also helps Carlos foresee what happens to his wife and other detainees. At one point, Carlos visits the Naval Mechanics School, the notorious torture center.
