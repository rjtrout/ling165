Artie Decker, a sports commentator for the minor-league Fresno Grizzlies, is fired due to his old school talk and lack of social media. He and his eager-to-please wife, Diane, agree to babysit their three grandchildren, Harper, Turner, and Barker in Atlanta when their daughter, Alice, and son-in-law, Phil, go away for an entrepreneur exhibition. Problems arise as their parenting skills collide with Alice and Phils helicopter parenting. After learning of the childrens various problems, such as Harpers high achievement syndrome, Turners stutter, and Barkers imaginary friend Carl, they try to make them their new best friends. Alice eventually returns home when her boss gives her an assignment to redesign the website for the X Games. Artie uses this to his advantage, as he arranges an interview for the role of sports commentator. He manages to place Barkers life in danger when he nearly gets hurt by a skateboard ridden by Tony Hawk. Eventually, the tension comes to a head as Alice disagrees with Dianes letting Harper attend a party the night before a recital and the death of Carl. Alice eventually reconciles with Artie and Diane, and she allows Harper to withdraw from the recital. Turner takes her place in it and resolves his stutter by reciting the commentary from the Shot Heard Round The World. Afterwards, Artie and Diane successfully become a major part of their grandchildrens lives, with Artie taking up a new job as a commentator for a Little League Baseball team along with Turner.
