Cathy Timberlake, a New York City career woman, meets Philip Shayne after his Rolls Royce splashes her dress with mud while she is on her way to a job interview. Philip proposes a romantic affair, while Cathy is holding out for marriage. Watching from the sidelines are Philips financial manager, Roger, who sees a therapist, because he feels guilty about helping his boss with his numerous conquests, and Cathys roommate, Connie Emerson, who knows what Philip is seeking. Philip wines and dines Cathy. He takes her to see the New York Yankees play baseball. They watch from the Yankees dugout (he owns part of the team). Cathys complaints about the umpire while seated alongside Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Yogi Berra (playing themselves) cause umpire Art Passarella to throw all of them out of the game. Philips conscience weighs on him, so he withdraws an invitation to Bermuda, which only serves to make Cathy agree to go. While in Bermuda, anxiety-ridden over the evenings sexual implications, Cathy comes down with a nervous rash, much to her embarrassment and his frustration. The Bermuda trip is repeated, but this time Cathy drinks to soothe her nerves and ends up drunk. While intoxicated, Cathy falls off the balcony onto an awning below. She is then carried in her pajamas through the crowded hotel lobby. At the urging of Roger and Connie, who are convinced that Philip is in love with her, Cathy goes on a date with Beasley, whom she dislikes, to make Philip jealous. Her plan succeeds and she and Philip get married. On their honeymoon, he breaks out in a rash.
