Slade, a serial killer, is a lodger in a 19th-century familys London home. So is a singer, Kitty Langley, who definitely has caught Slades eye. Women are being brutally killed in the Whitechapel district. Scotland Yard is investigating and a detective, John Warwick, begins to cast his suspicions in Slades direction. Kitty, meanwhile, has also developed an attraction to Slade. Slade goes to see her perform at a cabaret. He goes backstage afterward and tries to make her his next victim, but Warwicks men get there just in time. Unwilling to be taken into police custody, Slade flees to the riverbank and leaps to his death.
