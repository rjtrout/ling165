Charles Piper (Laurence Fishburne) and Luke Dodge (Stephen Baldwin) are two convicts who end up shackled together due to fighting while on work detail. Another prisoner, Mill, who incited the fight, steals a gun from an officer and wipes out half of the officers. Piper and Dodge escape and soon the Attorney Generals office has U.S. Marshal Pat Schiller (Robert John Burke) on the case. Informed of the escape, local cop Matthew "Gib" Gibson (Will Patton) starts getting suspicious of the feds interest in Dodge, whom Gibson had earlier arrested. Gibson finds that Dodge has a hidden computer disk that contains information that could be very damaging to Cuban crime boss Frank Mantajano (Michael Nader). Piper, who turns out to be a cop on the case, and Dodge must stay out of the clutches of Mantajanos hit man Rico Santiago (Victor Rivers), and corrupt federal agents who want to retrieve the disk.
