Rosalind (Margaret Lindsay) returns to her Miami home following a divorce to see her boyfriend Johnny Norton (Don Douglas). They visit nightclub Club Havana, where Johnny tells Rosalind that he has fallen in love with another woman. Saddened, Rosalind tries to kill herself, but Bill Porter (Tom Neal) prevents her from doing so. Meanwhile, Jimmy (Eric Sinclair) has discovered that Joe Reed (Marc Lawrence), who murdered club performer Julia Dumont, has been released as the police believe there is not enough evidence that Joe killed her. Although Jimmy witnessed the killing, he is afraid to see police, fearing that Joe will go after his girlfriend Isabelita (Lita Baron). Jimmy instead decides to phone the police, but Myrtle (Sonia Sorel) listens in on the phone call and informs Joe of Jimmys actions. Joe gets a hired killer to murder Jimmy, but the killer accidentally shoots Myrtle while Jimmy ends up hitting the gunman in his car. As Jimmy goes to the police station to testify, Johnny and Rosalind decide to get back together and go home.
