Four intellectually disabled men share a house and are looked after by Jack (Tony Goldwyn), their social worker. The four men try to make sense of a mixed-up world, dealing with everything from runaway rodents to helping Norman (Nathan Lane), who has a new girlfriend (Mare Winningham). Jacks life with his wife is put on hold, and he feels its time to let them go.
