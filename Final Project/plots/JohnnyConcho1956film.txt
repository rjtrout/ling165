The mean and boastful Johnny Concho is also a coward, but the people of Cripple Creek, Arizona, let him have his way. They know that Johnnys brother, who doesnt live in town, is the notorious gunfighter Red Concho, someone they truly fear. Mary Dark, daughter of the general stores owner, is in love with Johnny, but isnt yet aware of the kind of man he really is. Johnny has everyone so cowed that, in a card game, he neednt even show his hand to claim the pot. That lasts until the day a man named Tallman comes to town. Tallman calls the bluff of Johnny at the poker table. Johnny wants the sheriff, Henderson, to take care of this, but Tallman stuns everyone by announcing that he recently stood up to Red Concho in another town and killed him. Exposed for the yellow-belly he is, Johnny rides off. Mary still loves him and follows, but wherever Johnny goes, word reaches that he is not a man to be trusted or feared. Tallman, meanwhile, has taken over Johnnys role in Cripple Creek, appointing himself as the law and demanding to be paid a percentage from every business in town. Mary still wants to marry Johnny, but at the wedding his cowardice comes out once more. A man who knew his brother informs him that Red was actually just like Johnny, a blowhard with no guts. Johnny pulls himself together and returns to Cripple Creek to face Tallman in the street. Tallman wounds him, but the townspeople are impressed by Johnnys bravery and willing to help. Marys father shoots Tallman and kills him. Johnny prepares to leave town, knowing hes not wanted here, but Mary and the others invite him to stay.
