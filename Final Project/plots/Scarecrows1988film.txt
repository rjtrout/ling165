Five bank robbing paramilitary mercenaries and war criminals steal three million dollars from Camp Pendleton and take two hostages, a pilot and his daughter. As the robbers fly toward Southern waters, one of the robbers steals the loot, and parachutes into a dark field. The remaining robbers land the plane, and head for a broken-down house. The house has a demonic history, which causes scarecrows guarding surrounding graves to become animate and slaughter all trespassers, dooming their victims to live on as scarecrows for all eternity.
