David Burke (Ed Begley) is a former policeman who was ruined when he refused to cooperate with state crime investigators. He has asked Earl Slater (Robert Ryan), a hard-bitten, racist, ex-con, to help him rob an upstate bank, promising him $50,000 if the robbery is successful. Burke also recruits Johnny Ingram (Belafonte), a nightclub entertainer. He doesnt want the job but is addicted to gambling and is deeply in debt. Slater, who is supported by his girlfriend, Lorry (Shelley Winters), learns that Ingram is black and refuses the job. Later, he realizes that he needs the money, and joins Ingram and Burke in the enterprise. Tensions between Ingram and Slater increase as they near completion of the crime. Burke is seen by a police officer leaving the scene of the raid, and is mortally wounded in the ensuing shootout with local police. He commits suicide, shooting himself to avoid capture. Slater is cavalier about Burkes death, which infuriates Ingram. Slater and Ingram begin to fight each other even as they try to evade the police. Ingram and Slater escape and run into a nearby fuel storage depot. They chase each other onto the top of the fuel tanks. When they exchange gunfire, the fuel tanks ignite, causing a large explosion. Afterward, their burned corpses are indistinguishable from each other. The last scene focuses on a sign at the entrance of the fuel storage depot saying, "Stop, Dead End".
