The story follows John Belushi (Michael Chiklis), shortly after his death from a drug overdose in March 1982, as he awakens in a morgue and is about to undergo an autopsy. Panicked, Belushi escapes and finds himself in the company of the enigmatic Angel Velasquez (Ray Sharkey), a Puerto Rican cabbie who takes Belushi to significant moments in his life from the beginning of his career to the courtship of his wife, Judith (Lucinda Jenney), into his burgeoning comedy career, his friendship with Dan Aykroyd (Gary Groomes) and his eventual decline. The film alternates between Belushi as a ghost and his journey with Velasquez to flashbacks (in non-linear style) as his career gains momentum. Meanwhile, journalist Bob Woodward (J. T. Walsh) is researching Belushis life as he prepares to write a book about the late comic actor. Woodwards investigation leads him to Cathy Smith (Patti DArbanville), who procured drugs for Belushi, and the story climaxes with Woodward directly conversing with Belushi during the actors dying moments.
