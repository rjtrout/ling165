At the end of the American Civil War, Confederate soldier Tom Dooley (Landon) leads an attack on a stagecoach, unaware that the war was already over. Dooley is declared to be a murderer but he returns to his hometown hoping to marry his fianc√©e, Laura Foster (Morrow). Trouble soon breaks out and he and Laura are forced to elope, pursued by lawman Charlie Grayson (Hogan) who also has romantic interest in Laura. Tom and Laura get married and attempt to escape to Tennessee, but are soon captured by Grayson. Dooley is locked up in the town jail after a quick trial where he is sentenced to be hanged in the morning, but escapes with the help of one of his confederate army friends "Country Boy". Grayson catches Laura as she tries to reunite with Dooley. Grayson tries to force himself on Laura, but is interrupted by the arrival of Dooley and Country Boy. In the ensuing fight Laura is accidentally stabbed while Dooley and Grayson struggle with a knife, and then Grayson and Country Boy shoot each other. Laura dies in Dooleys arms as the sheriff arrives and recaptures Dooley, who is then led off to his execution.
