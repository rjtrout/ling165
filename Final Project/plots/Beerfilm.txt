Cynical ad executive B. D. Tucker (Loretta Swit) is desperate not to lose the account of the financially ailing Norbecker Brewery. When three losers (David Alan Grier, William Russ, and Saul Stein) inadvertently prevent a robbery in a bar, Tucker and her minions give them a macho image and center an entire ad campaign around them.
