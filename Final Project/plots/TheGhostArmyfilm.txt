The documentary tells the history of the secret U.S. Army unit of 1100 troops that was set up in 1944 and operated until 1945 in the final stages of World War II in the fight against German troops in various parts of Europe. They used a combination of different ways of visual, sonic and radio deception to convince the enemy of the presence of specific Army units that were in fact operating elsewhere. The unit included a large number of visual artists and designers who documented their experiences in paintings and sketches. The material employed in the 23rd Army Headquarters Special Troops operations included decoys such as inflatable rubber tanks and jeeps as well as powerful loudspeaker trucks playing sound recordings of troop activity.
