Max (Cummings) and his father (Bruce) are both looking to marry wealthy women, which would be easier if either one of them had any money of their own. Max decides on Martha (Hussey), but Martha says no when he says that he is poor as she admits she is also. So she accepts the proposal of Sir Kelvin (Owen), but changes her mind by the next day. When Florian tries to win money gambling for Maxs wedding, he loses a bundle. When Max finds out about the debt, he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Joan (Anderson) to keep Florian out of jail.
