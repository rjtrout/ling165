The action is set in 16th-century France. Diane de Poitiers (Lana Turner) becomes the mistress of Prince Henri (Roger Moore), second in line to the throne. Their liaison continues through Henris arranged marriage to the Italian Catherine de Medici (Marisa Pavan). Unknown to Catherine, her Medici relations arrange the death of the Dauphin and Henris ascent to the throne as King Henry II. The antagonism of the two women, abetted by Medici scheming, eventually results in the death of Henri. Catherine, now ruling as regent for her three young sons, banishes Diane but spares her rivals life in a gesture of mutual respect.
