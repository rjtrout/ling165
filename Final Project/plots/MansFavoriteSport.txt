Roger Willoughby is a well-known fishing expert who works as a salesman for Abercrombie & Fitch Co, at the time an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents. Abigail Page is a brash and flighty public relations woman. Page is determined to secure Willoughbys participation in a prestigious fishing tournament, only to discover that Willoughby is a phonyâ€”hes never fished in his life. By threatening to reveal his secret, Abigail forces Roger to fake his way through the tournament. Willoughby proves himself to be supremely inept: he cannot fish, cannot set up a tent, cannot run or even board a motorboat. He cannot even swim, as he demonstrates by toppling or plunging straight to the lakebed each time he ventures to go fishing. In the vein of the screwball genre, the dialog is fast and overlapping, the humor broad and slapstick, multiple levels of deception abound, and a decidedly adversarial relationship constantly teeters on the edge of romance.
