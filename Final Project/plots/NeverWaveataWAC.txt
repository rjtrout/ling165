A divorced socialite and daughter - Jo McBain (Rosalind Russell) - of a United States senator - Andrew McBain (Paul Douglas) - would like to join her boyfriend, who just left for Paris, where he has been transferred, with two other military comrades. After speaking with her father, he has the idea of her joining the army and getting her an officers commission in the Womens Army Corps, so that she can be near her officer boyfriend and thereby be transferred to Paris. He sells her this idea, telling her that she would start as a general. Her wealthy and spoiled manners are crushed immediately, when arriving at basic training camp she is told that she would have to start at the bottom. Her father is involved in the telephone chain of people making the decision. Her ex-husband is working as an Army uniforms designer, and he uses his position to disrupt her romantic plans by making her join a group of girls who are testing polar equipment. After she has had enough of her ex-husbands silly pranks, she blows up at her commanding officers and is to be dismissed from the Army. Her contrite ex-husband admit his faults to the disciplinary hearing, but Jo confesses that she was faking being a good soldier so she could go to Paris and be with her boyfriend. She leaves the Army, but she made a lifelong friend in Clara, who tells Jo she will ask her boyfriend to marry her. When she leaves the Army, Jo watches as new recruits are brought in. She realizes that shes still in love with her ex-husband (and he with her). She decides to enroll back into the Army, a genuine attempt at being a good soldier this time, willing to do what the Army ask her to do. She says that later, after her graduation, she may be stationed near Andrew, her ex-husband.
