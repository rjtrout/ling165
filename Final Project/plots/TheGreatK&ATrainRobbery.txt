Following a series of robberies of the K & A Railroad, detective Tom Gordon (Tom Mix) is hired to uncover the mystery. Disguised as a bandit, Tom boards the train of K & A President Cullen. Cullens daughter, Madge, senses that Tom is not a criminal and soon falls in love with him. Madge is sought after by Burton (Carl Miller), her fathers secretary, who is in league with the bandits. Tom eventually discovers his duplicity, and with the aid of Tony, his horse, rounds up the villains and wins the hand of Madge.
