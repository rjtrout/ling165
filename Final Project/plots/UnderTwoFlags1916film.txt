As described in a film magazine, British nobleman Bertie Cecil (Heyes) takes upon himself the blame for his brothers forgeries and, when supposed dead, enlists in the French Foreign Legion, serving in Algiers. There he wins the friendship of Emir, a native whose wife he had saved from the lust of his commanding officer. Old friends visit Algiers and recognize Bertie, and urge him to return and claim his own. His refusal leads to a scene where he strikes his commanding officer, and for this he is condemned to death. Cigarette, the "daughter of the regiment," rides to obtain a pardon for Bertie and makes a terrific trip through a sand storm. She arrives too late with the reprieve, but just in time to receive in her own body the bullets intended for Bertie.
