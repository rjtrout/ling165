Set during the Korean War, the film depicts the atrocities of battle. Sgt. Garth (Barron), an egomaniacal, blood thirsty leader, neglects to tell his soldiers that there has been a cease fire. The Sergeant sends his unit into an enemy bunker, where they are fiercely attacked by the enemy. The few who survive secure the bunker, and Garth attempts to take credit for their actions. Further chaos ensues, resulting in the deaths of many in the platoon, as well as the mortal wound to the Sergeant himself.
