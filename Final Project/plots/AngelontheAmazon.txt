They include pilot Jim Warburton, who is fascinated by the woman, Christine Ridgeway, as well as relieved when she and guide Paulo steer him and Karen, a doctor, away from the jungle and its threatening war drums. Upon reaching Rio de Janeiro safely, Jim and Karen are surprised to encounter Christine again, then shocked when the sight of a strange man causes her to panic. Jim eventually follows the man, who identifies himself as Don Sebastian Ortega and tells a strange tale of how Christines mother once shot a panther, then killed herself. Christines father then left her behind. Jim returns to the United States and finds Anthony Ridgeway, who reveals that Christine is not his daughter but his wife. Jim also eventually learns that Christine has become committed to a sanitarium, where she is now under Karens care.
