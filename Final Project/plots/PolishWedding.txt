Jadzia is the matriarch of a family of five children, four sons and a daughter. The household also includes the eldest sons wife – a Syrian-American whom Jadzia calls a Gypsy and who also works with Jadzia – and their child. Jadzia is (somewhat) happily married to Bolek, but is having a long-term relationship with Roman. Her daughter Hala becomes pregnant by a neighborhood cop and her family pressures him to marry her. The interior of the familys home was shot in a local house on Wyandotte Street in Hamtramck. The St. Florian Church was used as a backdrop.
