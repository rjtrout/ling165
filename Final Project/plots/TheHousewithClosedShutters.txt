During the American Civil War a young soldier loses his nerve in battle and runs away to his home to hide; his sister puts on his uniform, takes her brothers place in the battle, and is killed. Their mother, not wanting the shameful truth to become known, closes all the shutters (hence the films title) and keeps her sons presence a secret for many years, until two boyhood chums stumble upon the truth.
