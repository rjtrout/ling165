Max Clement and his father Florian, short of money, take advantage of wealthy British women by romancing them. Maxs problem is that he is far more attracted to more attractive women, ones without the means to support him. While seeing a pleasant but plain Lady Joan Culver socially, Max is introduced to Austrian widow Rosine Brown, quickly falling in love with her. Max is persistent in his romantic advances, but Rosine reveals that she is penniless and, much like Max, counting on a richer but less exciting man, Sir George Kelvin, to marry and take care of her. Florians gambling losses in the casino leave him heavily in debt. The only way Max knows how to aid his father is by marrying Lady Joan, who can afford to solve his financial difficulties. Maxs guilty conscience and true love lead him back to Rosine, and the sudden engagement of Florian to a wealthy woman helps bring everyone together.
