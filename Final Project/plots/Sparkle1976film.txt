The movie begins in Harlem, New York in 1958, and follows the girl group, Sister and the Sisters, which is made up three sisters: Sister (Lonette McKee), Sparkle (Irene Cara), and Delores (Dwan Smith). Stix (Philip Michael Thomas), Sparkles love interest and the groups manager, is able to help bring the group from "amateur nights to brief stardom before tragedy (dope, melancholia, the wrong man)" ensues and the group splits. Stix gives up on his music career and leaves the city and thus breaking Sparkles heart. Sister is in an abusive relationship and is hung up on drugs while Delores leaves the city in pursuit of racial equality. In the end, after reconnecting after Sisters funeral, it is only Sparkle and Stix who climb the ladder to success. In short, this is a rags to riches story.
