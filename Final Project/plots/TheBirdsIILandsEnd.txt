Ted and Mary Hocken (Brad Johnson and Chelsea Field) move to a remote, windswept, tiny East Coast island with their two young daughters; the Hockens are determined to forget their painful past of losing their son and spend a quiet, uneventful summer. But as immense flock of birds begin massing around Gull Island, it becomes clear that something is very wrong in this isolated, deceptively calm oasis and fear mounts as a marine biologist is the target of a mysterious, grisly attack. Before long, the sky is darkened by a hideous onslaught of screeching birds. It is an assault unlike anything in the history of man or beast â€“ except for an old timer who recalls a similar, horrific outbreak that gripped the West Coast three decades ago in Bodega Bay, California.
