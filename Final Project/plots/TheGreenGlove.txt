Mike Blake (Glenn Ford) is an American paratrooper who travels to France after the end of World War II to try to recover a jewel-encrusted glove that had been stolen from a country church during the war. His quest leads him to a beautiful young tour guide (Geraldine Brooks), and a Nazi collaborator (George Macready) whom he had fought during the war.
