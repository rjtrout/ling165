Louis Hozenozzle and 2d Lieut. Rodney Ramsbottom, two American soldiers, are stationed in Switzerland after World War I. Ramsbottom is in love with Colette, a pretty Swiss girl, and when he receives orders to leave Switzerland he orders Hozenozzle to remain there to protect Colette. General Lavoris, a Swiss, also desires Colette, but she spurns him. Returning home, he has a fake order issued stating that all unmarried women must immediately take husbands. At her request, Hozenozzle marries Colette. Ramsbottom then receives a letter from General Lavoris telling him that he has been doublecrossed, and the lieutenant immediately returns to Switzerland and challenges Hozenozzle to a duel. Colette intercedes, explaining that she married only to save herself from Lavoris. The mayor grants Colette a divorce from Hozenozzle, but all the suitors lose her to a handsome young major. [4]
