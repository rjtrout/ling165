November 9, 1965: Margaret Garrison (Doris Day) is a stage actress who has spent her career starring in virginal roles, although she would relish the opportunity to play someone less savory, such as an Italian prostitute, at least once before she retires. When a blackout shutters her current Broadway play for the night, she returns home unexpectedly and discovers her architect husband Peter (Patrick ONeal) being overly attentive to attractive reporter Roberta Lane (Lola Albright). Infuriated, she heads to the couples weekend house in Connecticut and takes a concoction to fall asleep. When corporate embezzler Waldo Zane (Robert Morse), fleeing New York with an attache case full of money, develops car trouble near Margarets weekend house, he lets himself in and unwittingly takes some of the elixir himself, falling into a deep sleep beside her. Peter shows up, sees the two together and assumes his wife has been unfaithful. Despite their claims of innocence and ignorance, Peter believes neither of them and heads back to Manhattan. Margarets agent Ladislaus Walichek (Terry-Thomas), anxious because she has announced her plan to retire, keeps her husbands jealousy burning in the hope their marriage will crumble and shell be forced to continue working to support herself. Margaret and Peter eventually reconcile, but new questions about what really happened when the lights went out arise when she gives birth exactly nine months after that fateful night.
