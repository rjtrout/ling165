A strange and sinister man, Mr. Cato (Orson Welles), wields extraordinary power in the small town of Lilith. The townsfolk indulge in weird rituals in their pursuit of necromancy, bring the dead back to life. Against this disturbing background a beautiful young girl, Lori (Pamela Franklin), becomes the human catalyst. She is married to Frank (Michael Ontkean), one of Catos workers, and holds the key between life and death: what Cato and his followers have in mind is using Lori to bring back Catos dead son.
