A distraught Joe Palooka doesnt want to fight any more after believing he killed an opponent in the ring. Joe doesnt know that gamblers John Mitchell and Howard Abbott conspired to drug the victim by blackmailing his manager, Max Steele, who unwittingly caused the boxers death. Joes manager Knobby Walsh and a pal, Sam "Glass Jaw" Wheeler, fail to console Joe, but the dead boxers fiancee, singer Nina Carroll, explains to Joe how he wasnt responsible. Joe proceeds to help police investigate the crime. It turns out Sam is actually an undercover cop. A furious Max ends up killing Mitchell out of revenge. Nightclub owner Abbott, after hiring Nina to sing, plots to have Joe killed in his upcoming bout by once again using a poisoned mouthguard. Knobby and a helpful dog save Joe just in time.
