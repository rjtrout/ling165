Amanda, an employee at an upscale clothing store, is leading a relatively lonely and unremarkable life. All this changes when an alien thats been held at a secret military installation escapes by taking over the body of one of the base employees. Amanda finds the fugitive alien and decides to help it hide from the government agents chasing it, a seemingly easy task, as the alien must change host bodies every few days. It is based upon the short story of the same name written by Robert Silverberg.
