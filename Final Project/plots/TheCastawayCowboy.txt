Texas cowboy, Lincoln Costain (James Garner), gets "shanghaied" in San Francisco, then jumps ship and washes ashore on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, right into the arms of widow Henrietta MacAvoy (Vera Miles) and her son (Eric Shea) who are struggling to make a living as farmers. A lot of wild cattle often trample their crops, so Costain gets the idea to start cattle ranching instead. The Hawaiian farm hands dont readily take to the American cowboy culture, and Calvin Bryson (Robert Culp), is a banker with eyes to grab Henriettas land and maybe Henrietta herself.
