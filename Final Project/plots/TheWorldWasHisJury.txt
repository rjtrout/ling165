A cruise ships captain dies and Jerry Barrett is promoted to replace him. On the way to New York City, the vessel catches fire. Barrett is knocked unconscious by falling debris, first officer Martin Ranker tries to save the ship but 162 passengers die. Barrett is prosecuted for criminal negligence. Attorney David Carson agrees to represent him, infuriating wife Robin, who resents Carson trying to free guilty clients and declares that she is leaving him. Rankers testimony damages Barrett and another witness insinuates the interim captain was drunk. An armed man tries to shoot Barrett in the courthouse, and a crew member discredited by Carson on the stand is later found stabbed to death. Carson discovers that certain crewmen falsified their documents and had criminal records. Ranker, a 40-year veteran, resented being passed over for the captaincy and hired men to commit arson, never meaning the blaze to go so under control. He confesses on the stand, Robin returns to Carson and the defendant goes free.
