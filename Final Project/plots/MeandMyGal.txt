In this wisecracking comedy, Dan Dolan (Spencer Tracy) is a cop whose beat is the New York waterfront. Dan has a soft spot for Helen Riley (Joan Bennett), a sharp-tongued waitress at a cheap diner, while her scatter-brained sister Kate (Marion Burns) is in love with Duke Castage (George Walsh), a sleazy low-level mobster. While Duke makes a play for Kate, both Helen and Dan know that hes bad news, and Dan wants to put Duke behind bars before he can break Kates heart. Me and My Gal was directed by Raoul Walsh, one of the great craftsmen of the studio systemâ€”and also the brother of George Walsh, who plays the villain.
