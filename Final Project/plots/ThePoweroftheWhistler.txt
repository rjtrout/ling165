Dix plays an amnesiac who learns about his name and past through the help of amateur fortune teller Jean Lang (Janis Carter). The fortune teller sees the mysterious-looking man when she is in a restaurant with her sister and the sisters boyfriend. Without meeting him, she predicts that he will be near death twice in the coming day. Outside the restaurant, she saves him from being struck by a car. It is then that he realizes he has no memory of his past. Charmed by his pleasant, cultured manner, she resolves to help him uncover the mystery of his life. She continues to do so, even as she encounters signs that they may find something scary.
