Blossom (Pam Grier), a buxom bad girl, is the rough-and-ready girlfriend of a radical guerrilla leader, Django (Sid Haig). She rather keeps her relationship a secret, but is also quick to start a fight without knowing it. However, when Djangos mercenary friends itch for some female companionship, she softens and the two devise a plan to liberate the inmates of a local womens prison. A woman named Terry (Anitra Ford), a social climber, ends up in the prison herself because of Blossom and Djangos earlier robbery. She is now forced to deal with crazy inmates, gay guards, and torture of the cage. Terry, Blossom, and Django (who busted in by seducing Rocco, one of the guards) eventually come together to face off against the warden Zappa (Andr√©s Centenera) to stage an explosive breakout.
