Once the commanding officer of a cavalry patrol is killed, the ranking officer who must take command is an army doctor. The patrols sergeant convinces the doctor to impersonate a military (rather than medical) commander, to avoid embarrassment while passing an infantry troop. The plan backfires when the colonel leading the infantry troop orders the doctor, who maintains the ruse, to lead "his" cavalry troop into hostile territory.
