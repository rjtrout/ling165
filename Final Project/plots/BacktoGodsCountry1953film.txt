In the late 1800s in the remote western regions of North America, sinister businessman Paul Blake and his helper Frank Hudson kill an Eskimo, steal his map and viciously beat his sled dog. Schooner captain Peter Keith and wife Dolores arrive with a cargo of furs. Blake and Hudson conspire to keep Keiths boat in dock until conditions are too icy to sail. Blake wants the captains goods and his wife as well. After persuading two of Keiths crew to abandon ship, Blake kills the boats cook. He also attacks Dolores, which leads to a fight with Keith. Hudson is secretly plotting to forge a will that will result in his inheriting all of his partners money, but nevertheless he comes to Blakes rescue in the fight, seriously injuring Keith. Traveling by sled to a fort where he can receive desperately needed medical attention, Keith and his wife must overcome an attack by wolves, an avalanche and a guide who only pretends to be their friend. Blake finds the fake will and kills Hudson, then sets out after Keith, only to fatally encounter the Eskimos loyal dog.
