The time frame of the film is 1505-1530: Luthers entrance into St. Augustines Monastery in Erfurt to the presentation of the Augsburg Confession. It recounts Martin Luthers struggle to find Gods mercy: his discovery of the gospel in Romans 1:17, the posting of the Ninety-five theses, and the subsequent controversy, which led to Luthers being separated from the church of Rome. It shows Luthers resistance to the forces of radicalism, and his work to establish and maintain the evangelical movement of his day. The dramatic climax of the film is Luthers "Here I Stand" speech before the 1521 Diet of Worms, and the grand finale is the singing of "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" by Luthers congregation.
