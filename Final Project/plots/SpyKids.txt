Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez are rival spies who fall in love. They retire and have two children, twelve-year-old Carmen and nine-year-old Juni. They work for the Organization of Super Spies (OSS) doing desk work. The children have no idea of their parents previous career. Ingrid and Gregorio are called back into the field when agents go missing. The children are left in the care of Uncle Felix Gumm. Gregorio suspects that childrens television host Fegan Floop has kidnapped the agents and mutated them into his "Fooglies," creatures on his show. They are captured by Floops "Thumb-Thumb" robots whose arms, legs, and head resemble oversized thumbs, and taken to Floops castle. Felix is alerted to the parents capture, activates the fail-safe, tells the children the truth, and that he is not their uncle but an agent. The house is assaulted by Thumb-Thumbs, and the children escape alone on a submarine set to auto-pilot to a safe house. At the safe house, Carmen unlocks the door using her full name, and the children learn of their parents past as they decide to rescue them. Inside of Floops castle, he introduces his latest creation to Mr. Lisp, small robots in the shape of children. He wishes to replace the world leaders children with these super-strong robots to control the world. The androids are "dumb", and cannot function outside of their inherent programming. Lisp is furious, demanding usable androids. Floop, along with his second-in-command Alexander Minion, interrogate Gregorio and Ingrid about The Third Brain. Ingrid knows nothing of the subject, while Gregorio claims that he destroyed the brain years ago. After Floop leaves, Gregorio reveals to Ingrid that the Third Brain was a secret OSS project he once worked on: an AI brain with all the skills of the entire OSS. The project was scrapped as being too dangerous, but Gregorio couldnt bring himself to destroy the final prototype. Back at the safe house, the kids are visited by Ms. Gradenko. Gradenko says she works for OSS, and is there to help the children. Gradenko wants the Third Brain, but Carmen does not know anything about it. Gradenko orders the house to be dismantled, and Juni sees Thumb-Thumbs outside destroying the submarine. Gradenkos intentions revealed, Juni accidentally exposes the Third Brain, and a chase ensues with Carmen and some henchmen with jet packs. Carmen eventually gets the brain, and she and Juni escape the Thumbs. Carmen realizes too late that the bracelet Gradenko gave her was a tracking device, and she and Juni are attacked by their robot counterparts. Though Juni tries to destroy it he is unable and the androids fly off with the Third Brain. With it Floop can achieve his goal, but he wishes to continue his childrens show. Minion has different plans and takes over, locking Floop into his "virtual room," the chamber where he films his television series. The kids receive reluctant help from Gregorios brother Isador "Machete" Cortez when they come to his spy shop, steal some of his gear, and take his spy plane to fly to Floops castle. While their children storm the castle, Minion takes Ingrid and Gregorio to the "Fooglilizer," the machine which has mutated the other OSS agents into Fooglies. Gregorio reveals that Minion used to work for the OSS but was fired after Gregorio reported him tampering with the Third Brain project. Juni rescues Floop and then their parents. Together they trap Minion on the Fooglilizer and, confronting Lisp and Gradenko, the family is beset by 500 robots. Machete busts through the window, and joins the family to fight. However, at a crucial moment, Floop is able to reprogram the androids to change sides. The 500 super-strong androids quickly overpower Lisp and Gradenko. With advice from Juni, Floop introduces the android children on his show. The familys breakfast is interrupted by Devlin who has a mission for Carmen and Juni. Carmen accepts on one condition: that the Cortezes work as a family.
