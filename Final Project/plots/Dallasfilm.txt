Blayde Hollister (Gary Cooper) is a former Confederate out to revenge himself on a group of carpetbaggers who murdered his family and destroyed their home in Georgia. With the help of his friend Wild Bill Hickok (Reed Hadley), Hollisters death is faked and he accompanies and swaps identities with Federal Marshal Martin Weatherby (Leif Erickson). Martin is an inexperienced dude from the East using the position of Marshal to impress his fianc√©e Tonia (Ruth Roman), whose Mexican family is being terrorised by the same gang that murdered Rebs family and terrorised Georgia. Hollister posing as the dude Martin protects both men and lets them get closer to the carpetbaggers.
