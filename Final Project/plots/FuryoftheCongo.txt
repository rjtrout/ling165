Adventurer Jungle Jim (Johnny Weissmuller) is traversing the jungles of the Congo when he notices a plane diving towards the river. The agile explorer rescues the injured pilot, Ronald Cameron (William Henry), from the deep waters. Cameron tells Jim that he is trying to find missing biochemistry professor Dunham, under the University of Cairos request. Dunham was last seen venturing into the jungles in search of a beast known as the Okongo. The Okongo, half-antelope and half-zebra, is greatly revered by the tribal natives of Congo and its glands are rumoured to contain a rare type of drug. Jungle Jim and Cameron later discover from a tribal chief, Leta (Sherry Moreland), that Dunham has been kidnapped by hunters who wish to extract the drug from the Okongos glands. Jim, Leta, and Cameron make their way to the hunters hideout. Halting their sinister plans, Leta lets loose the captured Okongo. It proceeds to kill one of the hunters. A fight ensues and during the scuffle, Professor Dunham smashes all the bottles of extracted Okongo drug. The trio of Jungle Jim, Leta, and Cameron flee. They encounter a sandstorm and Jim engages in a battle with a gigantic desert spider, before returning to save Dunhams life. The professor, having been shot by one of the hunters, is left in Cameron and Letas care. Dunham shockingly recognises Cameron as the leader of the notorious hunters. Too late, they all get captured by Cameron and his henchmen. Jim is commanded to bring the hunters to the main herd of Okongos. Just as they arrive, however, the hunters are attacked by both the natives and the Okongos. Cameron manages to escape but falls from a cliff and dies. Leta and the natives savour their victory, and Jungle Jim and Dunham make their leave.
