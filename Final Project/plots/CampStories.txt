In the summer of 1958, 15-year-old David Katz is constantly defying authority figures at the Orthodox Jewish summer camp he is enrolled in. He especially riles the paranoid camp counsellor Chaim (Marcoux) who believes David is having an affair with his wife. The adolescent antics continue with the boys arranging midnight rendezvous at the girls camp.
