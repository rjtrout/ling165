The song talks about safe sex, the positive and negative sides of sex and the censorship that sex had around that time in American mainstream media. The song was later included in the trios Greatest Hits (2000) album. It samples "Ill Take You There" by the Staple Singers. An alternate version of the song entitled "Lets Talk About AIDS" was released to radio on a promotional single and included as a b-side on various singles for the song. The lyrics were changed to more directly address the spread of AIDS and HIV.
