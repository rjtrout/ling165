Dorky executive Nelson Hibbert (Foley), who gets passed over for a promotion after spending years (including marrying one of his bosss daughters) attempting to curry favor. Upon hearing this, he ends up shouting "Ill kill you!" as security drags him from the board room. Later, when he goes to confront his boss (Kenneth Welsh), he finds that the man has already been murdered, and, due to the scene he made earlier, assumes that he will be mistaken for the murderer. Nelson flees, unaware that security cameras have already revealed the identity of the true killer to the authorities. Nelson tries to escape to Mexico, but along the way he meets both the real killer (Feore) and the murders investigator, Detective Arlen (Higgins), who Nelson believes is trailing him. Chaotic events transpire and Nelson meets a narcoleptic farm girl, Lynn Holden (Tilly). What follows is a bizarre series of misadventures marked with slapstick routines and constant one-liners.
