The plot revolves around the death of Captain Nordahl, on a factory ship in Antarctic waters, lost overboard in mysterious circumstances. Captain Nordahl is an associate in a Norwegian whaling company, Bland-Nordahl. Duncan Craig (Alan Ladd), an American meets Judie Nordahl (Joan Tetzel), the captains daughter on his way to South Africa where he gets even with a business partner who cheated him. With little money left and a desire to see Judie again, Craig signs on to be a mate on the ship taking Judie to Antarctica. On arrival in Antarctic waters, Craig finds suspicious evidence that seems to implicate skipper Erik Bland (Stanley Baker), the new captain of the factory ship, in a conspiracy. Another murder follows and the film concludes with a dramatic showdown on the ice.
