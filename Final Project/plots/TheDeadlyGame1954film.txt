While holidaying in Spain, Philip Graham (Bridges) by chance runs into an old wartime RAF colleague Tony Roscoe (Peter Dyneley), now a society photographer. The pair spend some time reminiscing, before Tony is urgently called back to England on business. Tony is required to fly home, so Philip offers to drive Tonys car back from Spain at the end of his holiday. Tony asks him to also pick up an envelope he has left in the hotel safe. After Tonys departure, Phil is attacked in a case of mistaken identity while driving Tonys car. When he reports the attack, a local police inspector (Roger Delgado) and a mysterious hotel guest Darius (Currie) both tell him that since his discharge from the RAF, Tony has become embroiled in suspicious and probably criminal activities and has been under surveillance. Back in England, Phil goes to return the car, only to find Tony dead on the floor of his darkroom. Phil becomes the prime suspect and, realising that the key to the case must be the contents of the envelope he has in his possession, sets about investigating on his own account. He quickly becomes drawn into a world of extortion and industrial espionage, focussed on a stolen medical formula which many people seem to want to get their hands on. Along the way he romances the enigmatic Mitzi (Silva) and also falls into the sphere of influence of sultry temptress Marina (Maureen Swanson). Developments lead him back to Spain, where he finally manages to crack the mystery.
