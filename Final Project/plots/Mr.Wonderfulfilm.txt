Gus (Matt Dillon), an electrician, wants to purchase a bowling alley with his friends. The problem is that he still pays alimony to his ex-wife, Leonora (Annabella Sciorra). Gus realizes that if Leonora remarries, he can stop paying alimony, and attempts to match Leonora with various men. James Gandolfini has a small part as one of Lenoras would-be suitors. In the course of his match-making, and after Gus breaks up with his girlfriend, Rita (Mary-Louise Parker), Gus and Leonora discover that they still care about each other.
