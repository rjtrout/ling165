Egomaniacal and temperamental Victor Fabian is the London Festival Orchestras conductor. His wife Dolly is a harpist who acts on her husbands behalf, presenting his impossible demands to the symphonys backers, only to then find him dallying with a considerably younger musician. Dolly decides to leave him, whereupon he destroys her harp. Victors conducting suffers in Dollys absence and the orchestra needs her back. His agent, Max Archer, tries to get him a new contract, but young Wilbur, son of the orchestras patron saint, insists to Victors horror that any agreement must include a performance of his mothers favorite piece of music, John Philip Sousas Stars and Stripes Forever. Rather than return, Dolly wants a divorce so she can marry Dr. Richard Hilliard, a physicist. An angry Victor blurts out that to be divorced, two people must first be married. It turns out colleagues only assumed Victor and Dolly were husband and wife, and they never actually tied the knot. Victor wont grant a quick marriage and equally quick divorce unless she agrees to live with him for three more weeks. He wears down her resolve, and Hilliard catches her in a frilly nightgown. A frustrated Dolly tells both she just wants to live alone. She applauds from the audience as Victor, with great reluctance, launches the orchestra into a rousing Stars and Stripes Forever.
