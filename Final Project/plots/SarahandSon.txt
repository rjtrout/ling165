After years of abusing his Austrian immigrant wife Sarah Storm, Jim Grey, a vaudeville entertainer, disappears with their young son Bobby. He eventually sells Bobby to a wealthy couple, the Ashmores. They refuse to return the boy and attempt to return in his stead the deaf mute son of one of their servants. Bobby, unhappy with the too protective Ashmores, runs away to live with his uncle Howard Vanning, a successful attorney. Years later, Sarah has become an internationally famous opera singer being courted by Howard, who engineers an encounter.
