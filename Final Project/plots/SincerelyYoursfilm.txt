Tony Warrin is a very successful pianist who can play practically any kind of music, from classical to boogie-woogie. He has one career-defining ambition left, which is to play at Carnegie Hall. Although his manager Sam Dunne and secretary Marion Moore--who secretly loves him--feel Tonys playing has never been better, he decides to go see Zwolinski, the music teacher who made him the musician he is today. There he encounters Linda Curtis, who mistakes him for Zwolinski and explains why she wishes to learn the piano. In a whirlwind courtship, Tony takes out Linda socially and also performs on the piano for her. He proposes marriage, but since they just met, Linda asks for more time. Before a concert appearance in San Francisco she makes the acquaintance of Howard Ferguson, a soldier who has just returned home and intends to resume his career as a composer. A concert date at Carnegie Hall is finally arranged, only to have tragedy befall Tony--a sudden loss of hearing. It is explained to him that an operation could either cure him or leave him totally deaf. Shaken by this turn of events, Tony turns reclusive and even suicidal inside his New York City penthouse. He learns lip-reading and begins to observe strangers in Central Park, including a young boy, Alvie, who also needs an operation. The boy helps persuade Tony to take a risk, so he undergoes surgery and his hearing returns. He also spies Linda through binoculars with Howard and realizes they are in love, but Linda has been staying with Tony out of sympathy for his situation. Tony plays a Carnegie Hall concert and gives the couple his blessing. When he sees the loyal Marion, he realizes that they can have a future together.
