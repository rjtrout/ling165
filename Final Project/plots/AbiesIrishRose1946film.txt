Stationed in London, the American soldier Abie Levy falls in love with a young lady, Rosemary Murphy, and they get married. Their families are not informed, and when the time comes for Rosemary to return to the United States, the only thing Abie tells his father Solomon is that he has met a girl and is in love. Solomon takes a liking to Rosemary but assumes she shares the same faith. A wedding is planned, no one else yet told that the couple are already husband and wife. The bride-to-bes father, Patrick Murphy, arrives, under the false impression that his daughter intends to wed an Irish Catholic man named McGee. Once the truth is revealed, neither father is on speaking terms with the children or each other. A year goes by and Rosemary gives birth. Family friends, the Cohens and an Irish priest, coax the grandfathers into finally making a visit. A baby boy, given the name Patrick Levy, promptly delights Patrick Murphy but disappoints Solomon, at least until the babys twin sister, Rebecca, is also brought into the room. Rebecca being his late wifes name, Solomon is pleased, and the families finally come together.
