T. F. Stockwell (Herbert Rawlinson) steals the money and jewelry contents of safe deposit boxes of the Cairo bank in which he works. After fleeing south in a private plane with his young daughter Doreen (Jackie Newfield, daughter of the director) and the pilot, theyre brought down in the jungle during a storm. The three survive the crash but Stockwell murders the pilot when he sees the stolen loot. Whilst exploring the surroundings, Doreen finds a gorilla (Ray Corrigan) wounded and left for dead by members of a safari. Years pass when Ray Gorman (Buster Crabbe) comes to the area on the fringes of the jungle where the plane crashed. Bar owner Carl Hurst (Barton MacLane) and his female associate Marie (Fifi DOrsay) spy on Gorman to see what hes up to. Gormans father was head of the bank that Stockwell worked for and robbed; when Gormans father was blamed for the theft he committed suicide. Gorman is out to recover the loot from the plane crash to clear his fathers name. When Gorman saves Hursts servant Tobo (Prince Modupe) from being murdered by another African (Fred Toones), Tobo confides in Gorman that there is a white witch in the jungle who legend has it came from the sky. Gorman realises that this could be a reference to Stockwells plane crash and disappearance. Tobo offers to lead Gorman to the area whilst Hurst and Marie secretly follow. The "white witch" is the grown up Doreen (Julie London) living with her gorilla named Samson who protects her; her father having long ago disappeared in the jungle.
