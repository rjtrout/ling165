The cartoon begins with a mother buzzard instructing her children to go out and catch something for dinner. They set off right away except one with his back turned. This is Beaky Buzzard (Killer) who is shy and a little on the slow side. Against his will, his mother kicks him out of the nest with instructions to at least catch a rabbit. Beaky spots Bugs Bunny and soars down to catch him. Bugs makes like an air-traffic controller and "guides" Beaky to the ground with a crash. After some heckling, a chase ensues ending with Bugs crashing into the ground underneath the skeleton of a dead animal. He cries because he thinks hes dead ("Gruesome, isnt it?", he briefly confides to the audience in a Jerry Colonna-like aside), but it turns out he knew he was okay the whole time (because his feet was sticking out of the ground). Beaky and Bugs jitterbug together. Bugs says, "Why dont we do this more often," to which Beaky replies, "Ya mean just what were doing tonight?" This is a quote of the first line of the song "Why Dont We Do This More Often?" After the dance with Bugs, Beaky ends up underground with the skeleton above. He screams "Oh, MA!" and his mother shows up. At first the mother buzzard thinks Bugs did something to Beaky. Bugs pulls Beaky out of the ground. Noticing that Beaky is unharmed, the mother abandons her desire to eat Bugs and declares him her hero and kisses him. A blushing Bugs imitates Beaky.
