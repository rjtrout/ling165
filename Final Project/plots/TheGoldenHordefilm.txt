In 1220, Sir Guy of Devon (David Farrar) and a small band of English crusaders arrive at Samarkand in Central Asia. The city and its ruling princess Shalimar (Ann Blyth) are threatened by Genghis Khan (Marvin Miller) and his hordes. Shalimar hopes to defeat the conqueror by guile, whilst Sir Guy prefers to put up a brave (if ultimately futile) fight. Despite the mutual attraction between Shalimar and Sir Guy, their differing methods threaten any hope either may have of victory.
