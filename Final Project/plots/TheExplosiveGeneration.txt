The story is about Peter Gifford, a teacher who wants to teach high school students to think for themselves and express themselves. A female student pushes to have open classroom discussion about the physical and emotional issues associated with teenage relationships and sex. This issue gets blown out of proportion by parents who dont have the facts and jump to ill-informed conclusions, demanding sanctions against the mostly innocent teacher, who keeps still on the matter to protect the involved students. The entire student body rallies in a Gandhiesque silent protest that helps everyone learn to appreciate the truth of the matter.
