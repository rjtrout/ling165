The Stooges are skilled veterinarians at a pet hospital who are the proud surgeons of Garçon, a prized poodle of socialite Mrs. Bedford (Isabelle LaMal). They successfully remove a thorn from his paw. Dognappers posing as reporters (Lynton Brent, Cy Schindell) dognap Garçon. Before the kidnapping crime is discovered, the trio attempts to enjoy a dinner of bones and dog biscuits at a long table with all the other dogs who are patients at the hospital. Its during the meal that a nurse discovers Garçon is missing. The boys frantically try to trick Mrs. Bedford by disguising a mutt as Garçon. However, when Mrs. Bedfords maid (Libby Taylor), who is frightened of dogs, accidentally vacuums a clump of glued-on fur off the mutts shaggy coat, Mrs. Bedford threatens to throw the Stooges in jail. Desperate, the trio use the mutt as a bloodhound to track down the crooks. When they discover the enemies hideout, a big fight ensues. Larry and Moe get knocked out, but then Curly defeats both crooks. The boys hear Garçon quietly barking from inside a closet, only to discover that the prized poodle has had a litter of pups.
