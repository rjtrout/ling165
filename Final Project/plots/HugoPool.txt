Hugo Dugay (Alyssa Milano) runs a small company, Hugo Pool, that cleans swimming pools in Los Angeles. The film covers one day in her life, during which she must clean many pools in the midst of a drought that interferes with her usual water supply. In addition to dealing with several eccentric customers, including mobster Chick Chicalini (Richard Lewis) and filmmaker Franz Mazur (Robert Downey Jr.), Hugo must care for her needy parents Minerva (Cathy Moriarty) and Henry (Malcolm McDowell). Also, Hugo may be falling in love with Floyd Gaylen (Patrick Dempsey), a customer of hers who has ALS.
