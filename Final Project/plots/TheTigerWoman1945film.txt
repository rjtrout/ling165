Nightclub singer Sharon Winslow tells a detective, Jerry Devery, that her husband owes gambler Joe Sapphire a lot of money and fears he will be killed. Sapphire insists to the cop that the debt has been paid in full, but when Sharons husband is found dead, suspicion understandably falls on Sapphire. It turns out the dead man left a suicide note, but Sharon and her lover, her husbands business partner Stephen Mason, destroy the note so that Sharon can claim it was a murder and collect the insurance money. Sharon is, in fact, the murderer, and she double-crosses Mason as well. A suspicious Jerry decides to romance Sharon just to be able to get closer to her. They go away together on a train, where Sharon pulls a gun on Jerry and admits that he was right about her. His police colleagues then come out of hiding to place her under arrest.
