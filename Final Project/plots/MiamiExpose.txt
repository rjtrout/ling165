Miami police lieutenant Bart Scott informs his captain of his plans to retire. His fiancee, Ann Easton, a widow whose husband was killed in the line of duty, refuses to marry Bart until he quits the force. The captain is murdered by a gunman who also is found dead. The gunmans wife, Lila Hodges, witnesses the crime. She becomes of grave concern to many in Miami with criminal ties, including attorney Raymond Sheridan, who is offering lobbyist Oliver Tubbs a million-dollar bribe to get Miami gambling legalized, and gangster Louis Ascot, who offers Lila sanctuary and takes her to Cuba. Scott manages to get to Lila and persuade her to return to Miami to testify. When she expresses reluctance to do so, he parades her in public, where thugs attempt to killer. Convinced that she has to help, Lila is taken to Scotts home in the Everglades to remain in hiding until the trial, but when Ascot comes after her, Lila and Ann end up armed and trying to hold off the gunmen until Scott can arrive with reinforcements. Sheridan, meanwhile, after double-crossing Tubbs, is killed by him.
