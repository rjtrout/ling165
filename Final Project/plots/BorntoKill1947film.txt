Helen Brent (Claire Trevor) has just received a Reno divorce in Nevada. That night, she discovers one of her neighbors, Laury Palmer (Isabel Jewell), and Palmers gentleman caller Danny (Tony Barrett), both murdered in Palmers home. The killer is Palmers other boyfriend, Sam Wilde (Lawrence Tierney), an insanely jealous man who wont abide anyone "cutting in" on him. Helen says nothing to the police; shes leaving town and doesnt want to be impeded. She runs into Sam and is instantly attracted to his self-confidence and brutality, but she is engaged to marry a wealthy boyfriend, Fred (Phillip Terry). Sam wants to call on her in San Francisco. He arrives there and meets Georgia Staples (Audrey Long), Helens foster sister, also rich. Sam soon shifts his attentions to her, marrying the sister for her money after a whirlwind romance. Neither Helens engagement nor Sams marriage is an impediment to their beginning an affair. Meanwhile, back in Reno, the owner of the boarding house where Helen lived has hired a mercenary, verse-quoting detective, Albert Arnett (Walter Slezak), to find out who killed Laury. The detective follows Sams friend, Marty (Elisha Cook Jr.), to San Francisco, where he soon begins to make blackmailing overtures to Helen. Marty finds out who hired the detective and attempts to kill her, but Sam thinks hes trying to cut in on his action and kills Marty. Fred is troubled by the resulting police investigation, as well as by Helens increasingly heartless demeanor. He calls off their engagement. Sam and Helen face off in a fatal confrontation as their schemes begin unraveling, with Sam fatally shooting Helen before he is slain by police.
