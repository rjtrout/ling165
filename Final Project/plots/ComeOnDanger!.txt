Jim Madden, a Texas Ranger, is gunned down while investigating the murder of a local rancher. His younger brother, Larry, vows to track down the suspected killer, another rancher named Joan Stanton. While looking into the murders, he stumbles on a battle between Stanton, and a group of men working for another rancher, Frank Sanderson. Rescuing Stanton from the altercation, he keeps his identity as a Ranger secret, while attempting to learn the truth of what is going on. Through talks with Stanton, Madden learns that Sanderson has been setting her up for both the murder of the other rancher, and Jims death. Convinced by Stantons story, Madden tells Stanton she must turn herself in, and she agrees. Before they can reach the Rangers, they are captured by Sandersons men. Sanderson plans to kill Madden, and take Stanton to Mexico. With the help of Rangers cook, Rusty, as well as several of Stantons men, Madden overcomes Sanderson and his men, and takes a vindicated Stanton back to the Rangers.
