Bo Hooper (Lewis), a clown, finds himself unemployed when the circus where he works suddenly closes. He winds up living with his sister (Susan Oliver), against the wishes of her husband Robert (Roger C. Carmel). From there he goes from job to job, wreaking havoc along the way. He finally finds some stability as a postal worker, until he finds out that his boss is his girlfriends father. The father hates all mail carriers because his daughters ex-husband was one, so he tries to wreck Bos life, but Bo overcomes the odds and succeeds not only at work, but at impressing the father.
