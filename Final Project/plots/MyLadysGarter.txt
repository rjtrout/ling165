As described in a film magazine, a jeweled garter with an interesting history disappears under mysterious circumstances from the British Museum. The Hawk, a criminal who has never been apprehended even though he obligingly leaves many clues for the police to follow, is suspected. Helen Hamilton (Breamer), daughter of a wealthy American, loses her jewels after throwing them out of a window at Keats Gaunt (Craig), a poet she imagines she is in love with. A tiff with Gaunt follows and she dives into the sea, being rescued by a strange gentleman in a yacht who gives his name as Bruce Calhoun (Standing). English detectives suspect him of the robbery and watch him closely. He goes to Helens home and becomes acquainted with her family, but his mysterious actions raise doubts in the minds of all save Helen, who now loves him. Not even to her, however, will he admit his part in the mysterious proceedings that are occurring continuously until, by a master stroke, he catches the criminal, a rival for Helens affections, and then reveals that he is an American secret service man and worthy of her love.
