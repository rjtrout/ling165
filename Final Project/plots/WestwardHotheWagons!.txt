A small group of families join together to travel to Oregon in 1846. Their leader is ostensibly James Stephen (George Reeves, TVs Superman), who has made the trip before, and is now bringing his family along. John Grayson (Fess Parker, TVs Daniel Boone), known as Doc for his ambition to study medicine, however, proves to be the real leader of the wagon train. The pioneers deal with the elements and occasional raids, but after hostile Pawnees drive off their spare horses, they realize they may not make it to the Oregon Territory. While stopping at Fort Laramie, the pioneer children make friends with Sioux children. After the Sioux chiefs son is injured in an accident, Doc Grayson helps heal him, earning the trust of the Sioux. As the story ends, the Sioux warriors escort the wagon train safely through Pawnee territory.
