In 1945, after Helen Brandt (Laraine Day) and her mother (Ann Harding) moves from the small town of Ellsworth Falls to New York City, Helen finds a job as a perfume clerk at a department store while Mrs. Brandt works for the war relief effort. Jerry (Bill Williams), a boy just home from serving in France, likes Helen, but she only thinks of him as a "pal". His college buddy, USAAF Lieutenant Hank Travers (Robert Young) hears all about Helen, and worms his way onto a date that Jerry and Helen are on, asking Mrs. Brandt to go along. At the dance, when the band plays "Those Endearing Young Charms", her mother begins to cry, confiding in Helen that it reminds her of Jerrys father, who she loved and lost. After taking Helen and Mrs. Brandt home that night, Hank makes a play for Helen, but she sees he is a womanizer and sends him home. The next day, Hank calls Helen, and tells her he wants to see her before he is shipped out. While she is attracted to Hank, Helen fears that he is insincere, but her mother says not to do what she had done, and lose her chance at love. On a drive out to the seashore, Hank tries once more to convince Helen he is serious about their relationship, even admitting that he had lied about being shipped out. Helen returns home, telling her mother she really is in love with Hank. When his two-day pass is suddenly cancelled, Mrs. Brandt tells her to go to him before he flies back to the front. At his airfield, the two young lovers reunite, minutes before Hank is to take off. Helen promises to wait for him.
