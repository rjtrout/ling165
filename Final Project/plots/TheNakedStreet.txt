Phil Regal, a tough racketeer, pulls strings to get his sister Rosalies punk boyfriend, Nicky, out of a death penalty for a murder he did in fact commit, so that they can get married. Later, when he learns that Nicky is cheating on Rosalie, he arranges for Nicky to be framed for a murder he didnt commit. Farley Granger later said that he thought the movie was "preachy, trite and pedestrian," although he welcomed the opportunity to work with Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft.
