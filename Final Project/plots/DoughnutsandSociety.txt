Belle Dugan (Maude Eburn) and Kate Flanagan (Louise Fazenda) are partners in a doughnut business. When Belle gets $50,000 to sell her mine to a mining company for potential gold, she is brought into society and wealth with her daughter Joan (Ann Rutherford). She leaves Kate behind with her son Jerry (Eddie Nugent) behind at the doughnut business. Although they left on bad terms, Belle invites Kate and Jerry to a party at their new mansion, all while Kate where’s very uncomfortable shoes. When she sits to take them off, a dog snatches them and she embarrassed herself in front of everyone at the party. Belle kicks her out, and Joan and Jerry leave on bad terms, in defense of their mothers. That same night, Jerry has a brilliant money-making idea, a layer parking garage. They make a cake as a diarama and they start their garage business, as well as get into society and wealth just like Belle and Joan. This time, however, Kate has the party and invites Belle and Joan to HER mansion. Again, they leave on bad terms, as well as Joan and Jerry. Soon, Kate and Jerry sell the company because they were sabotaged by a businessman who’s offer to buy out the business was rejected. As a result, they were forced to sell the company to another businessman. Now they are out of wealth and back to the doughnuts when all of a sudden, just before Joan is to marry a Frenchman, the same woman that came and gave Belle the $50,000 for her mine comes and tells her they didn’t find any gold, just water. Now, Joan and Jerry get married and Belle and Kate are back where they started, at the doughnut business!
