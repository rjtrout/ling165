The Stooges are singing waiters in a saloon out West, accompanied by three cowgirls. Unfortunately, saloon keeper Maxey (Dick Curtis) is surly and patronizing to the hard working girls. The girls have little choice, as they are forced to work for him because their father is in debt. The Stooges vow to make enough money to pay off the debt and wed the girls, and decide to go prospecting for gold. Unknown to the Stooges, however, Maxey has recently robbed a bank and buried the loot. Before they find the stolen treasure with the stocks and gold bonds, the Stooges have a mishap, when a rock hits Curly, and thinking that it was Moes doing, throws a rock at Moe, causing Moe to throw a stick of dynamite, which lands near Yorick, the burro. When their dog takes the stick of dynamite and puts it into the box of canned food supplies, Moe thinks that Yorick ate the dynamite and tries to have the burro drink from a bucket of water, before the explosion. In their digging, the boys managed to discover Maxeys stash, thinking they are truly in the dough. They return to town, but Maxey gets his hands on the money and flees the saloon. The Stooges, of course, catch up with Maxey, retrieve the loot, and end up giving back to the bank from whence it came, much to their astonishment.
