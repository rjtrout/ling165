Newspaper editor Brad (Paul Muni) learns that the head of the governors investigating committee, Frank J. Canfield, has disappeared, along with a large sum of money. He refuses to print the story on the front page of the newspaper, because there is no proof that Canfield, an honest and prominent lawyer, fled with the missing funds. When every other newspaper in the city features the story, the newspapers owner, Graham (Berton Churchill), reprimands Brad for the missing story and fires him. Brad says that his contract does not allow him to be fired, so Graham decides to make him write the lonely hearts column. Brad is furious, but has no choice but to accept the position. He also decides to keep an eye on the Frank J. Canfield story. The current writer of the column, Gerry (Glenda Farrell), who herself was demoted to the position by Brad, is delighted by the news. When Gerry accuses him of having no guts because he cannot handle the job, Brad puts his skills to work, and the column becomes very popular. One day, Rosa Marinello comes to the newspapers office, looking for Nellie Nelson, Brads pseudonym for the column. She ask Nellie to intervene on her behalf, because her undertaker father no longer wants her to marry her fianc√©. When Brad learns that Canfield was last seen at the same address where Rosa lives, he agrees to go. Brad finds out that gangster Brownell (Robert Barrat) attended a funeral around the time of Canfields disappearance. Brad later discovers that Canfield was framed and murdered by his rival. Brad advises Brownell to dig up Canfields body and transfer it to another grave, and gets a photograph of the body and takes it to his newspaper. Brownell is arrested and tried for murder. Canfield is cleared, and Brad is reinstated as the newspapers editor.
