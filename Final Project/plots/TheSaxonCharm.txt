In a hospital, theatrical producer Matt Saxon is introduced to writer Eric Busch, and ends up offering to produce Erics new play with financing from millionaire Zack Humber. Alma Wragg, a singer, is Saxons girlfriend, but she warns Erics wife Janet about the producers notorious "Saxon charm" that coaxes others into doing his bidding, only to end up badly for everyone involved. Sure enough, Saxons behavior soon ruins Almas nightclub audition. It isnt long before Saxon makes a pest of himself, interrupting a beach vacation Eric and Janet take, closing the show after a poor review, then persuading Eric to go off by himself to do rewrites. Saxon loses the financial backing of Humber so he works on his ex-wife to put up the money, not knowing she is broke. Alma gets a chance to be in a Hollywood movie, but Saxon interferes with that as well. Janet, upset by Erics absences, begins drinking and threatens to leave him. Eric finally punches Saxon, who is so oblivious to his destructive nature, he even contributes to his ex-wifes suicide. Eric and Janet get away from him just in time.
