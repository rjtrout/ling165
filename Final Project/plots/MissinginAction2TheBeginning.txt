Ten years before freeing the US POWs from a brutal General, Colonel James Braddock (Chuck Norris) was held in a North Vietnamese POW camp run by sadistic Colonel Yin (Soon-Teck Oh), who forces the POWs to grow opium for a French drug runner named François (Pierre Issot), and tries to get Braddock to admit to and sign a long list of war crimes. During his teams time in captivity, they are relentlessly subjected to various forms of humiliating torture, and Braddock being told that his wife has left him and has remarried. Frankie, another US POW, starts to suffer from malaria, and Braddock exchanges an admission of guilt to Yins charges of war crimes for medicine for the infected soldier. However, breaking his deal with Braddock, Yin gives the soldier a lethal dose of opium instead. Enraged, Braddock escapes from the camp, and plots to free his fellow prisoners and destroy the prison camp. Yin then betrays François, taking control of his drug ring. Braddock inflicts several losses against Yins men, leading to Yins second-in-command to dress a Vietnamese soldier as Colonel Yin and shoot him in an attempt to lure Braddock into the open. Braddock however notices that the decoy is not wearing Yins boots, and proceeds to kill Yins men. Eventually, Braddock fights Yin hand to hand in Yins quarters. Subduing Yin, Braddock escorts the prisoners to an awaiting helicopter although not before igniting explosive charges planted around Yins quarters.
