Teddy Taylor is the leader of Ted Taylors Collegians. One night, his usual singer cant sing. He decides to try out singing. However, his voice cant be heard over the band. A dancer stops and jokes with him by handing him a megaphone. Taylor sings through it, and he is heard. The ladies are enamored with his soft voice while the men are disgusted. Taylor becomes a big star over night, but his ego becomes inflated. Things come to a head when Taylor loses his temper and punches a heckler in the audience, who he didnt realize was a cripple. Shunned, he loses his girlfriend, his band, his fame, and his dignity. In the final scene, as a drunk and unhappy Peter Sturgis, who promoted Teddy Taylor into a singing star and gave up his fiancee Judy Mason to him, continues to drink heavily in a speakeasy, an announcer on the speakeasys radio proclaims, "â€¦And now, it is our great privilege to bring to you the new sensation of the air, Bang Busby, who will croon for you in his inimitable manner, Sweethearts Forever". As the song, which had already been sung a number of times by Teddy Taylor, begins to be heard, Sturgis grabs a bottle and hurls it at the radio, breaking it.
