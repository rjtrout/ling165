Gordon Shaw was a flyer who was shot down and killed during World War I. Nina (Norma Shearer) would have married him before he left, but her father forbade the marriage. Charlie (Ralph Morgan) is a friend, but Nina does not love him; and he is too timid, too shy, to tell her the way he feels about her. Sam (Alexander Kirkland) is her husband, but her love for him disappears after the ceremony, when she finds out that there is mental illness in his family and that there can be no children. To have the child she wants, but cannot have with Sam, she has a secret affair with Ned (Clark Gable), who wants her to leave Sam. Gordon Evans (Robert Young) is the result of the affair, but he does not know Ned is his real father. Nina continues to play with the emotions of all three men and devote herself only to Gordon.
