Thomas "Tom" tries to capture a sleeping Cuckoo, but Gerald "Jerry" trips him up and the cage rolls into a tree, waking Cuckoo up. As Tom pursues Jerry, Cuckoo saves Jerry by tugging a drying line, which tangles Tom. Tom then chases Cuckoo with an axe, but misses and cut into pieces down a tree, which frequently bounces off Toms head, propelling him. Cuckoo motions for Jerry to join him in his birdhouse; Tom comes behind, but Cuckoo gives him with a 2,000 lb weight to push him diving. As Jerry and Cuckoo shake hands, Tom uses a ladder to climb up again but Cuckoo sets the ladder on fire to send Tom falling again. Tom uses a swing, but Jerry and Cuckoo leap onto his hands. Tom then tries to pole vault to the birdhouse, but Cuckoo uses a roller skate to project Tom smash into a nearby house, where he is hung up by a girdle. However, Tom then realizes he can use the girdle to fly, much to his delight, and decides to use it to get on an equal playing field against Jerry and Cuckoo. After crashing into a mailbox, Tom learns to travel through the air, jumping off a house roof and flying around the birdhouse, much to Jerrys shock. Jerry wakes up Cuckoo, who declines to believe Jerry, but is also shocked to see Tom flying. Tom flies after Cuckoo, but they both hit a church bell. Cuckoo and Jerry then turn the roof of the birdhouse upside down, causing Tom to fly into nails and fall into a pond. Jerry goes to leave the birdhouse, however, Tom catches him. Seeing this, Cuckoo unties Toms wings and grabs Jerry, sending Tom falling through a tree. Cuckoo carries Jerry away as Tom chases them in hot pursuit, but a train suddenly comes out of a train tunnel and slams Tom onto a grade crossing signal. Tom becomes a wigwag for the train to allow it to pass through, where, on board, Jerry and Cuckoo shake hands again.
