Frustrated singers Hannah Holbrook, Joyce Campbell and S. F. "Foxy" Rogers return dejectedly to New York on a bus, their out-of-town engagement in Vermont, arranged by small-time promoter Lew Conway, having been a huge flop. Nancy Peterson, another passenger on the bus, mistakenly believes Dan Carter has stolen her suitcase. It turns out both are entertainers. They end up with each others bags, then become better acquainted after the mix-up. The conniving Lew represents Dan and tries to get him to take the same bad gig the girl singers just left. Lew also meets a couple of delicatessen owners, Leo and Harry, who might have money to invest in his performers careers. The agent has an impersonator, Glendon, pretend to be the producer of bandleader Bob Crosbys television program. Everybody excitedly believes that Lew has booked them on the TV show. Lew continually tries to get in to see Crosbys actual producer, totally in vain. He lies to the singers that Crosby wont book them because he is jealous of Dans ability as a singer. A furious Nancy barges into the TV studio to berate Crosby and his producer, who have no idea what she is talking about. Nancy boards a bus, headed back home. Crosbys producer, however, says hes been interested in Dan for quite a while, and ends up with an opening on tonights show after Lew locks the scheduled performers in a closet. Nancy refuses to believe Lew that the gang really is performing on tonights show, until she spots Dan singing on a TV in a stores window. She races back to New York just in time to join the others on the show.
