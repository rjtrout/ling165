Jeremiah "Jerry" Lane (Bert Wheeler) and Pierre Potkin (Robert Woolsey) are a couple of midway "pilots" on a carnival ride who have never actually been in the air. The duo leave their job when they are hired by smuggler Dave Hanlon (Jack Carson) to fly a real aircraft in order to retrieve a lifesaver. They believe that the lifesaver only consists of harmless photos, but soon find inside the lifesaver stolen jewels and cocaine. Jerry and Pierre eventually land in the backyard of the Arlington estate, owened by Arlene (Marjorie Lord), Martha (Margaret Dumont) and Horace Arlington (Paul Harvey). Initially, the Arlingtons believe that the duo are police officers, and readily allow them to stay in their home. As it turns out, the Arlingtons are good friends with Hanlon. When Hanlon is informed that Jerry and Pierre are at the Arlington estate, he convinces the family that the two men are lunatics from an asylum. Hanlon and some of his cronies (posing as doctors) show up at the mansion in order to "bump off" Jerry and Pierre, and get the smuggled jewels. However, the jewels have been hidden by the Arlingtons kleptomaniac dog. A frantic and confusing search around the manor soon occurs, with dozens of cops added into the mix.
