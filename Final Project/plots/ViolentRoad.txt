After an out-of-control rocket causes death and destruction, trucker Mitch Barton and several other men volunteer for a nearly suicidal mission to deliver rocket fuel--hydrazine, nitric acid, and concentrated hydrogen peroxide--safely over a rough mountain road within three days. Fuel developer George Lawrence hires the man and comes along. The men take the dangerous job for an exorbitant fee and discuss what they will do with the money. When his brother Ben is too drunk to drive, race car driver Ken takes his place. Frank Miller, determined to provide for his nagging wife, sacrifices himself for the good of the others, plugging a chemical leak with his hand and exposing himself to it fatally. Detoured by breakdowns, fatigue and a treacherous terrain, plus a runaway school bus, Mitch and the men arrive at their destination and receive their pay.
