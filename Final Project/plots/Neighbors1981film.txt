Earl Keese is a low-key, ineffectual, middle-class suburbanite with a wife, Enid, and a teenage daughter, Elaine. Earls peaceful, dreary life changes when a younger couple, Vic and Ramona, move in next door. Upon arrival, the new neighbors immediately impose themselves on the Keese household, leaving Earl infuriated with the loud, gung-ho Vic, and flustered by the sly and seductive Ramona. Earl is frustrated by his inability to handle them, and the fact that he can never come up with any proof that the couple are doing anything wrong on purpose. Enid and Elaine are no help, and over the course of one night, the antagonism between Earl and his new neighbors escalates into suburban warfare. Earl begins to question his sanity, and the sanity of his wife and daughter. He realizes that his new neighbors have provided him with the most excitement hes had in years, and that they can give him a promising future apart from suburbia and away from his family. In the films closing scene, Earl joins Vic and Ramona, leaving his family behind and his house on fire.
