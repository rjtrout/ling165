Margie Moore (Havoc), a down-on-her-luck San Francisco woman, turns in desperation to jewel robbery. She barely escapes getting nabbed in a heist and moves to Los Angeles where she gets an honest job as a waitress. Her troubles start again, however, when she falls madly in love with smooth-talking Mitch Foster (Romero). Mitch reveals his true colors by stealing every penny she has, then turning her into the authorities. In prison with her partner-in-crime Pearl, she is visited by Mitch and waitress friend Flo (McDonald), and the attempts by Mitch to con her out of money continue. Margie overpowers a doctor and slips away from prison disguised as one. Law enforcement authorities look for her at Mitchs and discover his illegal activities there. Mitch tries to get away, but Margie lures him to a deserted spot, then shoots him.
