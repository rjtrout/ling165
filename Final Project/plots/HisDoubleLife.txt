Priam Farrel (Roland Young) is Englands most famous living painter. A recluse who hates fame, he has not been seen by anyone for years, not even his agent or cousin. He is glad to be mistaken for his valet by everyone, including his cousin, when he returns to England. He is happy to live a quiet country life with his manservants mail order bride (Lillian Gish) ... until he gets hauled into court for bigamy and fraud.
