Advertising jingle writer Jane Morgan (Dorothy McGuire) is treated for a cold by a doctor, Bill Wright (William Lundigan), and soon they date and fall in love. Jane is warned by Bills mother (Jessie Royce Landis) and by another doctors wife, Maggie (June Havoc), about the complications of being married to someone in that profession, work always taking priority over his personal life. Jane gives birth to twins, but her gradual frustration over Bills absences are further irritated by his intended collaboration with physician Helen Porter (Joyce MacKenzie), who is very attractive and makes Jane jealous. When she pretends to be ill simply to coax Bill into coming home, Jane is annoyed when Helen turns up to treat her instead, causing friction between the two women. Just as she is preparing to leave her husband, Janes children are accidentally poisoned. Bill is able to save them. A grateful Jane also learns that Mrs. Wright has persuaded Helen to take a job in another city.
