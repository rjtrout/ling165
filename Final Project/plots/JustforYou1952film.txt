Widower Jordan Blake (Bing Crosby) is a successful Broadway producer and songwriter, but he has been neglecting his teenaged children, Jerry (Robert Arthur) and Barbara (Natalie Wood). In rehearsal with star and girlfriend Carolina Hill (Jane Wyman), he keeps Jerry waiting, then dismisses a song his son has written as trite. Jordan is also unaware that Jerry is hopelessly in love with Carolina, who has wedding plans of her own...but to Jordan. Then when daughter Barbara ends up in night court with her governess, who has been arrested for a drunken disagreement with a police officer, Jordan realizes he needs to spend more time with his kids. At the urging of Carolina, he takes both to a resort, not far from a finishing school that Barbara would love to attend. Without realizing that Alida De Bronkhart (Ethel Barrymore) is the headmistress there, Jordan tries to learn from Alida the best way to get a girl accepted at the exclusive school. He also performs an old vaudeville song for the trustees, causing his daughter great embarrassment. Carolina has a heart-to-heart talk with young Jerry about being in love. He mistakenly believes Carolina means him when she mentions her intention to marry. Jerry is crushed when he learns on the radio that Carolina is engaged to his father. Heartbroken, he enlists in the Air Force and leaves home. Time goes by. In wartime, Jordan does his part by performing on a USO tour of Alaska. He speaks from the heart about the highs and lows of raising children, unaware that his son is in the audience. They, along with Carolina, are eventually reunited.
