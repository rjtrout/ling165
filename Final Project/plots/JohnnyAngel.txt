A merchant ship captain (George Raft) finds his fathers ship – of the same line – derelict at sea, the entire crew having disappeared. From an unlisted passenger (Signe Hasso), the only survivor of the hijacking of the ship, he learns of a plot involving secret gold, and searches New Orleans for his fathers murderer.
