Lord Rexford (Herbert Marshall) leaves his American wife, Mary (Norma Shearer) at home while he travels on business to America. During his absence, Mary travels to the Riviera to visit Lord Rexfords aunt. There she runs into an old flame, Tommie (Robert Montgomery)—a good-time, heavy-drinking sort—and he ardently pursues her, eventually drawing her into a compromising situation that causes scandalous press coverage. Upon his return, Lord Rexford is furious. His inability to believe Marys explanation, as well as the continued presence of Tommie, quickly drives a wedge between husband and wife. Rexford becomes cool towards Mary at home and avoids her, even waiting until she has left the nursery before entering to say goodnight to their young daughter. Seeking to escape the tension at home, Mary eventually goes out with friends, and Rexford uses the occasion to ask her for a divorce. When she tries again to explain, he tells her that her behavior no longer matters. After learning from a friend that Mary was largely blameless in the incident, Rexford changes his mind and sends a telegram begging her forgiveness, not knowing that his abandonment of Mary has at last driven her into the arms of Tommie. She tries to conceal this belated infidelity as they reconcile, but soon admits the truth when Tommie asserts that he has a claim on her. Rexford is furious again; this time she asks for the divorce. Mary plans to return to New York, refusing any settlement and sadly renouncing custody of her daughter and all claims. While approving the final agreement, she refuses to say goodbye to her daughter, as a last meeting would be unbearable to her. As she leaves, Lord Rexford asks her to return to him, and as they happily reconcile, their little girl bursts into the room and embraces her parents.
