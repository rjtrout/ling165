Scotty McKay (Cameron) is just an everyday beach-bum who used to have it all, when he finds an attractive genie named Jeannie (Dolenz). Her mission is to assist Scotty. With Jeannies help, Scotty has everything again and more, as Jeannie does his bidding and answers to his every beck and call; that is until he asks Jeannie to make him more desirable to the next door supermodel, Dana (Felicity Waterman). Jeannie cant help as far as love is concerned, and besides, Dana is just not interested. Jeannie soon runs into problems when she finds herself attracted to Scotty and finds it difficult to help him win Danas heart. The story ensues with a gamut of events resulting in mayhem.
