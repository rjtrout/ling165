Wanted on a charge of murder, Brett Matton (Guy Madison), a war veteran, has fled the country to Spain, where he has been living for two years and is engaged to wed Jean Gurney (Virginia Mayo), a former showgirl. FBI Agent Stafford (George Raft) arrives in Spain to arrest Brett and bring him back to the U.S. On their commercial flight to New York, the passengers include Jean, who bought a ticket at the last minute, and Lord Leverett (George Macready), a man deranged by his daughters death. Leverett brings aboard a chemical poison hidden in his bag. The handcuffed Brett is given a few minutes by Stafford to explain to Jean about his past life. His story is that two men killed a bartender, knocked him out and placed the gun in his hand. Certain he would never get a fair trial, Brett ran away. A minister on board marries Brett to Jean with the agents permission. Brett steals a pistol from a partner of Staffords who is asleep. He tells Jean,to avoid going to jail, he intends to hijack the airliner to Canada, landing in Montreal, at an airport he knows. The poison leaks from Leveretts case, emitting toxic fumes, and causing a fire in the cabin, killing the pilots and navigator. Former combat pilot Brett is asked to fly the aircraft. He must make an emergency landing on water and without a radio, which Leverett has damaged. Brett ends up shooting Leverett, although a grateful Stafford still insists on being given the gun. Brett takes pity on the dying passengers and lands the jet. Authorities on the ground inform Stafford that another man is being charged with the bar murder and Brett will be cleared.
