Manhattan food writer Rachel Samstat and Washington, D.C. political columnist Mark Forman meet at a mutual friends wedding. Both have been married before and Mark has a reputation for being a serial womanizer. After a whirlwind courtship, the two marry, despite Rachels reservations. They purchase a dilapidated Georgetown townhouse and Rachel struggles to adapt to being a wife in Washingtons political high society. The ongoing renovations of their house create some stress in Mark and Rachels marriage, but they are brought closer together when Rachel discovers she is pregnant. Rachel experiences a difficult labor in which the babys life is briefly threatened, but she gives birth to a healthy baby girl named Annie. Soon after, Rachel discovers evidence of Marks extramarital affair with socialite Thelma Rice during her pregnancy with her second child. She leaves him and takes their daughter to New York, where she moves in with her father and gets her job back as a food writer. Although she insists that she has left him for good, Rachel is dismayed when he fails to call her after several days. She inadvertently leads a burglar to a group therapy session she is attending in her therapists apartment; he robs the group and takes Rachels wedding ring. Just after, Mark arrives and asks her to come back, insisting he will never see Thelma again. Rachel gives birth to their second child, but struggles to fully forgive Mark. She spreads a nasty rumor about Thelma having Chlamydia but is caught out by Mark. The New York police return Rachels wedding ring after they catch the burglar. When she takes it to the jewelers to get the stone tightened, she discovers that Mark has bought a very expensive necklace, which coincides with Thelmas birthday. Realizing that he has returned to the affair, Rachel sells her wedding ring and leaves with both her children for New York, this time for good.
