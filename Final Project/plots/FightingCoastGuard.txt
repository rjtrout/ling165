Shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, shipyard foreman Bill Rourk is feuding with a former football star, Barney Walker, who now works there. He is romantically attracted to Louise Ryan, an admirals daughter working as a wartime welder, but she is dating Ian McFarland, a naval commander. McFarland launches an officers training course once America becomes active in the war. Bill signs up, but his record is tainted by lies told by Walker and by being caught out after curfew by the military police while trying to romance Louise. Walker is fatally injured in battle and confesses his lies about Bill before dying. When a former shipyard colleague, young Tony Jessup, is stranded and endangered, Bill disobeys orders and heroically tries to save Tony, who dies while being rescued. McFarland commends his bravery, then confides to that his sweetheart, Louise, has fallen in love with Bill.
