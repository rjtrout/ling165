Patrick Dennis (Jan Handzlik), orphaned in 1928 when his father unexpectedly dies, is placed in the care of Mame Dennis (Rosalind Russell), his fathers sister in Manhattan. Mame is a flamboyant, exuberant woman, who hosts frequent parties with eclectic, bohemian guests. Patrick is quickly introduced to his aunts free-spirited and eccentric lifestyle, including Vera Charles (Coral Browne), a Broadway actress, who spends many of her nights passed out drunk in Mames guest room, and Lindsay Woolsey (Patric Knowles), a book publisher. Mames frequently repeated motto is "Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!" Since Patricks father was a wealthy man at the time of his death, Patricks inheritance comes with a trustee, Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark), who disapproves of Mames lifestyle (as did her brother, Edwin) and wants to interject discipline in Patricks life. Mame has Patrick enrolled at a progressive school run by a friend of hers, Acacius Page (Henry Brandon). Mr. Babcock insists that Patrick be enrolled at Bixbys, a nearby boys prep school. When he learns that Mame has not enrolled Patrick at Bixbys, he orders that Patrick go to St. Boniface boarding school and Mame will only see him at the holidays and during the summer. When Mames investments are lost in the stock market crash of 1929, she takes a series of jobs—stage acting, telephone operator, sales girl at Macys—that all end disastrously. At her sales job at Macys, she meets a man named Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Forrest Tucker), a rich oil man from the South. Hes immediately smitten with her, and she falls in love with him as well. He proposes to her at his estate in Georgia. For their honeymoon, they travel around the world. Through Mames correspondence with Patrick, she senses that the now-grown Patrick (Roger Smith) is growing into a conventional man. After Beau dies while they are climbing the Matterhorn, Mame comes home. Patrick surprises her by installing a dictating machine and a secretary, Agnes Gooch (Peggy Cass). He and her friends persuade her to write her autobiography. Patrick and Lindsay arrange for a collaborator (and ghost writer) for Mame, Brian OBannion (Robin Hughes). He is initially charming, but it soon becomes clear that OBannion is a hack and is using Mame as a meal ticket. Patrick announces that he has a girlfriend, Gloria Upson (Joanna Barnes), and wants to bring her over to meet Mame, but he cautions Mame to act responsibly while Gloria is there. She calls him beastly and he almost leaves, but at the last minute Mame says she will do whatever he wants to make him and Gloria happy. Patrick leaves to bring Gloria. Meanwhile, OBannion insists Mame accompany him to a party to meet movie producers interested in Mames autobiography. Mame instead dresses up the dowdy Agnes and tells OBannion that Agnes is an heiress merely doing secretarial work for "literary experience". OBannions greed kicks in, and he escorts Agnes to the party in Mames place. When Agnes returns the next day, she is disheveled and remembers very little of her night with OBannion—only that she drank heavily and thinks she saw a movie with a wedding scene in it. Patrick brings Gloria over, but Mame is horrified to see she is nothing more than a spoiled rich girl. Against Patricks wishes, she goes to visit Glorias family in a "restricted" community in Connecticut, where they express anti-Semitic views. Her parents (Lee Patrick and Willard Waterman), although outwardly friendly, are just like Gloria. Mame arranges a dinner party at her apartment and she invites Gloria, her parents, and a few of her own friends. On the night of the party, Patrick meets Pegeen (Pippa Scott), Mames new secretary; Agnes is now several months pregnant due to her night with OBannion. Everything about the evening is a carefully planned disaster: the food, the drink, the furniture, and the company. Lindsay surprises the attendees with the galleys from Mames autobiography. The ribald content leads Gloria to insult the other attendees. Patrick defends them, attacking Glorias friends instead. The release of the book prompts a telegram from OBannion demanding his collaborative efforts be rewarded and declaring that his wife Agnes can substantiate his claims. The Upsons and Mr. Babcock leave in a huff. Several years later, when Patrick and Pegeen are married, their son, Michael, wants to travel with Mame on her trip to India. The two of them wear down Patrick and Pegeens objections, and the movie fades away as Mame tells Michael of all the wondrous sights they will see.
