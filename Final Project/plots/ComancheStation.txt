Jefferson Cody (Randolph Scott), whose wife was captured by Comanches, frees another mans wife and is taking her home. Three outlaws, led by the charming but malevolent Ben Lane (Claude Akins), reveal that the womans husband has offered a $5,000 reward, making the woman, Lordsburg resident Mrs. Lowe (Nancy Gates), suspicious of Codys motives in coming to her rescue. Lane is known to Cody, who helped court-martial him from the army for killing "tame" Indians. The Comanche in the area, on the warpath due to recent Comanche scalpings, kill Frank (Skip Homeier), one of Lanes men, and make repeated attempts to kill the rest of the party. Lane attaches himself to Cody, intending to make it look like the Comanches killed Cody and to take the reward for himself. Although her husband did not try to find her himself, the reward for the return of Mrs. Lowe is "dead or alive," so Lane prefers dead so she wont be able to testify against him. He tries to ambush her and Cody, and when partner Dobie (Richard Rust) refuses to help, Lane shoots him. In a showdown in the hills, Cody gets the better of Lane. He escorts the woman back home, discovering that her husband is blind. Before he can be paid the $5,000, Cody rides away.
