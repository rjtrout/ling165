The movie follows a mans search for perfection in a world where life rarely measures up to the idealized images that constantly bombard us. Gary Shaller (Freeman), who gained commercial success in previous years as the keyboard player in the fictional band "On The One". He is in a failing marriage with Dora (Gwyneth Paltrow), and working for his former band mate Paul (Simon Pegg), writing and recording commercial jingles. Gary eventually discovers that he is having lucid dreams about a glamorous woman named Anna (Pen√©lope Cruz), with whom he is deeply infatuated. He aims to learn more about lucid dreaming by buying books and even attending classes taught by an eccentric lucid-dreaming enthusiast, Mel (Danny DeVito). Gary eventually discovers that the girl he dreams about does, in fact, exist. Paul arranges for Gary to meet her, but this proves disappointing, as she fails to live up to the expectations that Gary has built up in his dreams of her. He eventually continues to dream about her, and even soundproofs his apartment, and makes other efforts to be able to sleep longer, so that he can remain with Anna for longer periods of time. Eventually, feeling as though he is betraying Dora, he attempts to go back to her.
