Cappy Ricks (Walter Brennan) has returned home from a long voyage at sea only to find that his family and business are not as he left them. His daughter Frankie (Mary Brian) is engaged to a dimwit that he isnt fond of. His future mother-in-law owns already 51% of his business and has plans even for his prized ship. Cappy Ricks knows he has to end the chaos and set things straight. He brings them all on his ship, as there he can be still the Captain. And as in other movies of that period he needs an uninhabited Island to straighten out the arrogance of the rich ladies and the weakness of sons under mothers dominance.
