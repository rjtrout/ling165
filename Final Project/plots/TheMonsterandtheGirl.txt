A gangster named Scot Webster (Philip Terry) attempts to save his sister, Susan (Ellen Drew) from the clutches of rival gangster W. S. Bruhl (Paul Lukas). When one of Bruhls gang members catches Scot in Bruhls rented room, one of Scots aides is killed by a gunman. The man tosses him the gun and disappears. Scot is tried and executed. A scientist (George Zucco) salvages his brain and transplants it into a gorilla. Using the strength of his new, bestial body, Webster begins stalking the gangsters to exact his revenge.
