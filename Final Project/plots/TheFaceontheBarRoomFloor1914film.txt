A painter turned tramp (Charlie Chaplin), devastated by losing the woman he was courting as a wealthy man, finds himself drunk and getting drunker by the minute with some sailors at a bar until he collapses. He keeps futilely trying to draw the womans picture on the floor with a piece of chalk until he finally passes out cold (or perhaps dies, as in the poem) at the end of the film. According to Chaplin expert Gerald D. McDonald, "The subtitles of the film were lines from the poem, but the original verses were altered to match the Keystone credo that life is a funny game at best."
