Little Iodine (Marlowe) stays true to her comic strip nature in this film, where she does her best to break up the marriage of her parents (Cavanaugh and Ryan), ruin a romance between Janis and Marc (Whitney and Cramer), and cost her father his job. Unlike her comic-based character, however, Iodine has a change of heart and sets out to right the wrongs.
