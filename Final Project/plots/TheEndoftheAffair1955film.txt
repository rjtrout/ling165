The writer Maurice Bendrix (Van Johnson) recalls his time in London toward the end of World War II, and following its conclusion, when he meets at a sherry party Sarah Miles (Deborah Kerr), the wife of his London acquaintance Henry Miles (Peter Cushing). They become lovers. During their affair his rooms on the square are bombed, she quits their relationship and he suffers from the loss and delayed shock from the bombing. It is after their break-up and the end of the war that Bendrix encounters Henry on the square, who invites him for a drink at his home especially as Sarah will not be there. He admits that he suspects the infidelity of his wife, has looked into a private investigator and approaches Bendrix to act on his behalfâ€”but retracts the idea. Sarah returns home before Bendrix has left and she is curt in her exchange with him. Bendrix follows through with hiring a private detective agency. They come across information that the portrayal of Bendrixs housing situation being bombed did not disclose some facts about what happened to Bendrix and Sarahs wish that he be alive. Sarah had to resolve her infidelity with Bendrix, her prayer for Bendrix to be alive, her relationship with God and her marriage during discussions, sometimes extended, she had at all times of the day with a priest.
