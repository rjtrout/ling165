In 1970s New York City, David Marks (Gosling), the son of a powerful real estate tycoon, marries Katie McCarthy (Dunst), a beautiful working-class student. Together they flee New York for country life in Vermontâ€”only to be lured back by Davids father (Frank Langella). Upon their return, they buy a beautiful apartment. When Katie brings up the idea of having children, David implies he cant have any. They eventually buy a lake house out of town, and Katie tells a pregnant neighbor that she is expecting as well. Katie tells David, to which he responds by throwing a chair and breaking a shelf. David makes Katie have an abortion, which he misses while doing work for his father. Katie goes back to college and eventually applies and gets into medical school. During a celebratory party at her parents house, David drags Katie out by her hair when he wants to go home and she asks him to wait. Katie wants a separation, but her funds, which she needs in order to graduate, are cut off when she attempts to leave. David gets violent and Katie begins to show signs of abuse. Family secrets are slowly revealed, and Katie disappears without a trace. Years later, the 20-year-old case is re-opened. Soon after this, Davids best friend Deborah Lehrman (Lily Rabe) is found dead, and police consider David as the main suspect.
