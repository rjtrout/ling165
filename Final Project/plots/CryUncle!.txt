The story follows a detective who takes on a murder case, complicated by a diverse group of suspects and a lot of sexual situations. A private eye named Jake Masters is hired by eccentric millionaire Jason Dominic to clear up a phony murder rap. The NYPD is hunting for Dominic, in connection with the brutal murder of a cocktail waitress named Lucille Reynolds, and Dominic wants Masters to find the real killer. Masters is sent to La Guardia Airport to pick up Cora Merrillâ€”Dominics trigger-happy troubleshooter. After an initial case of mistaken identity, Jake, his trainee nephew Keith and Miss Merrill head out to Dominics palatial (but shabby) yacht. Dominic tells them the police believe he killed Lucille because she had filmed an orgy featuring him with three drug-addicted whores, who then blackmailed him out of $50,000. In search of suspects, Jake gets involved with a group of hookers including a bizarre act of necrophilia. Jake eventually stumbles onto the revelation that Cora Merrill has been leading him on and actually working for Jason Dominic to knock off the blackmailers after Jake has located them for her.
