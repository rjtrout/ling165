Ernest (Jim Varney) takes a job with a cleaning service at the local mall, and he soon seeks to join his co-workers basketball team, "Clean Sweep", as they compete in the city league tournament. He is reluctantly accepted by the team, but given only a minor role as their cheerleader and mascot. In his despair, he is visited by an angel (played by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), and given a pair of magical shoes, but is warned, "Dont misuse the shoes." As a matter of fact, the shoe stores owner, Zamiel Moloch happens to be a demon in disguise. He would eventually prevent Ernests sportsmanship with the basketball players by luring Ernest to arrogance. When an injury to a key player leaves the team desperate for a replacement, Ernest is given an opportunity to play. In the process, he discovers that the supernatural shoes have imbued him with super speed and the ability to fly. Armed with these extraordinary abilities, he leads the team to a series of victories leading ultimately to a showdown with the NBAs Charlotte Hornets. As the city league tournament champions, Clean Sweep earns the right to play an exhibition contest against the Hornets, but suffers turmoil as Ernests teammates soon grow weary of his ball-hogging antics. While Ernest is in the zone and the team does nothing but sit around, Ernest decides to let the team do the work and get rid of the shoes, but Ernest is needed again and scores (along with causing some mishaps) the game-winning point and the members of the team get drafted into the NBA.
