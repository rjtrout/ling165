Simon Dayton is in fear for his life and seeks the help of Mr. Wong to protect him. Just prior to meeting Mr. Wong, Dayton is found dead in his office without a mark on him with several witnesses testifying Dayton was alone in his office that was locked from the inside. Though the police view Daytons death as due to a heart attack, Mr. Wong discovers a broken glass ball that contained poison gas. Among the suspects are agents of a foreign power wishing to stop Daytons chemicals being sent to use on the foreign power in the form of the same poison gas that killed Dayton, Daytons business partners who will have Daytons share of the business come to them after Daytons death and the actual inventor of the chemical who has been cheated out of profits and recognition by Dayton.
