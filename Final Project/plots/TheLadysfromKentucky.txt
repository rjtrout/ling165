A gambler, Marty Black, wins a fifty percent interest in a thoroughbred owned by Penelope "Penny" Hollis, a prim and proper Kentucky horsewoman. Marty cant wait to wager on his new possession, Roman Son, but the health of the horse is foremost to Penny, who would rather nurture it than race it. After he enters Roman Son in a race without her knowledge, Marty sees the horses condition deteriorate. Penny permits him to run Roman Son in the Kentucky Derby and a romance develops after the horses victory, particularly when Marty agrees to retire Roman Son rather than race any more.
