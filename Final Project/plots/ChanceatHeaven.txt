An ambitious mechanic is tempted to desert his wonderful girlfriend when a silly but rich debutante falls for him. Marje is in love with Blackie, the owner of a local garage. Blackie says he loves Marje, but Marje knows that Blackie is truly in love with Glory. Marje tells Blackie to follow his heart and marry Glory. Much to the great dismay of her very wealthy mother, Glory and Blackie elope and settle into Blackies bungalow. The newlyweds are happy and an unlikely friendship develops between Glory and Marje. One day, Glory learns that she is pregnant. Seizing the opportunity, Glorys mother spirits her off to New York so that she can be better cared for while in her delicate condition. The visit to New York turns from weeks into months. Finally, Blackie can wait no longer to see his wife when he learns from Marje that Glory isnt coming home, but is instead going to Los Angeles. Blackie arrives at the nearly empty New York apartment just as Glory and her mother are about to leave. Glorys mother tells Blackie that he shouldnt have come, explaining that Glory has changed. When Glory enters the room, she is distant. She tells Blackie that the marriage was a mistake and wants a divorce. When Blackie asks about the baby, Glory coldly states that the small town doctor was wrong and that she was never pregnant. A despondent Blackie returns home to his bungalow and finds that Marje is there and has made his favorite dinner. The two state their love for each other. It is implied that now Blackie can truly love Marje and that she will marry him.
