Janet feels that her parents dont love her anymore because they made her older sister the definite center of attention during her aunts visit. Filled with anger and despair, she decides to run away. The gang volunteers to help Janet become "adapted" by another couple and choose elderly Mr. and Mrs. Jones as potential candidates. One boy overhears their plans and immediately confronts Janets parents, who call the police. When the gang pay the Jones a visit and offer Janet to them, the Jones quickly realize that Janet is a runaway and decide to teach her and the gang a lesson. They agree to adopt her but make her life a living hell by forcing her to scrub the kitchen floor (which causes Janet to wail, "Why did I ever leave home?") and show where she will sleep (which is under the kitchen table). When Mrs. Jones decides that Janet is unhappy enough, she walks out of the kitchen to phone Janets parents, believing that Janet will happily run to them with open arms. But once Mrs. Jones leaves, Janet (with the help of the gang) runs away again. The gang soon discover that the police are searching for them, so they run and hide in a cave. While trying to cook some food, they burn it and create heavy smoke, which leaves their faces covered with soot and ashes. Once they see that the smoke will hide their true identities, they bring Janet back home and tell Janets parents why she wanted to run away. Janets family now realize how fortunate they are to have her. Mary apologizes for being neglectful and unfeeling towards her and assures that it will never happen again. With everything happy, Froggy says, "Alls well that ends well, I always say." Jasper corrects him, saying that the phrase was originally made by Shakespeare. "He did? Shucks!" answers a disappointed Froggy.
