Steve and Jeff are about to open a nightclub when a man named Martin Drew who represents conductor Ladislaus Cassel claims that Cassel, who is living next door, objects to the clubs music and that it disturbs his granddaughter, Victoria, an aspiring opera singer. It turns out that Cassel himself is fine with the club but Vickis grandmother Lucia is against it. Cassel also urges Vicki not to marry Andrew, her fiance, without being certain. After she meets Steve, she is attracted to him. Steve has a girlfriend, Elaine Winters, who is trying to persuade John Braden, a rich Texan, to finance the club. Elaine is upset about Vickis presence and threatens to marry Braden. Jeff and his girlfriend, singer Sue Jackson, hope to get a new show off the ground, but both Vickys grandmother and Steves girl Elaine keeps interfering. Cassel offers to finance the show provided Vicky can be in it. Lucia is livid until she reluctantly attends the show, at which she is charmed and gives her approval.
