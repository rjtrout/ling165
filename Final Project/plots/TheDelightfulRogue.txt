Lastro is a modern-day pirate who hijacks a yacht and heads into the tropic port of Tapit. He is wanted for a variety of offenses, including murder and robbery. Upon his arrival, he is recognized by a local native leader, Junipero, who recognizes him, but takes a bribe to not turn him in. While in Tapit, he sees an American dancer, Nydra, who he is immediately attracted to. Nydra is also being pursued by Harry Beall, the heir to a wealthy American family, yet Nydra is intrigued by Lastros self-assurance and audacity. Lastro is betrayed by Junipero, who brings the police to arrest Lastro. In the ensuing melee, Lastro overcomes both Junipero and the police, as well as easily brushing aside Beall. To secure his safe escape, Lastro takes Beall as a hostage back to his yacht. Nydra appears to beg Lastro to let Beall go, which Lastro agrees to, on one condition: Nydra must spend the night with Lastro in his cabin aboard the yacht. Nydra agrees. While they spend the night in the cabin, nothing untoward happens, with the two simply spending the time talking and getting to know each other. Nydra is impressed with Lastros gallantry. However, Beall has spent the night imagining the worst, and his jealous reactions in the morning completely turn Nydra off. Disgusted with his behavior, Nydra sets sails with the gallant pirate, Lastro.
