The story begins with an indifferent Mary Martin (Young) sitting in a courtroom, on trial for murder. As the jury leaves to deliberate her fate, the story flashbacks on Marys hard life as a woman living in a large city of the 1930s, as well as on the two lusty men—a gangster, Leo Darcy (Cortez), and a lawyer, Tom Mannering, Jr. (Tone)—with whom she is involved.
