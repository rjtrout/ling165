Relatives arrive for the reading of a will at a creepy mansion. Is someone is trying to murder Nina Arnold (Jeff Donnell) to claim a share of her grandmothers legacy, her grandmother who she never met? Could that someone be her emotionally unstable mother Rachel Martin (Karen Morley), from who she was taken when she was a baby? Investigators Jack Packard (Jim Bannon) and Doc Long (Barton Yarborough) are put on the case.
