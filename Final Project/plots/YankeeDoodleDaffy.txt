Porky Pig, a producer, loaded down with luggage and a golf bag, leaves his office in a hurry to board an airplane. Daffy Duck, a talent agent, prevents him from leaving and attempts to secure an audition for his client, a lethargic child performer named "Sleepy" Lagoon (a reference to the 1942 Sleepy Lagoon murder). The pitch, intended to demonstrate Sleepys allegedly wide and varied repertoire, consists of Daffy himself performing an array of musical and stage acts. Sleepy meanwhile stays seated, nonchalantly licking an enormous lollipop and silently commenting on Daffys ludicrous behavior using signs bearing rebuses. The songs that Daffy performs include Im Just Wild About Harry, William Tell Overture and Angel in Disguise (the same song that Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the Cat would sing in The Wabbit Who Came to Supper and Back Alley Oproar, respectively). Porky, with mounting frustration, repeatedly tries to escape from the pitch. Daffy handily foils each attempt in increasingly improbable ways, including by turning out to be the pilot of Porkys plane and then turning out to be the parachute Porky uses to escape said plane. Admitting defeat, Porky allows Sleepy to audition. Sleepy calmly leaves his seat and begins to sing in a strong, operatic baritone that is not only surprising given his small stature but also substantially more dramatic than any of the acts Daffy used in the pitch. However, during a high note near the end, he erupts into a long coughing fit before weakly croaking the rest of the line.
