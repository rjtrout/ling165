Vaudeville entertainer Eddie Foy (Bob Hope), who has vowed to forever keep his act a solo, falls in love with and marries Italian ballerina Madeleine (Milly Vitale). While they continue to tour the circuit, they begin a family and before long have seven children. After the tragedy of the Iroquois Theater Fire threatens to stall Eddies career, he comes to realize that his children are worth their weight in gold. The second eldest Foy, Charley, narrates the film. James Cagney reprises his role as George M. Cohan from the film Yankee Doodle Dandy for an energetic tabletop dance showdown sequence.
