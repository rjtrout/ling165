Leda Mueller seeks refuge in the United States, claiming to be the wife of Jerry Seabrook, a missing World War II combat pilot. A sympathetic colonel requires proof, whereupon a priest vouches for Ledas marriage and also tells the colonel she is expecting a baby. The colonel has knowledge that Jerry is alive, so Leda explains how they Jerry. A crash landing led to his taking refuge in an empty apartment that turned out to be hers. His co-pilot Biff is seriously injured, and by the time Leda can help find him, he is dead. Hans Welton, a German jealous over Ledas interest in the American pilot, takes up with her best friend Helena and recruits her to find out anything she can about Jerrys wartime activities. As intrigue builds, it turns out that Jerry is being court-martialed and charged with the murder of Hans. In a courtroom, the circumstances of the Germans death are explained, and Jerry then rushes to the side of Leda, who has given birth prematurely and near death.
