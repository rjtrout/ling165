Moe and Larry are at a sanatorium where Shemp is being treated for suffering from hallucinations. Before being prematurely released, Shemp insists on saying farewell to his new fianc√©e, beautiful nurse Nora (Babe London). When Nora calls out to Shemp, she appears, much to the scare of Moe and Larry: poor Nora is a homely, toothless thing who seems to have won Shemps heart. It then becomes clear that Shemp is far from cured, and needs additional therapy. While Shemp is home, the boys receive a visit from Dr. Gesundheit (Emil Sitka). The blind-as-a-bat doctor tries his best to cure Shemp, but runs into difficulty when the stubborn stooge refuses to swallow a sleeping pill. Later, Shemp hallucinates an extra set of hands while enduring his piano lesson. On the verge of a nervous breakdown, Shemp insists on seeing Nora, with hopes of finally getting married. On their way to the doctor, the Stooges become wedged in a phone booth with a stranger (Vernon Dent), leading to a fist and pie fight. Back in their apartment, they find she is waiting for her father who happens to be the man the Stooges brawled with in the phone booth.
