A retired secret service agent, Captain Matt Hunter (Dudikoff), takes on a sinister right-wing political organization called the Pentangle. He comes to the aid of his best friend Larry Richards (James), an African-American politician who has become a target for the Pentangles henchmen. Impressed by Hunters martial arts skills, the Pentangle leaders try to persuade him to join their cause and kidnap his sister Sarah (Gereighty) to make sure he cooperates. Hunter takes on the Pentangle one man at a time. The film concludes with the possibility of a sequel.
