Ace test pilot Bradley Farrell (Richard Arlen), flying for McMasters Aviation Corp., breaks his leg when an overweight prototype crashes. Brads younger brother Douglas (Don Castle), a recent graduate in aeronautical engineering thinks Dougs flying is too dangerous, and is hired as a design engineer at McMasters. Carol Blake (Jean Parker) wants to interest Brad in her fathers design for an aircraft made of plastic. Doug pretends to be Brad because he is attracted to her but Brad meets Carol and takes her out flying. She introduces him to her blind father, Professor Blake (Thomas W. Ross), resulting in Brad becoming immersed in the professors new designs. Brads friend, Johnny Coles (Louis Jean Heydt), loses his life test flying his own, similar design, that breaks apart in the air, leaving behind his wife and child. Despite his friends death, Brad convinces the company to build Blakes "geodetic" aircraft design, with his brother put in charge of the project. After Brad returns from setting a new cross-country speed record, he proposes to Carol, but she is in love with Doug. Doug doesnt know Carols true feelings and with the test of the professors aircraft imminent, he is at odds with Brad over the new aircrafts design. Brad has to fly the aircraft for US Army officials but is worried that the heavy test equipment will make the aircraft dangerous to fly. Doug will fly with him on the test and when a 9-G power dive is scheduled, Doug passes out. The test equipment breaks free, jamming the rudder. Brad forces Doug to parachute to safety, and then cuts the rudder wires, grabbing them with his bare hands. He manages to land the aircraft safely although his hands are cut badly. With the aircraft accepted, Brad gives up test flying to become a vice-president of McMasters Aviation. Doug and Carol find happiness and marry.
