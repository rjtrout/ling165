Danny ONeill (Fred Astaire), and Hank Taylor (Burgess Meredith) are friends and rival trumpeters with "ONeills Perennials," a college band. Both have managed to prolong their college careers by failing seven years in a row. At a performance, Ellen Miller (Paulette Goddard) catches Dannys and Hanks eyes. She serves them a notice for her boss, a debt collector, but the fast-talking ONeill and Taylor soon have her working as their manager. Tired of losing gigs to the Perennials, Artie Shaw, playing himself, comes to woo Ellen away to be his booking manager. She tries to get Danny and Hank an audition for Shaws band, but their jealous hi-jinks get them fired. Ellen talks Shaw into letting rich wannabee musician J. Lester Chisholm (Charles Butterworth) back a concert. It looks like the jig is up when Hank pretends to be Ellens jealous husband, and then her brother. Danny and Hank manage get Chisholm back on board, then get Shaw to agree to put Dannys song into the show. All they have to do is keep Chisholm and his mandolin, which he wants to play in the concert, away from Shaw until after the show; the solution is sleeping pills to knock Chisholm, and incidentally Hank, out. To Ellens relief, Danny finally acts professionally, arranging his number for the show, which Shaw says "has really grown up into something special." He hands the baton to Danny, who successfully dance-conducts his own composition.
