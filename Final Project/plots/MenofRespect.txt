Mike Battaglia, a powerful lieutenant in the Dâ€™Amico crime family, executes a large-scale hit on the familys enemies, earning a promotion to caporegime and the undying respect of his boss, Don Charlie DAmico. Despite the Dons generosity, however, Battaglia secretly resents DAmico for passing him over as his successor. At the instigation of Ruthie, his wife, Battaglia murders DAmico and has his sons shipped off to Florida, clearing the way for him to assume control of the DAmico family. He becomes an underworld despot, deciding to kill anyone he suspects as a threat to his power, including former ally Bankie Como and his unconnected son, Philly, who survives an assassination attempt. At his coronation as boss, a drunken Battaglia alienates two more of the mobs powerful soldiers. Afraid that Battaglias reign will spell the end of the DAmico family, several of Battaglias underlings desert him and ally themselves with DAmicos eldest son, Mal. Battaglia puts a hit out on his chief rival, Matt Duffy, but the assassins cannot find him, instead murdering his wife and son. Ruthie commits suicide out of guilt, which devastates Battaglia. Determined to get revenge for the death of his family, Duffy comes to kill Battaglia, who arrogantly proclaims that "no man of woman born" can harm him. Duffy responds that he was delivered via caesarian section, and therefore was not technically born of a woman. Disposing of Battaglia, he clears the way for Mal to assume control of the family.
