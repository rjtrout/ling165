Singles centers on the precarious romantic lives of a group of young Gen Xers in Seattle, Washington, at the height of the 1990s grunge phenomenon. Most of the characters dwell in an apartment block, a sign in front of which advertises "Singles" (single bedroom apartments) for rent. Divided into chapters, the film focuses on the course of two couples rocky romances, as well as the love lives of their friends and associates. The film revolves around Janet, a coffee-bar waitress fawning over Cliff, an aspiring, yet slightly aloof grunge rock musician of the fictional grunge/rock band Citizen Dick (which features members of the real-life grunge group Pearl Jam), Linda Powell and Steve Dunne, a couple wavering on whether to commit to each other, and Debbie Hunt, who is trying to find Mr. Right - a man who would make an ideal romantic partner - by making a video to express her desire. The events of the film are set against the backdrop of the early 1990s grunge movement in Seattle and features appearances from several musicians prominent in that movement. In the end (aside from some setbacks) Debbie meets her perfect significant other at an airport, Linda and Steve finally commit to each other (Steve leaves the apartment block to be with Linda), and Cliff realizes that Janet is the one for him after she finally gives up on their relationship.
