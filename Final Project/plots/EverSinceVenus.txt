A cosmetics manufacturer, J. Webster Hackett, hires Ina Ray Hutton and her band to headline a promotional beauty show. Hutton offers a thousand dollars reward for anyone who can submit a winning theme song. Not knowing of Huttons offer, a local short order cook, Tiny Lewis, who is also an aspiring songwriter, gets one of his songs to Hutton. Hutton lets him know that shell give him an answer within a day. When Lewis gets home, he finds out his roommates, Bradley Miller and Michele, have developed a new lipstick. A local beauty shop manager, Janet Wilson, thinks the product is a winner, as well as becoming enamored with Miller. She encourages them to enter the lipstick in a beauty products contest. Through a series and twists and turns, Lewis song is chosen, and he and his roommates use the $1000 reward from the song contest to pay the fee needed to showcase their lipstick at the beauty products show. A rival manufacturer to Hackett, P.G. Grimble, backs the product and agrees to produce the lipstick at his factories. As the deal is announced, Brad and Janet end up together.
