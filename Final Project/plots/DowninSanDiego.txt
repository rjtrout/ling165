Hank Parker is turned down by the U.S. Marine Corps for being too young, but his girlfriend Bettys older brother Al Haines is not. Al, however, is blackmailed by former criminal associates, framed for the murder of a man named Matt Herman if he refuses to spy for the crooks, who will sell the information to American enemies for a profit. Al agrees and goes to San Diego to begin his military service. Hank, Betty and friends follow, trailing clues that could help clear Als good name. They end up in the clutches of gangsters who take them hostage. Al discloses to superior officer Col. Halliday that the criminals want him to steal a Navy boat on the Germans behalf. Halliday has him go through with it, then attacks the Germans when they attempt to take the vessel. Al is killed in a heroic effort. He is praised by Halliday, who also feels Hank might be mature enough to enlist after all.
