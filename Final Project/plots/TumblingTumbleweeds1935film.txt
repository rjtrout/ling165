Gene Autry (Gene Autry) returns to his home after a five-year absence as a singing cowboy with a group of strolling players that includes Smiley (Smiley Burnette) and Eightball (Eugene Jackson), who sell Dr. Parkers Painless Panacea. Genes father, a cattle barron and one of the original "nesters" in the West, was recently murdered during a conflict with his landlord. While at an abandoned nesters cabin, the group is held up by Harry Brooks (Cornelius Keefe), whom Gene recognizes as his old friend. Wounded and semi-delirious, Harry induces Gene to hide him from the posse headed by Sheriff Manley (George Burton). The deputy later returns and tries to shoot Harry, but Gene chases him away. In town, the deputy reports to Barney Craven (Edward Hearn), leader of a gang which is trying to silence Harry. Meanwhile, Gene and his friends set up a performance in town, but it is interrupted by Cravens men, who report that Harry is wanted for the murder of Genes father. Hastening to Harrys home, Gene confronts his former sweetheart Janet, now Harrys wife, and meets Janets younger sister Jerry (Lucile Browne), whom he had only known as a girl. They assure Gene of Harrys innocence and reveal that Harry and Genes father were about to sign a settlement over disputed water rights. Now suspicious of Craven, Gene captures Craven, the deputy, and their cohorts by a series of clever ruses that land them in jail, and thereby vindicates Harry. Gene and Jerry marry and join Smiley and Eightball on the departing Parker wagon.
