Eastwood appears as a Southern cowboy Keith Williams who is upset over having to join up with a group of Yankees who have been attacked by the same group of Indians. Most film guides include in their entry for this film a quote attributed to Eastwood, "probably the lousiest Western ever made." This film is also notable for a scene in which Brady beats Eastwood in a fistfight.
