In 1984, 33 years after the events depicted in The Last Picture Show, 50-year-old Duane Jackson (Bridges) is a wealthy tycoon of a near-bankrupt oil company. His relationship with his family is not prospering, either. His wife, Karla (Annie Potts), believes that Duane is cheating on her, and his son, Dickie (William McNamara), seems to be following in his fathers libidinous footsteps. Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) works as Duanes secretary, and despondent Lester Marlow (Quaid), now a businessman, seems a prime candidate for a business crisis, a heart attack, or both. Sonny Crawfords (Bottoms) increasingly erratic behavior causes Duane concern over Sonnys mental health. Jacy Farrow (Shepherd) has traveled the world and experienced its pleasures. A painful tragedy brings her back to her hometown and once again into Duanes life.
