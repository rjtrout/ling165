Woody and Tex, a pair of American oilmen working in South America, both fall for a beautiful young woman they simply call "Havana." The more prosperous suitor is Tex, who just earned a $2,500 bonus, but Havana is more smitten with Woody, who lands in jail after using Havanas loaded dice in a craps game. Woody, fired from his job, is sprung by pal Tubby Waters, who is then killed by a man named Drenov in a fight. Woody avenges him by killing Drenov, whose job he is promptly offered as a gunrunner to Captain Lazear, a revolutionary. Sensing that he is in grave danger, Havana ventures into the jungle to find Woody near a hidden storehouse of ammunition and explosives. There she encounters Lazears jealous girlfriend, Chita, and pretends she and Woody are married. Tex arrives to help Woody fight off the revolutionaries, then is by their side again when Woody and Havana are actually wed.
