Ronald Reagan is Jeff Williams - a US army vet living in China who is on the run from the Red Army as the country falls to Communism. Along the way he comes across a Chinese orphan named Wei Lin who is carrying an ancient and valuable GOLDEN IDOL. Adventure ensues as Williams must outwit both the commies and Chinese gangsters while scheming to cash in on the idol himself. Reagan is great in the role, looking perfectly dynamic in action sequences and able to belt out classic no-nonsense one-liners. Rhonda Fleming is her usual stunning self, playing a humanitarian who is trying to aid Chinese refugees but instead finds herself caught up in the action.
