When the mining office of Charlie Storrs is robbed by two bandits, his right-hand man Larkin Moffatt gives chase. Larkin catches up to the riders, but then rides off, never to return. A furious Charlie fires him and spreads the word that Larkin is not a man to be trusted. Another very interested party is Josephine Storrs, who once was Larkins woman but has recently married Charlie instead. In the town of Silver City, where he isnt known, Larkin settles down and opens a mining assayers office. Candace Surrency is pleased when Larkin confirms the value of the ore sample she brought him, but distressed because her dad, Dutch, is leasing the mine and has just 12 days to get while he can before mineral rights revert to the already rich and wealthy RR Jarboe. Candaces foreman is beaten by a henchman of Jarboes. She tries to get Larkin to work for her, but he declines. Into town ride Charlie and Jo, curious about Silver City mining opportunities. They are shocked to find Larkin there. It soon becomes clear that Jo only married Charlie for his money, not for love. Jarboes men sabotage the mine. Candace continues to plead for Larkins help, but he resists. He does explain that he indeed was in on the robbery, planning it as a way to get more money for the greedy Jo, until a guilty conscious led him to leave for good, not spending the stolen loot. In a final gunfight, Larkin is able to shoot two of Jarboes henchmen. The only casualty is Candaces father, Dutch. As soon as the law can restore order, Larkin intends to see if he and Candace can become business partners and more.
