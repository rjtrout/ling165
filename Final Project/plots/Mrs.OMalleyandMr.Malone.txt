Montana housewife Hattie OMalley boards a train bound for New York because shes on her way to collect a prize shes won from a radio program. Getting on board in Chicago is criminal attorney John J. Malone, whose client, Steve Kepplar, just released from prison in Joliet, still owes him $10,000. Suspicion exists that Kepplar himself will be on the train, heading to New York to retrieve $100,000 he previously stashed from a robbery. Chicago detective Tim Marino is a passenger. So is the ex-convicts business partner, Myron Brynk, and his moll, a looker named Lola. Kepplar is indeed along for the ride, disguised as a sailor. Lola is in on it, hiding him in her compartment. But soon his dead body is found, followed by hers. More and more, the detective comes to believe lawyer Marino and even Hattie could be involved in this, but Brynk turns out to be the man hes after.
