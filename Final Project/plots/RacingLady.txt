Longtime thoroughbred breeder and trainer Tom Martin has a mare, Pepper Mary, hes about to enter in a big race. After the owner of another contender fails to bribe Tom to lose on purpose, his jockey causes Pepper Mary to stumble and fall during the race, causing a career-ending injury to the horse. Toms disappointed daughter Ruth concentrates all her efforts on Pepper Marys filly, Katydid, hoping she, too, can become an outstanding racehorse. Steve Wendel, an automobile mogul who has a stable of horses, buys the victorious horse after Ruth enters her in a Santa Anita claiming race. To stay with her horse, Ruth reluctantly accepts Steves offer to come work for him. They travel the racing circuit abroad, where Ruth matures from a tomboy into a sophisticated young woman. She falls in love with Steve, and after a misunderstanding over the disappearance of Katydid before a race, they celebrate as their horse races to another triumph.
