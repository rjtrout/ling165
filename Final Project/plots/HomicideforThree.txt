A Navy Lieutenant on shore leave and his wife of one year cant find a hotel room to enjoy their first night alone since they eloped a year earlier. An oddly dressed women in the lobby gives up her room in "an act of charity". The Navy Lieutenant then has his white uniform stolen while he is in the steam bath: and is given a civilian suit by the house dick. Shortly thereafter, sitting at the bar together, the Navy Lieutenant and his wife are approached by a somewhat distinguished fellow guest who confuses Iris Duluth with "her cousin Mona" whose picture had appeared in that mornings paper.
