He tells her that he is a hopeful country and western star and needs to raise money to make a demo tape of his songs. After hearing Neils musical talent, shes impressed and agrees to help by traveling with him, raising cash with her pinball skills. When the two eventually end up back in his hometown, Neil sets up a $3500 game between Tilt and the Whale.
