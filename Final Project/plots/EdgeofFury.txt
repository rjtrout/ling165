Wealthy young artist Richard Barrie owns a New England beach cottage. He agrees to rent it out to Florence Hackett and her two grown daughters, Eleanor and Louisa, and is invited by Florence to stay at the house with them. As he paints Florences portrait and befriends Eleanor, he is taunted by Louisa. It is revealed that Richard has been seeking psychiatric care. He becomes jealous upon seeing Louisa kissing a boyfriend and violently resists when Eleanor demonstrates a romantic attraction to him. Louisa attempts to help her sister attract Richards interest, but he physically abuses Eleanor instead. Florence demands that he leave until Richard reminds her that it is he who owns the cottage. She asks a neighbor boy to keep an eye on things when her daughters are away, but Richard kills the boy and then stabs Florence. The police come to take him away.
