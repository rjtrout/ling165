Dewey Hoople (Jack Moran) runs a broken down tourist trap along the Colorado River along with his French wife Babette (Babette Bardot) and his daughter Coral (Adele Rein). Business is so bad that Hoople must pay a local alcoholic (Frank Bolger as "Cracker") to entice tourists, called "suckers", to spend some time and money there.
