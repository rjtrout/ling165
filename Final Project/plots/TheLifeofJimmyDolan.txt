Southpaw boxer Jimmy Dolan believes in clean living outside the ring, but blonde vixen Goldie West gets him drunk after a fight. Then when reporter Magee plans to write about Jimmys behavior, a punch in the face accidentally kills Magee. With the fighter certain to face charges and possible incarceration, his manager Doc Woods makes off with Jimmys money and watch. Driving away with Goldie, they end up in a fiery car crash and are killed. Docs face is unrecognizable, and because hes wearing Jimmys watch, it is believed the boxer is dead. A detective, Phlaxer, is unconvinced. The watch is on the wrong wrist for a left-hander. Jimmy, trying to take advantage of the situation and begin a new life, disappears. On the verge of starvation, he comes across a farm run for crippled children by a young woman named Peggy and her aunt. He helps them with the kids as thanks for their hospitality. A charity match against boxer King Cobra is arranged to raise badly needed money for the farms mortgage. A photograph of Daugherty makes it obvious to Phlaxer that fugitive Jimmy Dolan is very much alive. He intends to take him into custody, but upon seeing how Jimmys life has changed for the better, the detective lets him remain free.
