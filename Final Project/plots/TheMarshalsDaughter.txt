After his wifes death, Ben Dawson retires and forms a traveling medicine show. His infant daughter Laurie grows up to be a sharpshooter and performer in the show. A banker named Anderson is behind a criminal scheme cheating ranchers out of their money. He hires notorious gunslinger Trigger Gans for protection. Ben realizes that Gans was the one who killed his wife. Laurie is glad that rancher Russ Mason is in love with her but, knowing something must be done about the unlawful deeds going on, disguises herself as "El Coyote" and conducts a form of vigilante justice. She ultimately fights Anderson one-on-one in a canyon. Victorious, she sheds her costume upon returning, but Russ spots it and realizes her secret identity, but her father does not.
