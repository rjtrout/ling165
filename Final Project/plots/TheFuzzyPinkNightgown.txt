Movie star Laurel Stevens (Jane Russell) has made a new film. It is called The Kidnapped Bride and gives a brainstorm to a couple of small-time crooks, Mike (Ralph Meeker) and Dandy (Keenan Wynn), to kidnap Laurel. While they take her to a Malibu beachfront hideout, agent Barney (Robert Harris) and studio chief Martin (Adolphe Menjou) cant figure out why Laurels a no-show at the premiere. Gossip columnist Daisy Parker (Benay Venuta) is dying to know, too, so a decision is made to avoid a scandal at all costs and not report Laurel missing to the police. Mike and Dandy want a $50,000 ransom. Laurel is insulted, feeling shes worth ten times that. Laurel also fears this thing could hurt her career by looking like a publicity stunt. When Los Angeles police sergeant McBride (Fred Clark), who once sent Mike to prison, comes to Malibu to do a routine check on him, Laurel alters her appearance and pretends to be Mikes girl. The studio finally goes to the cops and also offers a $100,000 reward. The ransom money is taken to the airport, which is where the not-too-bright Dandy has a job. McBride notices a portrait of Laurel at the studio and suddenly realizes where hes just seen her. Laurel has begun to fall for Mike for real. This time when McBride shows up, Laurel knocks him cold. She and Mike steal the cops car and race to the airport. They get nabbed by the cops, but dim Dandy has picked up the wrong suitcase. There is no crime so there are no arrests, particularly since Laurel and Mike are now in love.
