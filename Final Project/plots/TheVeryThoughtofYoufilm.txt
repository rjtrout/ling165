Away for a year and a half serving their country, Army Sergeants Dave (Dennis Morgan) and "Fixit" (Dane Clark) spend a three-day pass in Pasadena, also visiting Daves alma mater, Caltech. They meet two young women who work in a parachute factory. Cora (Faye Emerson) quickly catches Fixits eye, while Janet (Eleanor Parker) remembers Dave from school days. Upon realizing that Dave has no family nearby, Janet invites him home for Thanksgiving dinner. Her family does not treat him kindly. Janets mother does not approve of getting involved with a military man whos away all the time. One reason for that is Janets sister Molly (Andrea King), who is married to a sailor but seeing other men behind his back. Janets brother, classified 4-F, is rude to Dave as well. Only her father makes their dinner guest feel welcome. After a day at Mount Wilson runs long and causes them to be late getting Janet back home, but the couple cant bear to part, so Janet and Dave proceed to Coras apartment and fall asleep. It is 3 a.m. when he takes her home, where Janets mother slaps her. Dave must report for duty in San Diego, but is in love and marries Janet, enjoying a brief honeymoon. Molly disapproves and intercepts Daves letters to Janet. Janet decides to move out and live in Coras apartment. But when news comes that Dave and Fixit have been wounded in the war, everyone in Janets family finally relents. Molly even begs husband Fred (William Prince) for forgiveness and they reconcile. It takes months more, but Dave finally returns to rejoin his wife and meet their new baby boy.
