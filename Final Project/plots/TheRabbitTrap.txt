Since leaving the army ten years ago, Eddie has been working hard without any promotion, never missing a day of work and having only three weeks holiday in his ten years with his construction firm. The day after Eddie, his wife Abby and son Duncan are granted two weeks holiday they spend in a mountain cabin. On the first day Eddie and Duncan place a rabbit trap out in the countryside for the sheer joy of feeding and releasing him. Eddie is called back to work the next day leading to arguments with Abby who insists Eddie should remain on holiday. Eddie fears being left behind in promotion if he endangers his reputation for reliability. Upon returning home, Duncan realizes they left the trap set and a rabbit could be trapped inside. Duncan breaks his piggy bank and returns to the mountains by himself to save the rabbit. He tries to take the bus to back Deep Springs to save the rabbit. In the midst of this his Dad gets a promotion and Judy kisses the owner of the construction firm and gives her one-week notice. Eddie decided that it is more important to bring his son back to check the rabbit trap than his promotion and quits.
