Martin Sheen is Robert, the man - a sensitive, intelligent family man who, in one brief and innocent affair long past, fathered a child whose sudden appearance threatens his happy life. Blythe Danner is Sheila, the woman - a strong loving wife and mother whose deep love and commitment are stretched to the breaking point by the unexpected arrival of her husbands illegitimate son. Crafted in the tender tradition of "Love Story," what follows is an evocative, emotionally-charged movie about a typical American family whose deep love is shaken, tested and ultimately reaffirmed.
