Jean Hansen, a Juilliard graduate, joins the staff of the Crawthorne State Mental Hospital and immediately clashes with the director, Dr. Matthew Clark, about his strict training methods. She becomes emotionally involved with 12-year-old Reuben Widdicombe (Bruce Ritchey), and is certain his attitude will improve if he is reunited with the divorced parents who abandoned him. She sends for Mrs. Widdicombe, who agrees with the doctors opinion that it would be best if Reuben doesnt see her, but as she leaves the grounds, her son sees her and chases her car. Distraught, he runs away from the school. Dr. Clark finds him and brings him back the following morning, and Jean offers to resign. Clark asks her to stay and continue her rehearsals for the Thanksgiving pageant. On the day of the show, Reubens father Ted arrives, having decided to enroll him in a private school. When he hears Reuben recite a poem and positively react to the audiences applause, he decides to leave him in the care of Jean, who is asked to welcome a new boy to the institution by Dr. Clark.
