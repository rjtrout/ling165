A factory that manufactures pipe organs is converted into a munitions supplier for the war effort. While celebrating the firms 50th anniversary at a nightclub, Jonathan Chadwick, the companys president, makes a spectacle of himself over underdressed performer Linda Lane, unaware that her striptease is a part of her act. Linda ends up landing a job as Jonathans secretary at the plant. She also discovers that a rival company about to purchase the entire enterprise from Jonathan is defrauding him, falsely claiming that the plants shell casings are defective. Linda intends to leave for New York to resume her singing career until Jonathan persuades her to stay.
