Into a small, poor Appalachian Mountains community in the Great Depression era arrive a young widower, Wayland Jackson, a clockmaker, and his 12-year-old daughter. Wayland becomes respectfully acquainted with Collie Wright, a single mother of a newborn child, Jonathan. As he becomes more familiar to the villagers, Wayland tries to persuade them that he could build a beautiful clock for the public square. His proposal is met with considerable skepticism before he is given the towns consent. He is attracted to Collie, but his life and hers are threatened by family members from the Wright familys rival clan, the Campbells, led by patriarch Drury. The youngest son, Cole, is the father of Collies baby. Cole wanted to run away with Collie but ultimately left her out of fear of Drurys wrath. One night, Cole Campbell arrives in Collies cabin, and goes into a violent rage once he learns of Collie and Waylands relationship. Wayland and Cole get into a fistfight in the frozen pond near the cabin. Cole is found dead the next morning, whereupon his relatives demand that Collie now owes them a life and therefore must give them the child. Not wanting the Campbells to kill Wayland instead, Collie accepts. Wayland and Collie are soon engaged. Wayland confronts the Campbells and attempts to persuade Drury and his clan to end their feud with the Wrights, but they chase him away. The following spring, Drury appears at the wedding of Wayland and Collie, and returns Jonathan to his mother.
