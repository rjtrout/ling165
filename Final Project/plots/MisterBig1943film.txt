In a school for the dramatic arts called the Davis School of the Theatre, run by Jeremy Taswell, Donald (Donald OConnor) has written a musical comedy for the school play. But the owner of the school, Mrs. Davis (Florence Bates)(whose niece, played by Gloria Jean, secretly has a crush on Donald), disapproves and insists that they do a play by Sophocles instead. The students manage to change the play into a musical while Mrs. Davis is traveling to New York. Their triumph is short lived, however, for Mrs. Davis comes back from New York on opening night. At first she becomes quite angry at the students, but changes her tune when a Broadway producer agrees to finance the show and produce it in New York.
