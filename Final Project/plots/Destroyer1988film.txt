Ivan Mozer (Lyle Alzado) is a serial killer who has been convicted of the rape, torture, and murder of 23 people. Mozer is given the death penalty by electrocution. At his execution, he boasts of having killed 24 people. A power outage caused by a riot prevents the execution, but Mozer receives a jolt of electricity before the power fails. The prison staff assumes that Mozer is killed during the riot, but he manages to escape. The prison subsequently is abandoned. Mozer lives within the abandoned prison with the assistance of his father, who had been employed as a guard. Eighteen months later, a film crew arrives at the prison to shoot an exploitation film entitled Death House Dollies. They discover that Mozer survived his electrocution due to an unusual genetic gift. The jolt of electrical energy made him "half-alive", leaving him in a feral state and granting him spontaneous regeneration.
