Jack Scanlan is a union leader who returns to work after having a heart attack. His son Frank arranges a welcome back surprise party for Jack, which more than surprises him, as he has a heart attack and dies (hence the films name). His large, dysfunctional family is brought together and finds themselves dealing with all of their emotional baggage. Everybodys assorted issues are brought to light. The relatives include his children: eldest son Johnny, a tree surgeon who wants more adventure in his life; his brother Frank, a labor leader who wants to live up to his fathers expectations; their sister Tracy, a dancer; her ex-husband Boyd; an embalmer Peter, who is in love with Tracy; and a younger sister Nora, who is a nun based in Latin America. There are unfamiliar faces too, like a woman named Cassie who turns up at the funeral and may or may not have been their late fathers mistress. It is a chance for everyone to get acquainted or reacquainted, and its all in the family.
