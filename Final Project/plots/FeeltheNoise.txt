After a run-in with local thugs to raise money for a chance at a record deal, a Harlem born aspiring rapper of an African American Mother and Puerto Rican father..Rob (Omarion) flees to Puerto Rico and to a Puerto Rican father (Giancarlo Esposito) he never knew, and finds his salvation in Reggaeton, a spicy blend of hip-hop, reggae and Latin beats. Puerto Rico, the spiritual home of Reggaeton, inspires Rob and his step-brother Javi (Victor Rasuk) to pursue their dream of becoming Reggaeton stars. Together with a dancer named C.C., they learn what it means to stay true to themselves and each other, while overcoming obstacles in love, greed and pride, all culminating in an explosive performance at New Yorks Puerto Rican Day Parade.
