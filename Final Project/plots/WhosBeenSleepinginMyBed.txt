Jason Steel is an actor who plays a doctor on TV. He is so convincing that women of all kinds wont leave him alone. His poker buddies are envious, but his fianc√©e, art teacher Melissa, isnt at all happy. She is unaware that the women paying so much attention to Jason are the wives and girlfriends of his fellow poker players, who confuse his TV role with the real Jason. Melissa takes her frustration to her friend Stella, who hatches a scheme: They will pretend Melissa has fallen in love with another man and has decided to marry him, which will force Jasons hand. Complications ensue and a fake Mexico divorce must be arranged as well.
