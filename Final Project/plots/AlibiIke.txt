Frank X. Farrell (Joe E. Brown) is an ace baseball player whose insistence upon making up excuses earns him the nickname "Alibi Ike." In the course of his first season with the Chicago Cubs, Farrell also falls in love with Dolly Stevens (Olivia De Havilland), sister-in-law of the teams manager. Farrells "alibi" habit prompts Dolly to walk out on him, whereupon he goes into a slumpâ€”which coincides with attempts by gamblers to get Farrell to throw the World Series.
