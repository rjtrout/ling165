The film focuses on a sly fox, George, and a lovable but dimwitted hound, Willoughby, who repeatedly asks George where the fox went, never suspecting that his "friend" George is the fox. Invariably, George the Fox tells Willoughby that the fox is on the other side of a rail fence, which is actually at the edge of a steep cliff. Willoughbys line, "Which way did he go, George? Which way did he go?" long ago became a catchphrase, as did "Thanks a lot, George, thanks a lot!"
