Shoe store owner Amalfi (Leo Carrillo) is forced by crook Speedy Miller (Broderick Crawford) to allow the business to be a front for illegal gambling. Miller works for a crime boss Horace Grover "the Brain" (Samuel S. Hinds), managing editor of a newspaper. Jimmy Rupert (John Howard) is a clerk in the store and sells a pair of shoes to Miller that are too small and hurt his feet. Distracted by his pinched feet in the "tight shoes", Miller places a losing bet on the horse named Feet First. A fight ensues with his girlfriend Sybil Ash (Binnie Barnes) and she leaves him. He blames his loss on Rupert and gets him fired from the shoe store. In response, Rupert complains about crooked politicians who allow crime to flourish, and successfully runs for office. He is opposed by the newspaper, but supported by Millers ex-girlfriend Sybil Ash. On the day he wins the election, Rupert and Ash are engaged to be married. Amalfi ends up hiring Miller as a clerk in his store. On the wedding day, Miller sends a pair of "tight shoes" to Rupert as a wedding gift.
