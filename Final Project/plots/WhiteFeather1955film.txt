The story of the peace mission from the US cavalry to the Cheyenne Indians in Wyoming during the 1870s. The Cheyenne agree to leave their hunting grounds so that white settlers can move in to search for gold. Colonel Lindsay (John Lund) and land surveyor Josh Tanner (Robert Wagner) are in charge of the resettlement, but the mission is threatened when Appearing Day (Debra Paget), the sister of Little Dog (Jeffrey Hunter) and fianc√© of Cheyenne tribesman American Horse (Hugh OBrian), falls for Tanner. When Appearing Day runs away to join Tanner at the fort, American Horse follows and while he is captured, he is later freed by Little Dog and the two ride off to the hills. Tanner, Col. Lindsay and a troop of soldiers go to the Cheyenne camp where Chief Broken Hand (Eduard Franz) has agreed to sign a peace treaty. After the signing, a warrior rides up and throws down a knife with a white feather attached, a declaration of war by American Horse and Little Dog against all the soldiers. Tanner convinces the Chief to allow the matter to be resolved between themselves.
