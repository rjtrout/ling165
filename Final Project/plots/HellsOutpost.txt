Tully brings letters dictated by Al, who had lost the use of his hands. Kevin is grateful, saying Al had mentioned his friend Tully in previous correspondence. Wealthy local bully Ben Hodes takes a dislike to Tully, particularly his attentions to Sarah Moffit, a woman Ben wants to have for himself. Challenged to a fight, Tully says he will oblige, provided Ben lends him $10,000 if he wins. Tully then knocks him cold. Ben keeps his end of the bargain, but after Tully uses the money to begin a rival mining enterprise, Ben sabotages a bulldozer, organizes a roadblock and impedes Tully wherever he attempts to go. Sarah confides in Sam Horne, the newspaper publisher, that she doubts the authenticity of Tullys story about Als letters. An attempt by Ben to blow up Tullys mine with dynamite backfires, leaving Ben dead. Tully discovers that Kevin has known all along that he wrote the letters from Korea himself, pretending the sentiments were Als. He is forgiven, by Sarah as well.
