The Stooges wake up one bright morning and happily realize that they are about to get married. After breakfast, they start cleaning the house. The usual antics occur as the boys make a near shambles of their home. The trio try to reupholster a davenport, but end up clobbering Moe on several counts. First, Larry attempts to cut the upholstering with a scissor and ends up trimming Moes sport coat. Then, to speed things up, they pour the upholstering tacks into a machine gun and aim at the davenport. The rapid fire release works well at first, but when Moe bends over the davenport to straighten the material, Larry and Joe argue over who gets to fire the next round while each holding onto the rifle It inadvertently fires sending about a dozen of the sharp wayward tacks into Moes backside which causes him to exclaim, "Im losing my mind!". After Larry and Joe quickly remove the tacks, Moe manages to swallow one. The Stooges then head their separate ways to marry their sweetheart â€” unaware they are all engaged to the same girl Mabel (Connie Cezon). In rapid succession, Larry, Moe, and then Joe appear at their fiancees home with engagement rings of varying sizes. When the boys discover their error, a nutty fight ensues. Moe and Larry eventually knock each other cold. However, Joe who had left earlier during the fracas, returns just as the frightened gold digger is about to make a quick exit and tricks her into bending over for some purposely dropped money then quickly moves behind her and fires the tack-filled rifle into Mabels posterior with stinging accuracy, then begins spanking her with the butt end of the rifle while calling her a "jezebel" as the two timer wails in agony.
