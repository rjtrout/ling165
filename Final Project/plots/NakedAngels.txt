The story concerns a death feud between two rival biker gangs. The Angels are out to revenge themselves on the Las Vegas Hotdoggers, who severely beat their leader, Mother (Michael Greene). As the story opens, Mother is just returning to the Angels and his old lady, Marlene (Jennifer Gan) who had become the property of Fingers (Richard Rust) the new head of the clan. When Mother reappears he quickly reassumes leadership of the gang as well as the rights to the strawberry blond, lascivious, foul-mouthed Marlene. The Angels go looking for the Hotdoggers at their hangout, a bar in Las Vegas. Not finding their rivals, the Angels bust up the bar and terrorize the local citizenry. A lone Hotdogger betrays his gang and tells the Angels of a secret mine hangout in the desert where they can find his gang. Later that evening, Mother and Marlene are riding his chopper around Vegas, when a showgirl in a car catches his eye. He splits with the showgirl and when he returns, Marlene is livid with rage. Setting out into the desert, the Angels and Mother argue about what to do and how to travel through the desert. Marlene opens her mouth and says what everyone in the gang is thinking. Mother gets angry and says that everyone in the gang can have Marlene. There are no takers, as even the gang members cannot go so low, so Mother takes off on his own. The Angels and finally Mother meet again at the mine hideout with the Hotdoggers. A stick of dynamite brings the Hotdoggers out of the mine for a vicious brawl with tire chains, knives, fists and boots. The Hotdogger leader steals an Angels bike but Mother rides him down and finishes him off while the Angels look on and cheer. After taking revenge on all the Hotdoggers, Fingers and Mother fight it out at the end, but only one can be leader of the Angels.
