Alice Kendall is the darling of her social set, the sons and daughters of millionaires, although Alices mother has impoverished herself to provide Alice the luxuries she expects as her right. Mom blows whats left of her fortune to provide the best trousseau that money can buy when Alice marries Fred Garlan, and then wishes Fred lots of luck. Now, Alice is trying to coax Fred into buying her a new sable coat---all of her friends are sporting them---while Fred is busily trying to borrow enough money to keep his business afloat. The marriage business certainly isnt working as Alice wants. She just doesnt know how she can be seen if she isnt wearing a new sable coat. But help is lurking just around the corner in the form of a sleaze-ball named Morrell. Hes a stock-broker and he is a bachelor and he enjoys the benefits of married life by making available sable coats to little brides who are in dire need of one and whose husbands cant meet their needs.
