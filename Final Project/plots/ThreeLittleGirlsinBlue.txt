In 1902 Red Bank, New Jersey, sisters of modest means Pam (June Haver), Liz (Vivian Blaine), and Myra Charters (Vera-Ellen) inherit a chicken farm from their aunt. They soon discover that the windfall is not quite enough to finance their dreams of attracting and marrying millionaires. Reasoning that if one of them catches a rich husband, the other two will thereafter find it easier to do the same, they decide to pool their inheritances. Pam poses as a wealthy heiress, Liz poses as her social secretary, and Myra poses as her maid. The three go to Atlantic City, check into a luxurious hotel, and promptly meet millionaire Steve Harrington (Frank Latimore). When Steve sends a bottle of champagne to Pam, Myra meets Mike (Charles Smith), a waiter who becomes taken with her. A third man, Steves friend Van Damm Smith (George Montgomery), ostensibly another millionaire, joins in the following day when the girls plot to interest Steve by pretending to be drowning goes awry. Steve and Van both court Pam, while Myra and Mike fall in love. Although ostensibly pursuing Pam, Steve begins to be attracted to Liz. Van proposes to Pam; however, she tells him the truth about her plan to marry a rich man and he in turn reveals that he is not really rich and is also scheming to marry a rich woman. The two call off their romance, deciding to stick to their plans of marrying money. Van helps Pam by telling Steve that she is in love with him; Steve proposes to Pam and she accepts. The couples are all sorted out after a trip to Harringtons family home in Maryland, with some help from Steves sister Miriam (Celeste Holm). Steve finally realizes he is in love with Liz, Van and Pam decide they would rather be with one another, and Mike and Myra are married.
