Director Salvador Litvak and his writing partner, Nina Davidovich Litvak, based their screenplay on their extensive research into Lincolns friendship with Lamon. Saving Lincoln charts their relationship from their initial meeting to Lincolns Presidency. Lamon was a tall, boisterous Southerner who liked to drink whiskey, tell jokes and stories, play the banjo, and wrestle. Despite some pronounced differences between the two men, they shared a fondness for telling jokes and stories, and both felt slavery should be eliminated. Lamon often served as Lincolns private confidant. The movie jumps from their initial meeting to Lincolns presidency and the repeated attempts that were made on his life. Many well-known incidents are recounted, including the plot to kill Lincoln in Maryland, while he was traveling to Washington, D.C. after his first election – Lamon worked with Allan Pinkerton, who founded the famous Pinkerton Detective Agency, to thwart that plan. Other events include the time a bullet went through Lincolns hat while he was riding his horse late one evening – he blamed it on a hunter firing an errant shot, but Lamon saw it as a sign that Lincoln was in mortal danger and needed even tighter security. Lamon was said to sometimes sleep by Lincolns bedroom door, a striking image that appears in the film. Themes in the story involve Lincolns anguish over Civil War casualties, his conflicts with members of his cabinet, and the death of the Lincolns son Willie, which drove Mary Todd Lincoln to the depths of despair. Such situations complicate Lamons efforts to keep Lincoln safe.
