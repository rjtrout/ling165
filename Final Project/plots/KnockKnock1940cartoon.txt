The cartoon ostensibly stars Andy Panda (voice of Sara Berner) and his father, Papa Panda (voice of Mel Blanc), but it is Woody (voice of Blanc) who steals the show. Woody Woodpecker constantly pesters the two pandas, apparently just for the fun of it. Andy, meanwhile, tries to sprinkle salt on Woodys tail in the belief that this will somehow capture the bird. To Woodys surprise, Andys attempts prevail (comically, the mound of salt placed on Woodys tail is so heavy that he cannot run away), and in an ending very similar to 1938s Daffy Duck & Egghead, Woody is taken away to the funny farmâ€”where his captors prove to be crazier than he is.
