In World War II Austria, Col. Alois Podhajsky sets out to protect his beloved Lipizzaner stallions - purebred snow-white horses with centuries of tradition - from starving refugees and from the advancing Soviet Army who might view them as a source of meat, and ensure that they are surrendered into safekeeping. It is known that U.S. General George S. Patton is something of a horse fancier and might help, if he sees the stallions perform. The ending is happy; see the Lipizzaner main article for the historical details.
