In order to save them from extinction, explorer Grantland Cunningham (Stanley Ferrar) engages animal trainer Clyde Beatty to accompany him to Africa to capture a few of the last known Nubian lions. The pair run afoul of hunters led by Gorman (John Doucette) who wish to kill rather than capture the big cats. Beatty and Cunningham are aided in their quest by humanitarian Jo Carter (Phyllis Coates). Gorman is nearly killed by a gorilla and when Clyde saves him, he offers to help find lions. The expedition to Southern Rhodesia takes the two men into dangerous tribal areas. After a series of dangerous encounters, both Clyde and Grant make it back to safety, vowing to set out on more adventures in the future.
