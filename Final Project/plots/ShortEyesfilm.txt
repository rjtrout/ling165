Short Eyes is set in an unnamed prison in New York City, whose inmates are predominantly black or Puerto Rican. One day, Clark Davis, a young, middle-class white man accused of raping a young girl, arrives. His fellow prisoners immediately turn on him — pedophiles are considered the lowest form of prison life — except for Juan, one of the institutions older prisoners, who treats him with dignity. While Davis insists he doesnt remember raping the girl, he admits that he has molested several other children. The prosecutions case against Davis is weak and, unless Juan tells prison authorities about Davis confessions to him, it is only a matter of time before he is set free. As Juan struggles with what to do, the other prisoners plan to get rid of Davis permanently.
