Chris Morrell (John Wayne), the guardian of half-Indian girl Nina (Shirley Jean Rickert), is helping her find her missing white father, so she can cash in on her late mothers oil lease. Outlaw Sam Black (Yakima Canutt) is after the girl and her father as well. Besides dealing with the Black gang, Morrell has to find another robber, Jim Moore, who switches clothes with him when he finds Morrell unconscious after a fight with Sam Black. Along the way, he meets a woman who is the sister of Jim Moore (Buffalo Bill Jr.), another bad hombre in cahoots with Moore, and an old friend who takes in Nina and helps Morrell locate Ninas father and fight off the various desperadoes. George "Gabby" Hayes played a featured character with a speaking role, but his name was omitted from the cast list in the opening credits.
