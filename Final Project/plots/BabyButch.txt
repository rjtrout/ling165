Butch is walking down an alleyway at night picking up food. He sees a bottle of milk and ham at Tom and Jerrys house, but Tom retrieves both items before Butch can steal them. Seeing their full refrigerator and determined to gain access to it, Butch disguises himself as an abandoned baby on the doorstep in order to gain Toms sympathy and infiltrate the house. Crying and talking like a baby, Butchs ruse works, and Tom brings him into the house. Butch takes the ham, but is forced to stay in disguise as Tom tries to give him aid, while at the same time, fight off Jerry, wanting to steal the ham for himself. Tom dumps Butch into a boiling water bath, but Butch kicks Tom into it and chases Jerry, in possession of the ham. After Butch bumps himself, he gains sympathy from Tom by pointing at Jerry and crying, but Jerry turns the tables and alerts Tom to Butch, who has now stolen everything in the refrigerator. His cover blown, Butch knocks Tom out and flees, but Jerry slams a door against Butch, leaving Butch empty-handed. Tom and Jerry then eat the ham together for dinner, but Butch, still in his baby disguise, appears and asks for some ham. Amused by Butchs nerve, Tom passes the ham to him. Butch seemingly only cuts a small amount for himself. But he then steals the entire ham and gobbles it down greedily, fighting off Tom and Jerry.
