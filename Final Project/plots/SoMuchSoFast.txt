So Much So Fast documents 5 years in the life of Stephen Heywood who, at 29, discovers he had the paralyzing neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease). Determined to live as well as possible, Stephen gets married, has a son and rebuilds two houses. His and his wife Wendy’s observations of the world and his disease explore the fragility of life. The film also tracks his familys response to the drug companies that ignore his disease because there is not enough profit in curing it, and his brother, Jamie Heywoods, creation of the ALS Therapy Development Foundation research facility to find a cure for Stephens disease in time.
