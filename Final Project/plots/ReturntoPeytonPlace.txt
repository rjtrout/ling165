After the phenomenal success of her first novel, Metalious hastily penned a sequel centering on the life and loves of bestselling author Allison MacKenzie, who follows in the footsteps of her mother by having an affair with a married man, her publisher Lewis Jackman. The similarity of their situations bond Allison and her mother. When she returns to her hometown following the publication of her first novel, Samuels Castle, she is forced to face the wrath of most of its residents, who are incensed by their barely disguised counterparts and the revelation of town secrets in the book. Despite that, certain members of the community stood by the MacKenzies, most notably, Seth Buswell, the newspaper editor; and his oldest friend, Dr. Matthew Swain. In fact, whenever anyone came into Dr. Swains office and complained about Allisons book, he would roar them down and after a harsh tongue-lashing from him about some of the things that person had done, he or she wouldnt ever complain about Allisons novel after that. However, Roberta Carter, a member of the school board (working in concert with the town attorneys wife Marion Partridge), makes it her mission to ban the book from the high school library. She punishes Allison by firing her stepfather, Michael Rossi (a decision which she eventually reverses, to the anger of Marion); while at the same time trying to dissolve her son Teds marriage to his snobbish bride, a Boston blue-blood named Jennifer Burbank. Another union in trouble is that of Allisons mother Constance, who is shocked by her daughters expos√©, but nonetheless stands by her, and stepfather Michael Rossi, the school principal and one of the novels defenders. Betty Anderson returns from New York, after giving birth to Roddy, the child she had by Rodney Harrington and, along with her co-hort and Roddys babysitter, Agnes Carlisle, moves to Peyton Place, so she can allow Leslie, Roddys grandfather to know him. Selena Cross, who had been acquitted of murder in the previous novel, was trying to make a life for herself and her brother, Joey. She is manager of the Thrifty Corner Apparel Shoppe, and is a success. In this book, Selena and Allison had rebonded as friends, and Allisons New York roommate, Stephanie Wallace, was also part of their circle.
