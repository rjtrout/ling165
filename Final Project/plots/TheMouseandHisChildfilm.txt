The mouse and his child are two parts of a single small wind-up toy, which must be wound by a key in the fathers back. After being unpacked, they discover themselves in a toy shop where they befriend a toy elephant and toy seal. The child mouse proposes staying at the shop to form a family, which the other toys ridicule. They accidentally fall out of a window and land in the trash. Once transported to the dump, they become enslaved by Manny the rat, who runs a casino and uses broken wind-up toys as his slave labor force. With the aid of a psychic frog, the mice escape and meet other animal characters on a quest of becoming free and independent self-winding toys. They rediscover the elephant and seal, who are somewhat broken down. Together they manage to form a family and destroy the rat empire.
