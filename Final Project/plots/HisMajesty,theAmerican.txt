As described in a film magazine, Bill (Fairbanks), whose hair raising antics have made him the talk of New York City, decides to leave the metropolis after a new district attorney starts cracking down on minor offenses, and visits Mexico in search of adventure. He receives a telegram for a foreign country asking him to come at once to its capital. At the train station he is met by a mysterious stranger and told he will be summoned when the time is right. A rebellion is brewing and the plotters seek to capture him, but Bill eludes them. The King (Southern) gathers his court around him while the rabble, headed by the traitorous Minister of War, storm the castle. Bill dons the uniform of an army officer and goes to an outlying garrison, and returns to the capital with the troops and restores quiet. The King presents Bill as heir apparent and future ruler of the country. Bills romance with a pretty member of the court is allowed to progress to the altar.
