Struggling young actors (three males and three females) share an apartment to make ends meet. This scenario is pretty daring considering the conservative and censorious attitudes of that period. The landlady provides a play to the actors that turns out to have been left behind long ago by a destitute, evicted tenant (Robert Benchley). That former tenant is now a successful theater producer and playwright who has recently taken a room in his old haunts to recharge his creativity and try to rewrite his first playâ€”one that the landlady had kept when he was evicted. The young actors attempt to sell his own play to him. Complications begin when Cousin Muriel (Florence MacMichael) visits and discovers the sinful cohabitation; she tattles to her folks, who charge over to investigate and drag the daughters home. Silliness and mayhem ensue, propelled by Muriels actions and highlighted by her unique little-girl, tattletale voice.
