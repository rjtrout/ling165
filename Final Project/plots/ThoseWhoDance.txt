Monte Blue plays as a police detective who is after a famous gangster (played by William Boyd). He disguises himself and lives in the very house of the famous gangster by pretending he is an out-of-town gangster who has just murdered someone. He pretends he is the sweetheart of an innocent girl (played by Lila Lee) who suspects her brother has been framed for murder by Monte Blue. Blues moll, played by Betty Compson, is also in on the conspiracy as she had become fed up with his cheating, lying and brutal treatment. The life of Lees brother, who has been sentenced to death in the electric chair, depends on them getting evidence against Boyd.
