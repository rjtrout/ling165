"Clay Bidwell" is a young man in a small town who witnesses his friend, "Earl," kill himself because of the ongoing affair that Clay was having with the mans wife, "Amanda." Feeling guilty, "Clay" now resists the widow when she presses him to continue with their affair as if nothing has happened. Clays problems worsen when he inadvertently befriends a serial killer named Lester Long, who murders the nagging widow in an attempt to "help" his "fishing buddy." Clay is horrified, but does not go to the police for fear of his role in his friends suicide coming to light, but that doesnt matter for the police, as well as for savvy female FBI agent "Dale Shelby" and her partner Reynard, who see Clay as their prime suspect. Yet Clay doesnt tell them of his "friend," who has confessed his crimes to him.
