On an island of Hong Kong’s New Territories, a ship’s cargo of nitroglycerin washes ashore due to a typhoon. The islanders claim the cargo under the law of salvage, but the powerful Nico Patrai threatens to destroy the island and its inhabitants if the nitroglycerine is not given to him in three days. The village head Win Lim and two other islanders escape Patrai’s men to go to Macau where they seek the help of soldier of fortune Rick Masters who lives on a junk. Masters defeats some of Patrai’s henchmen who have pursued the villagers. Win Lim offers him one third of the profits of the cargo if he can transport it to Hong Kong. Masters recruits some of his friends to take on Patrai.
