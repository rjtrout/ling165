Outside Jerry’s house, Quacker is inconsolable, because he thinks he must be ugly after reading The Ugly Duckling and noticing the duck in the picture looks like him. Hes so sad as he attempts suicide by using a large axe, but Jerry saves him. Jerry tries to make Quacker smile by dressing him up nicely, but when Quacker sees his reflection in a broken mirror, he still believes is ugly and cries even harder. Despaired, Quacker finds Tom and asks him to eat him. Tom is about to oblige when Jerry rescues him again. Quacker tries to make himself more appetizing by putting himself in a sandwich, but as Tom is about to eat him, Quacker loses his nerve and jumps out. After apologizing, Quacker jumps onto Tom’s tongue, and as he slides down his throat, he is again rescued by Jerry. Quacker next jumps into a pie and asks Tom to eat it, but Tom refuses at first. After some persuasion, Tom finally tries to eat the pie with Quacker in it, but Jerry pulls Quacker from the pie and throws it into Tom’s face. To cheer up Quacker, Jerry gives him a make-over, using a mud face pack, a girdle and some curlers, despite the demotivated Quacker claims that its no use. Tom sneaks up and grabs Quacker, and runs off with him, but when he sees how horrible Quacker looks, Tom, terrified, tries to escape by clawing through a brick wall, making Quacker realize how ugly he looks. Quacker is now sure that he must be really hideous, and places a paper bag over his head so that nobody can see his face again. As Quacker sits despondently, a passing female duckling lifts up the bag, and declares him to be “cute”. Quacker throws the bag away, they kiss, and walk off into the sunset together.
