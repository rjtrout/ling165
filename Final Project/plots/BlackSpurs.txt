Santee becomes a bounty hunter to earn enough to marry Anna, the woman he loves. But when he returns to their Kansas town, she has married the sheriff instead. Out of spite, Santee schemes with land baron Kile to ruin the towns reputation so a railroad will be built by Kiles property instead. He arranges for a brothel madam, Sadie, and her employees to come to town. Reverend Tanner and other townspeople are appalled. When things get out of hand, Tanner even being tarred and feathered, Santee changes sides. He helps clean up the community, then rides away, wishing Anna well.
