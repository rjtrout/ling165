Dog superstar Rexxx lives the high life-with adoring crowds, a loving owner and an array of best-selling blockbusters under his belt. However, when his owner, Trey (Dash Mihok) tries to convince him to perform a skydiving stunt, the plane malfunctions and Rexxx is sent tumbling from the sky, landing in a truck full of tomatoes. Whilst Trey mourns his apparent death and begins to regret not treating him like a real dog, Rexxx settles into an abandoned warehouse, desperately missing his owner. Meanwhile, Shane Fahey (Josh Hutcherson) is struggling with his uncle Marcs death from a recent fire. Realizing he forgot to study for a test, Shane ditches school, but is quickly caught by two other firefighters, Lionel and Terrence. Arriving back at the fire station in disgrace, he is chastised by his father Connor Fahey (Bruce Greenwood), the captain of the station, who is having problems of his own; the station Dogpatch, home to Engine 55, Rescue 26, is about to be closed due to a lack of funding, less infrastructure remaining around the station, and overall bad publicity. However, before Connor can properly address his sons problems, "Dogpatch" is called out to put out a fire in a warehouse-Shane is reluctantly dragged along. Although the fire is quickly put out, Shane notices a terrified Rexxx balancing on top of the burning building; Connor manages to rescue him, and orders Shane to put up Lost Dog flyers. Due to the name on his collar, which is a prop from the filming at the time of Rexxxs accident, the station renames the dog Dewey, and keeps him at the station until someone comes to claim him. Whilst city manager Zachary Hayden (Steven Culp) reminds Connor of the stations upcoming shutdown, Shane struggles to cope with Deweys spoilt needs and strange habits. Realizing that the dog is fast and active, Shane enters him in a firefighters competition, where they are pitted against rival fire station Greenpoint. Although Dewey initially beats Greenpoints record score, he is distracted by their dog, who reminds him of his time in stardom. Despite losing the competition, Shane and Dewey begin to bond. Soon after, Engine 55 is called out to yet another fire, one of the many suspected arsons that have been surrounding the area. Realizing that Greenpoints captain, Jessie Presley, is still trapped inside as the building begins to collapse, Connor rushes into the wreckage, and Shane, fearing for his fathers safety, allows Dewey to run in after him. Dewey manages to alert Connor to Jessies presence, subsequently saving her life. Following this, Engine 55 begins to gain popularity, as they realize that Dewey could become a potential firehouse dog. Due to their sudden increase in popularity, Zachary eagerly notifies them that the station is saved. However, Shanes excitement is lost when he discovers his father has moved to his uncles former office. Angered that his dad is trying to take his uncles place, he roots through the files, where he discovers an unnerving number of suspected arsons, all in the general area that station 55 is responsible for. Upset that Shane felt he was being neglected, Connor makes an effort to reconcile with his son, and is shocked when Shane reveals that he feels like a bad person for being relieved when he discovered it was his uncle who died instead of his father. The next day, at a firefighters gala, Dewey is awarded a medal for his bravery, but the moment is ruined when Dewey spots Trey in the audience, and abandons Shane for his former owner. Although Shane is heartbroken, Connor reluctantly allows an ecstatic Trey to keep the dog. A few hours later, however, Dewey escapes Treys hotel room to chase after Engine 55, which was recently called out to another fire. The team is only too happy to allow him to climb on board. Meanwhile, Shane returns to the station to discover that the fire Engine 55 was called out to was simply a decoy, so that the suspected arsonist could burn the "Dogpatch" station to the ground. Panicking, he calls Jessie Presleys daughter, Jasmine JJ Presley to work out what to do, then becoming alerted of footsteps upstairs, which turn out to be the arsonist. Ignoring JJs warnings, he heads upstairs to confront the arsonist. To his horror, he realizes that the arsonist is in fact city manager Zach Hayden, who wanted to burn buildings in order to build a football stadium for Corbin Sellars (Matt Cooke), killing Shanes uncle in the process. After Engine 55s closure was denied, he had no choice but to burn the station down himself, but didnt realize that Shane was still in the building. As the two become trapped inside the burning building when Zacharys incendiary device ignites a gas line, Zachary quickly gives up his search for Shane, who is unconscious, and then leaves. Meanwhile, Dewey, sensing that Shane is in danger, races back to the station as Connor follows behind, having been alerted to the fire by Jessie, who was also at the harbor fire and called by her daughter JJ. Dewey finds Zachary trying to escape, and traps him in a phone booth (which he also escapes from) before finding Shane. Connor arrives on the scene, only to find the station completely inaccessible. Hearing Deweys barking, he eventually manages to break down the garage door and finds Shane terrified on the other side of a locked door inside the burning station. Shane manages to convince him to pass him his axe through some broken glass so he can try to break the hinges himself, despite the risks of letting the fire get fresh oxygen and flashover; Dewey then leads them out. Shane manages to tell Connor about Zacharys arson attacks before he is sent to the hospital. Furious, Connor confronts Zachary for endangering his family, and Pep gets her own payback on him before the other Dogpatch firefighters hand Zachary over to the police to be arrested. Corbin Sellars scam is exposed and he is arrested. Following the events of the fire, all of the firefighters of Engine 55 are awarded medals, including Shane and Dewey. Upon seeing how happy Dewey is with them, Trey allows Shane to keep him, adding that now that Dewey has been a true hero, he wont be content with just acting like one. Both Shane and Connor are overjoyed, with Dewey realizing his true potential as a firehouse dog. "Dogpatch" is repaired and restored from the fire damage it sustained, and Engine 55 receives a brand-new engine so they wont be last to fires anymore. Dewey joins the engine crew as they head out on another call.
