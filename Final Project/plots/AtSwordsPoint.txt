The sons (and a daughter) of the original Four Musketeers ride to the rescue of besieged Queen Anne in 1648 France. DArtagnan and his companions are alerted that the terminally ill Queen (Gladys Cooper) is being pressured by the evil Duc de Lavalle (Robert Douglas) into agreeing to a marriage with Princess Henriette (Nancy Gates). Too old (or dead) to respond, their sons (and one daughter) race to Court to help. After much derring do – including episodes of imprisonment and betrayal, with a burgeoning love sub-plot between DArtagnan Jr. and Claire, daughter of Athos (Maureen OHara) thrown in for good measure – they succeed.
