Former jewel thief and reformed detective Michael Lanyard (Warren William), or the Lone Wolf, is driving to a party with his butler Jamison (Eric Blore). Halfway through the journey, they come across Eve Andrews (Marguerite Chapman), who requests that they bring her to Harry Cooper (Gerald Mohr)s residence. Meanwhile, Cooper, an unprofessed criminal, is carrying out a scheme to loot the jewelry of select wealthy persons â€” namely, Jane Merrick (Mona Barrie), Sonia Budenny (Tala Birell) and Andrews. Cooper is killed before he can finish his plans by an unknown assailant. Lanyard, who happens to be at the scene, is pinpointed by the suspicious police as the perpetrator. He escapes but is found by magazine writer Sidney Shaw (Warren Ashe), who agrees not to rat Lanyard out in exchange for a scoop. The Lone Wolf interrogates the women at the murder scene but is unable to find a lead. He is then captured by two criminals working under Arthur (Louis Jean Heydt), Coopers right-hand man. Lanyard breaks free and flees, reuniting with Jamison and Shaw. The trio sneak into Coopers house and decide to tail Arthur, who is leaving for the airport. The criminal turns out to be meeting a female teen named Patricia Blake (Margaret Hayes). Unaware of Coopers death, she becomes distressed when the news is broken to her. Arthur and Blake later leave for a hotel. In the middle of his confidence trick on Blake, Arthur is halted by Lanyard, Jamison, and Shaw, who rush into the hotel room. A heated fight ensues, with Arthur managing to escape. Blake injures herself and is quickly attended to by Shaw. When she admits her love for Cooper, Shaw seethes in infuriation. Lanyard realizes that Blake is Shaws spouse and by piecing two-and-two together, he concludes that Shaw was Coopers killer. The police arrive in time to arrest the jealous lover and the Lone Wolf is exonerated from all charges.
