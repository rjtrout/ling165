Capt. John Larsen, a Marine, stationed in the Philippines, loses a hand in an accident and is discharged from the Corps. An American general is held captive by Filipino guerrillas behind Japanese lines and Larsen is later re-enlisted to rescue him. He fastens a steel prosthetic hook, the “steel claw” of the title, and embarks on the mission to rescue the general which leads him and his team, (his pal Santana and a band of guerillas), deep into the Philippines where love and death await them.
