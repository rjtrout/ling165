Two buddies run into each other on a remote South Seas island where revolution is a daily happening. Recruited by the CIA to overthrow a power-mad dictator, their mission is to raise an army. But the choices are few and the odds are high - until a beautiful freedom fighter shows them the way. Battling the odds and themselves, these two mercenaries become something they never thought they would - heroes.
