During World War II, Jean Picard (Errol Flynn) is a convicted killer being led to the guillotine. He escapes during an air raid but is captured by French Sûreté Inspector Marcel Bonet (Paul Lukas). They learn that a bridge has been blown up by three saboteurs, and that the Germans have taken 100 hostages who will be killed unless the saboteurs are apprehended by the Vichy police. To buy time in order to escape again, Picard persuades Bonet to let him pose as one of the saboteurs to save the hostages. In the course of enacting a story that will convince the Vichy that Picard is one of the escaped saboteurs, he and Bonet encounter the real saboteur, captured by the Vichy, and aid him in escaping. Picard falls in love with Marianne (Jean Sullivan), a local girl, and with freedom just ahead for both of them, struggles with his conscience over the fate of the hostages, her trust in him, and his own perception of himself.
