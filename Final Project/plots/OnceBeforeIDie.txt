Shortly after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attack the Philippine islands. A group of polo-playing soldiers of the 26th Cavalry Regiment (United States) and their families are surprised while playing a polo game. Major Bailey orders his Swiss fiancee Alex to leave the country, promising to meet her in San Francisco. Bailey leads his men back to Manila, but the roads are jammed with fugitives - including Alex who delayed her return home to get her pet dog. During the ensuing journey, Baileys men kill a Japanese pilot who has jumped out of his plane. It becomes clear that Lt Custer is sadistic and enjoying the war. Bailey leads his men to a house where there is an enemy attack. Bailey sends Alex away - but before she leaves she witnesses him being accidentally killed by an exploding hand grenade. Alex forms a bond with a virginal soldier and has sex with him. He dies. Lieutenant Custer leads a pointless raid on an enemy stronghold, resulting in a massacre in which all of the Americans are killed. Alex is left alone. She kills a young Japanese soldier and wanders down to a beach.
