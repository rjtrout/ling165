Dr. Andre Crespi (von Stroheim) hates Dr. Stephen Ross (Bohn), who married Crespis girlfriend, Estelle (Harriet Russell). During surgery, Ross appears to die. Crespi has given Ross a drug that induces a state of apparent death, while Ross retains all of his senses. Dr. John Arnold (Guilfoyle) is then asked to exhume Ross by the suspicious Dr. Thomas (Frye). They exhume the body and return to the hospital to prove he was poisoned. Ross awakens from the drug while on the autopsy table. Frye received his highest billing in any of his films for this feature, and performs one of his few non-maniacal roles. He had a more distinguished reputation for his stage work, including Broadway.
