A hero of World War I, Colonel William Duncan (Don Douglas), is on his deathbed. He summons his old friend, Colonel Mitchell Reiker (John Litel) to ask him if he will care for his son Slip (Leo Gorcey) when he dies. Reiker agrees, and when Duncan passes, Slip, who does not want to leave the neighborhood he grew up in, is tricked into attending the military school that Reiker is in charge of. Cadet Major Rollins (Billy Halop) tries to help Slip reform and adapt to military life, but is thrown out a window for his troubles. He continues to have altercations with all of the other cadets, but in the end he winds up saving the life of Cadet Warren (Gabriel Dell) during a fire in the camp munitions storeroom. Although he is seriously injured during the rescue, the other cadets respect his efforts and welcome him as one of their own. For his heroics he is given his fathers distinguished service cross and given the title of cadet major.
