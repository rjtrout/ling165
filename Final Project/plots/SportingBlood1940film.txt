In need of money, Myles Vanders returns to his old Virginia home, once a thriving horse farm that has fallen on hard times. Years have gone by but he still is subject to resentment of the community for Myles father having scandalously run off with neighboring stable owner Davis Lockwoods wife. Myles manages to persuade Lockwood to lend him $3,000 to train and enter his horse Skipper in an upcoming stakes race. Myles must put up his farm as collateral. Lockwood tells his daughters Linda and Joan not to associate with Myles or trust him. Linda says he should be given a fair chance, while Joan attracts a romantic interest from Myles. A fire injures Myless horse and all but ruins his chances for repaying his debt. Things get worse when Joan elopes with a wealthy man while Myles learns a servant of Lockwoods started the fire. A sympathetic Linda offers him her horse, Miss Richmond, to enter in the race. Myles does so, also marrying Linda to incur Lockwoods wrath. She leaves him when she sees this side of Myles, but he comes to his senses, wins her back and wins the race.
