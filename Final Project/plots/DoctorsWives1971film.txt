While playing cards with her girlfriends, all of whom suspect their doctor husbands of having affairs, Lorrie Dellman volunteers to seduce each of them to find out more. The plan backfires when Lorrie is caught in bed with Paul McGill by her husband, brain surgeon Dr. Mort Dellman, who shoots them both. Dr. Pete Brennan is able to save McGills life, but Lorrie is dead. Brennan is fed up with wife Amy and her migraines. He is having an affair with Helen, a nurse. Dr. Dave Randolph is a psychiatrist. His wife, Della, is frigid. Randolph discovers that shes had a lesbian relationship with the late Lorrie. Maggie, an alcoholic, is found face-down in her swimming pool by Dr. Joe Gray, her husband. With all of their lives in turmoil, they attend Lorries funeral, where Helen reveals that her young son needs a brain operation. The doctors agree that Dr. Dellman is the man best suited to do the surgery, but Dellman is in jail for having shot his wife. The district attorney, Douglas, agrees to release the surgeon for a few hours to perform the surgery, under a police guard. He is unaware that Dellman has made a deal with Lorries wealthy father, Jake Porter, to help him flee to Mexico as soon as the operation is done.
