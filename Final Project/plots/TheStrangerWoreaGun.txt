Jeff Travis (Randolph Scott), a former spy for Quantrills Raiders, rides to Arizona to start a new life. Finding that his reputation has preceded him, crooked Jules Mourret (George Macready) hires him to monitor a series of gold shipments, in preparation for a major robbery. Travis falls in love with Shelby Conroy (Joan Weldon), daughter of freight-line operator Jason Conroy (Pierre Watkin), and decides to turn honest.
