Several weeks after the events of the first film, FBI agent Gracie Hart has become a celebrity after she infiltrated the beauty pageant on her last assignment. Her fame resulted in her cover being blown while she is trying to prevent a bank heist. To capitalize on her publicity, the FBI decide to make Gracie the new "face" of the FBI. Hurt after being dumped by her boyfriend, fellow Agent Eric Matthews (who gets relocated to Miami), she agrees to the reassignment. When female FBI Agent Sam Fuller gets relocated to New York City from Chicago, Hart doesnt take to her at all. Eventually, the FBI makes Fuller Harts bodyguard, much to Fullers disgust, since the dislike appears to be mutual. Ten months later she begins appearing on morning television shows, such as Live with Regis and Kelly, The Oprah Winfrey Show and the Food Channel, giving out fashion advice and promoting her book. However, when her friends, Miss United States Cheryl Fraser and Stan Fields are kidnapped in Las Vegas, Hart goes undercover to try to rescue them, accompanied by Fuller, following up her own lead after video footage of the abduction suggests that Fields was the target rather than Cheryl. This puts her at odds with the FBI, as they are unwilling to lose their mascot and are unsure if shes still up to the task. The kidnappers move Cheryl and Stan to the ship at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino which they plan to blow up. Soon afterwards, Hart, Fuller and Joel arrive at the Oasis Drag club where they end up singing Tina Turner songs and are told by a Dolly Parton contestant where Cheryl and Stan are being held. It is then up to Hart to save the day once more, but this time with the help of Agent Fuller.
