Nick and Charlie, a couple of aging thieves looking for a last score before they retire, come to ritzy Palm Beach, Florida, where they have an elaborate scheme to rob a Harry Winston jewelry store. The shop is well guarded and has high-tech security. Its manager, Edward, welcomes an elderly customer seeking an expensive gift for a terminally ill wife. The eager-to-please Edward has no idea that this old gentleman is actually a middle-aged criminal, Nick, in disguise. Dressed as himself, Nick encounters a sophisticated, attractive woman named Carolyn who owns an antique shop next to the jewelry store. He gets better acquainted with her while haggling over a Louis XVI chair that she covets, and before long a romance begins to bloom. An old woman drops by Harry Winston, also interested in making a purchase. She, too, is Nick in disguise. During these visits to the store, Nick is actually casing the joint, making mental notes of the security system in place, with help from Charlie, who is pretending to be a chauffeur. On the night of the robbery, most but not all of Nicks preparations go well. He also didnt count on the participation of Carolyn, who could be convinced to begin a new life in South America with a new partner, as long as he doesnt end up behind bars.
