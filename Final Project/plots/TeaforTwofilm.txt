Set in the Roaring Twenties, the story centers on Nanette Carter (Doris Day), a Westchester socialite with show business aspirations. She offers to invest $25,000 in a Broadway show if her boyfriend, producer Larry Blair (Billy De Wolfe), casts her in the starring role. What she doesnt realize is Larry is two-timing her with ingenue Beatrice Darcy (Patrice Wymore), whom he envisions as the lead. When he accepts Nanettes offer, she imposes upon her wealthy, penny-pinching uncle, J. Maxwell Bloomhaus (S.Z. Sakall), to lend her the money. Hes willing to do so, on one condition - for the next 24 hours, his niece must answer "no" to every question shes asked. Comic complications ensue when the cast arrives at Nanettes estate to rehearse; and composer and pianist Jimmy Smith (Gordon MacRae), who has romantic designs on the girl, falls victim to the bet shes made with her uncle. Nanette wins, only to discover Uncle Max has lost all his money in the stock market crash. The only person still solvent is attorney William Early (Bill Goodwin), and Nanettes assistant Pauline Hastings (Eve Arden) sets out to charm him into backing the show.
