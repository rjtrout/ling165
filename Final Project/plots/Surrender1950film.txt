Johnny is unaware Violet is a bigamist or that Janet was in love with him. Johnnys best friend, gambler Gregg Delaney, had been the object of Violets affections at first before she discovered Johnny was rich. Vaan gets out of jail and tracks Violet down, threatening her with blackmail unless her new husband pays him. Vaan is murdered by Violet, who lets Johnny take the rap. Sheriff Bill Howard places him under arrest. Johnny and Gregg each suspect the other of killing Vaan, not realizing it was Violet all along. Gregg helps spring Johnny from jail, then flees with Violet after she finally confesses to her various sins. Howard and his posse purse the fugitives and kill them both.
