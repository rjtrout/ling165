Tom and Jerry both arrive in Naples, Italy. Tom chases Jerry until an Italian mouse named Topo defends Jerry. Topo explains that he dislikes it when a bigger creature picks on a smaller creature, and proves it by saving Tom from an Italian dog. Topo then recognizes Tom and Jerry and befriends them, showing the duo the sights and treating them to local delicacies. Tom struggles with his large sandwich, making Jerry laugh, but Topo then drops a form of caciocavallo into Jerry, making Jerry inflate. The Italian dog and his two friends follow behind and confront Topo. However, with the help of some very large cheeses, the dogs retreat into the Bay of Naples and Tom, Jerry and Topo emerge victorious. Tom shakes Topos hand and Jerry hugs him before they board a ship for America. As they leave, Topo and the dogs bid them farewell.
