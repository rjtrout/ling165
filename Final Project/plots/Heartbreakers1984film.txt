Two friends in their mid 30s, Blue (Coyote) and Eli (Mancuso), each arrive at crossroads in their lives. Blue is a painter specializing in fetishistic portraits of women, usually selling his images to porn magazines. Elis father wants him to take over the familys undergarment business that has been paying for Elis playboy lifestyle in the fast paced and decedent Los Angeles of the 1980s. Blue is given an opportunity to have his work featured in gallery showing as legitimate art if he can create enough new pieces to fill out a show. His sexy busty model (Carol Wayne) has a crush on Blue, and to please him even appears willing to participate in a threesome including Eli. An ex-flame, Syd (Kathryn Harrold), brings out the jealous worst in Blue now that she is seeing an artist rival of his (Max Gail). Blues self-destructive behavior also puts at risk his relationship with Liliane (Carole Laure), the manager of an art gallery about to exhibit his work.
