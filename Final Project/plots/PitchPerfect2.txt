Three years after winning the previous competition, the Barden Bellas are now led by Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale. The Bellas have become ICCA champions each of these three years. However, the group becomes involved in a national scandal, dubbed Muffgate, when a wardrobe malfunction causes Fat Amys pants to rip in front of President Barack Obama, showing her genitals to the public since she did not wear underwear, leading to the Bellas suspension from the ICCAs. Beca makes a deal to allow the Bellas to be reinstated should they win the World Championship of a cappella. Freshman Emily Junk begins her college career, hoping to follow in her mother Katherines footsteps by being a Bella. At orientation, she watches an a cappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Becas boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Benjamin "Benji" Applebaum, Jesses best friend, overhears Emily, leading to a crush on her. The Bellas learn that Das Sound Machine (DSM), a German powerhouse group, have replaced the Bellas on their victory tour. Additionally, Beca has started an internship at a recording studio, Residual Heat, something only Jesse knows. Emily goes to the Bellas sorority house to audition for them because of their absence from the auditions. When she sings her unfinished song "Flashlight," she succeeds in joining the Bellas. At a car show where the ICCA winners are due to perform, the Bellas scout their replacements, DSM, led by intimidating duo Pieter Kr√§mer and Kommissar, who take delight in mocking the all-girl group. Later, the Bellas are invited to an exclusive riff-off against DSM. Also in attendance are the Treblemakers, Tone Hangers (a group of former Treblemakers, including Bumper), and the Green Bay Packers. The Bellas make it to the final two, but end up losing to DSM in the final round when a nervous Emily flubs an attempt to sing "Flashlight," her original song not from the right category ("90s Hip-Hop Jamz"). The next day at the warmups, the Bellas chances of winning end in disaster when the performance sets Cynthia-Roses hair on fire by pyrotechnics. Even before then, John and Gail question the Bellas identity. In order to regain harmony and sync, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former leader Aubrey Posen. Beca starts a heated debate with Chloe over herself being the only one thinking about life beyond the Bellas and Chloes obsession with winning Worlds. To prove to her boss that she can produce music well, Beca offers Emily to produce "Flashlight" at the studio. The group realizes that they will no longer be together and may go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing "Cups (When Im Gone)." At the studio, Emily and Beca present their song to Becas boss, in which he demonstrates envy for their talent and looks forward to producing with them. The senior Bellas graduate and they all head off to Copenhagen for the World Finals, with Jesse and Benji to cheer them on. They perform a harmonized version of "Flashlight" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. The Bellas win the championship and repair their damaged legacy. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated proper initiation with Fat Amy showing her how to do the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase. In a mid-credits scene, Bumper performs on The Voice, he chooses Christina Aguilera as his coach and makes her uncomfortable when he gives her an oddly lengthy hug.
