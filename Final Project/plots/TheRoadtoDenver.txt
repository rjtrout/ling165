Bill Mayhew is constantly getting his wild younger brother Sam out of trouble, even serving a prison sentence in Sams place once. Because of their reputation, the brothers change names and head their separate ways. Bill lands a job with John Sutton, a livery stable owner, and is attracted to Suttons daughter, Elizabeth. He likes Suttons idea of starting a stagecoach line to Denver, and intends to go along on the stages first journey, guarding a shipment of gold. Sam turns up and is hired by saloonkeeper Jim Donovan, who wants to control all businesses, Suttons included. When he deduces they are brothers, Donovan pretends to hold Sam hostage until Bill brings him the gold. Bill double-crosses him and makes sure the gold is safe. Sam, feeling his brother a fool, demands a showdown. Bill outdraws him, shoots the gun from his hand, then turns his back. Sam finally reforms, even becoming a stagecoach driver for Sutton.
