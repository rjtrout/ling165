Denny OMoore, an Irish lad from New York, has not seen big brother Patrick for eight years. Patrick is said to now own a silver mine in Mexico and sends welcome money to his family in America. In the town of Border City, Texas, a bandit known as "El Tigre" blows up and robs a bank. El Tigre is a dangerous killer with a large gang wanted on both sides of the border. The Mexican Secret Service who have attempted to infiltrate El Tigres gang have had all of their operatives killed or disappeared. Their representative approaches the Texas Rangers with a plan. El Tigres right-hand man is an American, Patrick OMoore. The Mexicans assume that if a Ranger approaches OMoore and gets him back to America he would be willing to betray El Tigre for money and amnesty. Ranger Joe Warder is assigned to go to Mexico and bring OMoore across the border. On the trail, bandits attack Denny but he is saved by Joe. Discovering Dennys brother is the man he is after, Joe teams up with Denny and ride together to San Clemente, Mexico where Patrick resides. Denny discovers a woman there, Carmelita Alvarado, is loved by Patrick but wants nothing to do with him. Denny is seized by El Tigres men, but keeping out of Dennys view, Patrick saves him. Patrick tells the men he has no brother, but orders his men not to harm Danny and return him to the United States unharmed. Patrick later finds Danny and tells him he owes his life to El Tigre, who once saved it. After being held captive, Denny, Joe and Carmelita flee. A friend who helps them escape is killed by El Tigre, who comes at Denny with a machete. Joe shoots him. El Tigre is revealed to be Patrick in disguise. The Americans ride off for home, and Carmelita decides to go along with Denny.
