Monte Wildhorn (Freeman) is a famous Western novelist whose struggle to cope with the death of his wife six years earlier has sapped his passion for writing, and has caused him to begin drinking heavily. He takes a lakeside cabin for the summer in picturesque Belle Isle, and befriends the family next doorâ€”an attractive single mother (Madsen) and her young daughters, who help him find inspiration again.
