Red Adair–type former Navy Frogman Vic Scott is on vacation in Venezuela when a huge oil fire at a well of his rich friend erupts. While romancing a newly-famous novelist from New York a colleague locates him and persuades him to help put out the blaze, just as theirs is starting. More romance than adventure for the first two-thirds of the film, Maracaibo ultimately settles down to dramatic scenes of underwater work to extinguish the fire before a huge storm arrives. The action is interrupted from time to time to explore the romantic angle, including scenes between Abbe Lanes character and Cornel Wildes, who were lovers only a few years prior—though she is now engaged to the rich oil baron. Will her past be revealed? Will the New York author get her man? Will Vic Scott put out the fire near Maracaibo before it reaches the city, then finally settle down?
