Everythings going wrong for Rusty Cameron, a photographer who owns a shop with his pop and grandpop. Rusty owes over $1,000, then loses a camera worth at least that much after borrowing it from another man who suggested Rusty try to take candid pictures of the rich and famous. One of the latter is Lucia Corlane, an heiress with a yacht. She is being swindled by her estates manager, Grantland Farns, and a banker named Shanway, who have business interests in the Lucky Vista housing subdivision. Rusty is asked by Lucia to take pictures of glamorous Miss Lucky Vista for publicity purposes. He ends up in a compromising position with her, making Lucia angry, unaware that the gentlemen betraying her have paid Miss Lucky Vista to seduce the photographer. Rusty has incriminating photos they want back, but the bad guys underestimate him, and Lucia ends up marrying him.
