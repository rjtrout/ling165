In the mid-1870s, outlaws Jesse James, Cole Younger and their brothers are granted amnesty by the Missouri legislature, sympathetic to the troubles created for all citizens by the American Civil War. The bankers, victimized by the James and Younger gangs, are vehemently opposed to amnesty and hire a Pinkerton agent to shadow the outlaws. Younger has put aside plans to rob a bank in Northfield, Minnesota, said to be the largest west of the Mississippi River. The job appeals to Jesse and Frank James, who have no intention of changing the way they make a living. Cole is ambushed by the Pinkertons agents, who use a prostitute as bait. The bankers bribe the politicians to rescind the amnesty. Cole travels by train to Minnesota to check out the bank. Cole learns that the townspeople are concerned about thieves so are unwilling to deposit their money in the bank. Jesse, Frank, and their men arrive on horseback and, together with Cole, persuade the locals that a gold shipment will be kept secured at the bank en route to its destination. The townspeople begin to deposit their money; the robbery commences. Many things go wrong though, including one outlaw being locked inside a vault. Younger and his men flee to a nearby farm, but a posse tracks and apprehends them. The James brothers get away. But, when Jesse mentions to Frank his intention to permit Bob Ford to join the gang back in Missouri, his fate is sealed.
