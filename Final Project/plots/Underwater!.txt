Johnny (Richard Egan) and his wife Theresa (Jane Russell), along with mercenary Dominic Quesada (Gilbert Roland), priest Father Cannon (Robert Keith) and Gloria (Lori Nelson), the boat owner, search for sunken treasure in the Caribbean. While on a dive they come across a wreck that they assume holds treasure. When they resurface they are confronted by a local boat of shark hunters with an unhealthy curiosity in their activities. In their effort to find funding to raise the wreck they discover that what they are looking for is a 17th-century ship that contains a life-size solid gold Madonna encrusted in precious gems and that it lies in a different underwater location. So they make plans to acquire it. However, its on the edge of a precipice in shark-infested waters, and they are not the only ones after it.
