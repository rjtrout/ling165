Carola and Clyde Ballister find a briefcase containing four wills leaving $1-million bequests from an Albert Kingby. They visit the Cleveland home of the first beneficiary, a man named Kempen. They meet his attorney, Jeff Caign, and learn Kempen intended to leave the money to a singer, Lili Roegan. Kempen dies mysteriously, so the Ballisters take a train to go see Professor Ludlow, the next beneficiary. Caign tails them, kills Clyde and becomes the crooked Carolas new partner. The real Kingby turns up. He apparently is part of a neo-Nazi group assisting war criminals. Carola and Caign, now lovers, go to New York City, where they are taken captive by Kingsby and pressured to reveal where the missing wills are. The police close in, kill Kingby but dont charge Carola and Caign, who are free to get on with their sordid lives.
