At Grainbelt University, a Midwestern university, freshman Dobie Gillis (Bobby Van) and his pal Charlie Trask (Bob Fosse) court cute coeds Pansy Hammer (Debbie Reynolds) and Lorna Ellingboe (Barbara Ruick). Pansys wealthy father George (Hanley Stafford) cant stand Dobie and does everything in his power to keep them apart. Along the way, Dobie and Pansy manage to blow up the chemistry lab, while Dobies officious English professor Pomfritt (Hans Conried) is misled to believe that the feckless Gillis is a literary genius.
