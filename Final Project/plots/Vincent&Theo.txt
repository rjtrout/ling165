Vincent & Theo has a prelude, which is documentary footage of the 1987 auction of one of Vincent van Goghs paintings at Christies, a famed London art business. The painting sells for millions of pounds. The film then cuts to scenes that take place in the period from 1883 through 1891, commencing with Vincent van Goghs decision to work exclusively as an artist, and concluding with his death and that of his brother Theo a few months later. The film is a double portrait of both men; Noel Murray has summarised this aspect, "Altman and screenwriter Julian Mitchell contrast Theos life—which mostly consists of him guiding rich people through galleries and selling them paintings he despises—with Vincents gradual development of his own voice and style, through hard physical labor. Vincent & Theo also shows both men as warped by a similar madness, torn between their lusts for sex and alcohol, and their yearnings for social respectability and religious connection." The film portrays several of the better-known episodes of this period of the brothers lives, including Vincent van Goghs move from his brothers apartment in Paris to Provence, Theo van Goghs establishment of an art gallery in Paris and his marriage to Jo Bonger, Vincent van Goghs relationship with the painter Paul Gauguin in Provence, his mutilation of his earlobe, the birth of their son Vincent Willem to Johanna and Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Goghs care by the physician Paul Gachet, and his ultimate suicide.
