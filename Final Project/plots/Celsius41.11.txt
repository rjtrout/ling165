Celsius 41.11 defends Bush against five of the arguments advanced by Fahrenheit 9/11 and additionally criticizes John Kerry, unconvincingly arguing that his opposition to the Vietnam War and his military service in that same war are contradictory positions. The opening images of the film are of the second plane hitting the World Trade Center on September 11. The film then moves to clips of the demonstrations against the war in Iraq, including an interview with an unnamed protester who says she would be happy to live under a dictatorship if the ruler provided universal health care. The next segment shows images of dead children. The film alleges that a feud between the White House and the CIA resulted in Bill Clinton refusing to broker the surrender of Osama bin Laden in 1997. It also contains a list of the terrorist attacks that have occurred since the Iran hostage crisis that one reviewer described as "chilling". Speeches made by John Kerry and running mate John Edwards on the danger posed by the weapons of mass destruction Iraq was accused of possessing are also included.
