The film is set in a fictitious past, in which space travel is pioneered by roughnecks. The logic of space travel is not addressed, and most technology was designed for the film to appear as if "it could be repaired with a hammer". Samuel Curtis, an interplanetary trader, is approached by an acquaintance of his, the Blueberry Pirate, with a mission. He is to provide the women of Venus with a new king for mating. In exchange for this new stud, they will relinquish their currently deceased king, whose family is offering an immense reward for his body. Curtis sets off in search of the perfect replacement, the Boy Who Actually Saw a Womans Breast, and soon discovers that his old nemesis Professor Hess is hot on his trail.
