When a traveling vaudeville show becomes stranded in the Middle East, their singer, Hazel Moon (Marilyn Maxwell), takes a job at a local cafe. Two of the shows prop men, Peter Johnson (Bud Abbott) and Harvey Garvey (Lou Costello), are hired as comedy relief, but their act unfortunately initiates a brawl. The two men, along with Hazel, wind up in jail (where Abbott and Costello perform the famous "Slowly I Turned" routine with a crazy derelict [Murray Leonard] with Pokomoko as the trigger word). They encounter Prince Ramo (John Conte), a sheik, who offers to help them escape if they agree to help him regain the throne that his Uncle Nimativ (Douglass Dumbrille) had usurped with the aid of two hypnotic rings. After escaping jail, Peter and Harvey join Ramo and his desert riders and hatch a plan to have Hazel seduce Nimativ, as he is quite vulnerable to blondes. Once Nimativ is distracted, Peter and Harvey plan to retrieve the hypnotic rings to facilitate Ramos reclamation of the throne. Peter and Harvey enter the capital city, posing as Hollywood talent scouts, and meet up with Nimativ. He is quickly enamored with Hazel and manages to hypnotize Peter and Harvey, who then reveal their plans. They are imprisoned (and encounter once again the derelict, who this time lives through vivid imaginations with clear sound effects from a door, a piano and a broken glass), while Hazel is hypnotized into being one of Nimativs wives. After Ramo helps the boys escape, they enlist the aid of Teema (Lottie Harrison), Nimativs first wife, by promising her a movie career. Harvey then disguises himself as Teema, while Peter dresses up as Nimativ. They manage to steal the rings during a large celebration and turn the rings against Nimativ, who abdicates the throne. Ramo again becomes ruler, with Hazel as his wife, and the boys return to the United States with the derelict as the driver.
