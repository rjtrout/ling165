Con artist Marcus Pendleton has just been released from prison for embezzlement. He has emerged into a world increasingly reliant on computers. He convinces computer programmer Caesar Smith to follow his lifelong dream of hunting moths in the Amazon Rainforest. Assuming Caesars identity, he gains employment at the London offices of an American conglomerate called Tacanco. While Pendleton fools Executive Vice President Carlton Klemperer, another Tacanco executive, Vice President Willard Gnatpole, is suspicious. As Caesar Smith, Pendleton uses the companys computer systems to send claim cheques to himself under various aliases and addresses all over Europe. For his Paris company the cheques go to Claude Debussy; his cheques to Italy go to Gioachino Rossini, both famous composers. He meets and marries Patty, an inept secretary and frustrated flautist. As Caesar, he now has the problem of hiding his hot money. Beating discovery of his fraud by Gnatpole - he and Patty flee to Brazil, and are soon followed by Klemprer and Gnatpool. In a twist it seems that a now heavily pregnant Patty found all of this foreign money and invested it in the same companies that Pendleton created - thus actually making a profit for Tacanco. Patty also explains her desire to have the baby back in England and so contacted Klemprer and Gnatpool to visit. She then persuades Klemprer to rehire Pendleton as Treasurer for Tacanco seeing that it was his genius that created the fraud he be the best one to spot them and that he would not steal from his own company. Pendleton though unhappy with his new legal status agrees. The film ends with Pendleton conducting an orchestra (one of his dreams) and Gnatpole and Klemper as the audience. Patty.. still in advance pregnancy - is the solo flauntist. As she finishes the piece she realizes that the baby is on the way, to which a concerned Pendleton whispers, "What... now?"
