A reclusive foreign-born actress known as Fedora, one of the greatest movie stars of the century, has inexplicably retained her youthful beauty despite her advancing years. She commits suicide by throwing herself in front of a train, and among the mourners at her funeral is aging has-been Hollywood producer Barry "Dutch" Detweiler, with whom she once had a brief affair. Dutch recalls how he had visited Fedora two weeks earlier, at a villa on an island near Corfu, determined to convince her to star in a new screen adaptation of Anna Karenina. She had told him she was a prisoner in her remote retreat, held captive by aged Polish Countess Sobryanski, her overprotective servant Miss Balfour, her chauffeur Kritos, and Dr. Vando, who seemingly was responsible for keeping the one-time star looking so young. When he had tried to respond to Fedoras plea for help, Dutch had been knocked unconscious by Kritos. He had awakened nearly a week later, only to learn Fedora had killed herself. At the funeral, Dutch accuses Vando and the Countess of driving Fedora to her death. The Countess ultimately reveals that in fact she is the real Fedora, and that the woman who died was her daughter Antonia, who had been impersonating the actress for years after one of the doctors treatments disfigured her. Antonias charade was successful until she fell in love with actor Michael York while making a film with him and decided to tell him the truth. In order to ensure her silence, she was held captive and kept drugged, until she finally killed herself. Dutch bids the real Fedora farewell, and six weeks later, she dies too.
