A hulking zombie breaks into a mansion and kills a gangster named Hennesy. The blood stains left behind at the crime scene are radioactive, and the fingerprints of the killer are of a man who had died days before the murder; the police are baffled. Gangster boss Frank Buchanan, who had been forced to flee the United States before he was deported, was betrayed by members of his own underworld gang. While traveling in Europe, he finds ex-Nazi scientist Wilhelm Steigg (Gaye), who is trying to reanimate the dead in order to provide a menial labor pool that is easily exploited. Buchanan funds the research and brings the scientist to America with the unstated goal of sending Steiggs zombies out to murder those who ousted him; one by one, they are killed in the same fashion. The police eventually discover the common connection between the murdered gang members and Buchanan. They try to put the remaining three into protective custody, but Buchanan uses a reanimated dead cop to kill one of them, and a reanimated dead police captain to kill the remaining two. When the zombie captain is captured, police doctor, Dr. Chet Walker (Denning) discovers an atomic-powered remote control brain implant and deduces what has been going on. Police and army troops converge on Buchanans lead-lined mansion, and he sends out his unkillable zombies to battle them. Walker, however, is able to get into the mansion and smash the atomic-powered equipment that controls the zombies; after doing so, they all collapse. Buchanan is about to shoot Walker, but the still-animated zombie police captain, now under Walkers control, grabs and strangles Buchanan before he can fire a shot.
