Junie Moon is a girl whose face is scarred in a vicious battery acid attack by her boyfriend Jesse. Later in an institution, she meets a man with epilepsy, Arthur, and a gay paraplegic who uses a wheelchair, Warren. Disabled, but not down, they live together in an older, rented house and bond, determined to prove themselves and to help each other.
