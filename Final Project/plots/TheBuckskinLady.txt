Drunken Doc Medley (Henry Hull) and his daughter Angie (Patricia Medina) support themselves by Angies gambling skills as her father steers travelers to her card table. Angie is in the romantic thrall of tough guy Slinger (Gerald Mohr), though Slingers rough ways bother her. When her father sells his almost non-existent practice to an unwitting Easterner, Dr. Merritt (Richard Denning), Angie sets out to repay the young doctor. Slinger senses the attraction Angie feels for Merritt and decides to make things difficult for both of them, a decision that leads to robbery and murder.
