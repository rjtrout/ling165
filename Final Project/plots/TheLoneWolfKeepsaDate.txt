After adding a rare Cuban stamp to his coveted collection and admonishing his butler Jamison (Eric Blore) for winning money in a rigged dice game in Havana, retired jewel thief and unofficial private detective Michael Lanyard (Warren William) (a/k/a "The Lone Wolf"), flies off to Miami, meeting gorgeous Patricia Lawrence (Frances Robinson) on board the flying boat. Initially reserved, Lawrence decides to confide in Lanyard about her troubles â€” one of her mail-sender boyfriend Scottys (Bruce Bennett) clients was killed some time ago, after retaining Scotty to send a package stuffed with $100,000 in bank notes. Descending at the Miami airport, they are ambushed by kidnappers Chimp (Edward Gargan), Mr. Lee (Lester Matthews), employees of Big Joe Brady (Don Beddoe). The Lone Wolf swiftly outruns the criminals with Lawrence. He hides the retrieved stack of money in a hotel safe, but hes is discovered by Inspector Crane (Thurston Hall) and his annoyingly buffoonish assistant Detective Sergeant Wesley Dickens (Fred Kelsey), along with goofy Miami police Captain Moon (Jed Prouty). Lanyard evades capture and sets out to expose the three villains on his own. The detective also realizes that his prized stamp collection has also been swiped by Big Joe Brady. He manages to track them down and has the police arrest them. After myriad chases, double-crosses and switches, The Lone Wolf exonerates himself and mulls over missing an important philatelists convention with his finally retrieved prize collection.
