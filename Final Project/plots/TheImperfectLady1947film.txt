In 1892, showgirls Millie and Rose have a chance encounter with Clive Loring, a politician who invites them to tea. Millie falls for Clive and vows to give up the stage, but his brother Lord Belmont nevertheless disapproves. Going out in public in stage makeup, Millie and Rose are mistaken for prostitutes. And a man Millie spends a few innocent hours with, Jose Martinez, is arrested for a murder. His only chance of being proven innocent is if Millie will provide an alibi, but she denies knowing him, fearing it will reflect poorly on Clive. Lord Belmonts suspicions are confirmed when he attends the trial. Martinez is convicted, but its obvious he was telling the truth in identifying Millie as the woman hed been with at the time. Millie is coerced into testifying as a public outcry begins for Clive to resign from Parliament. But despite the uproar, Clive decides to remain true to his love.
