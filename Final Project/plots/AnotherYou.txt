George, a former mental patient and pathological liar, is released from the hospital. He is quickly, purposefully mistaken for millionaire brewery heir Abe Fielding by a troupe of actors hired by Rupert Dibbs, an unscrupulous business manager. Rupert needs George to believe he is Fielding in order to kill him off and inherit the Fielding Brewery and family fortune. Eddie Dash, a con man, tenuously befriends George due to a community service assignment. He attempts at first to capitalize on Georges mistaken identity, but after being pressured by Rupert into killing George for profit, turns the tables on Rupert and helps George fake his death, only to come back to the land of the living and inheriting both the brewery and the Fielding fortune instead. Along the way, Eddie and George turn two of Ruperts female associates into allies and partners, while getting themselves into plenty of comical chaos.
