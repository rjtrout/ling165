Vincent has trained to be a minister, like his father, but the church authorities find him unsuitable. He pleads with them to be allowed some position and they place him in a very poor mining community. Here he becomes deeply absorbed in the daily poverty and begins sketching daily life. The apostate religious leaders do not like his approach, and they frown on his social activism and care for the poor. He returns home to his fathers house. Here a woman he obsessively loves (his cousin) rejects Van Gogh because of his inability to support himself financially. The infatuated Vincent follows her to her family home, where he holds his hand over a candle flame to prove his devotion, only to learn that she has said she is disgusted by him and doesnt want to see him again. A friend gives him paint and artist materials and encourages him to paint, and he heads to Paris. Here he takes up with a prostitute who eventually also leaves because he is too poor. His passion then turns fully to painting, which he pursues while agonizing that his vision exceeds his ability to execute. His brother, Theo van Gogh, provides financial and moral support. Paul Gauguin (whom he met in Paris) joins him in Arles, and for a while life is good, but Vincent is too obsessive even for Gauguins tastes and they argue, after which Vincent cuts off his own ear. Vincent begins experiencing hallucinations and seizures and voluntarily commits himself to a mental institution. He signs himself out, and with Theos help returns to a rural area to resume painting. Out painting cornfields he is frustrated by the crows and ultimately shoots himself in despair of never being able to put what he sees on canvas. As a result, he dies a few days after shooting himself.
