Newlyweds Ted (Kirk) and Margie Hastings (Helm) go on honeymoon at the hotel of Margies uncle, Jacques Phillipe (Bergerac). Nervous about the prospect of having sex, Margie picks up a copy of Mother Goose and begins reading from it, causing Ted to faint. Dr. Richards (DHondt), a psychiatrist, deduces that Ted has a "Mother Goose complex" and treats him with an LSD spray while he sleeps. This causes him to hallucinate and mix up reality with fairy tales.
