The video combines footage from the early years of the Grateful Dead with 1997 interviews of former band members and associates. Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bob Weir, Robert Hunter, and David Grisman, among others, discuss the creation of 1968s experimental, psychedelic Anthem of the Sun and 1970s folk-rock classic American Beauty. They also listen to and analyze the original master recordings for the albums, and talk about being in (or working with) the Grateful Dead at that time. Recording engineer Stephen Barncard rolls the original master tape and solos tracks, recalling the recording sessions and highlighting specific moments. Keyboardist Tom Constanten discusses the artificiality of appearing on Hugh Hefners show Playboy After Dark. David Grisman plays his full version of the mandolin part for Ripple, as he had intended.
