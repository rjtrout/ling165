In the film, Rosss character, named Pauline Cooper, is a former medical student who becomes ill with paranoid schizophrenia and loses 18 years of her life due to the sickness. After her release from a mental ward, Pauline struggles to rebuild her life with help from doctors, nurses, and a new experimental medication that will help aid her back to health. Throughout the movie, Pauline seeks to better herself in a world that she felt had shunned her. The story is open-ended, concluding with Pauline seeing a homeless woman rummaging through junk cans and talking to herself, which leaves her (Pauline) in tears. The question of whether this will be Paulines future or was a fate Pauline had avoided but to which she could still fall victim was not answered, only raised.
