Lieutenant Fred OConnor (Keitel) and his partner, police officer Bob Carvo (Mann), are a pair of corrupt cops who have spent their illegal earnings on an uptown New York City flat. A friction starts between them, as Carvo feels guilty about their scams and wants to abandon their association. Meanwhile, the police force of the city is trying to catch a serial killer who has chosen corrupt policemen as targets. The man, who has been nicknamed "Cop Killer" by the press, has apparently been watching OConnors every movement. A very disturbed youngster called Leo Smith (Lydon) arrives at OConnors door and convinces him that hes the notorious "copkiller" and is responsible for a continued killing spree. OConnor beats, subdues and kidnaps Smith and starts to think how to murder him, but when Carvo appears and finds out about Smith, the partners have a struggle and OConnor accidentally kills Carvo instead. He decides to make Smith his accomplice in the crime, and after that Smith becomes a permanent "guest" of OConnor, trapped inside but living freely in OConnors apartment, with no indication of a change in the strange situation. OConnor starts to feel the guilt over his actions, while at the same time he gets closer to Carvos widow, Lenore (Garcia), shifting from interested friend to romantic interest. A bizarre cat-and-mouse game develops between OConnor and Smith, with the first trying to direct the course of OConnors actions to prevent any more inquiries on Carvos death, and the latter investigating if his enigmatic cohabitant is the real cop killer. The mind game contorts until the one-upmanship reaches a climactic end.
