Two families in rural Tennessee, headed by patriarchs Laban Feather (Rod Steiger) and Pap Gutshall (Robert Ryan) are at odds with each other. The sons of the two families play harmless tricks on each other but soon the Feather boys decide to kidnap a girl, escalating the rivalry. She turns out to be innocent bystander Roonie Gill (Season Hubley), not the made-up girlfriend "Lolly Madonna." As events escalate, Zack Feather (Jeff Bridges) and Roonie fall in love and try to bring the others to their senses. The two families kill one another, until only the patriarchs are left.
