Bored with her life and with Don, her lawyer boyfriend, waitress Ellen Ward craves excitement. She accepts an invitation from Ritchie and Mike, a couple of petty crooks, and ends up giving them an alibi for a crime. Ritchie rewards her with $100. Ellen catches the eye racketeer Charles Blake, irking his moll Vivian, who attacks her with a pair of scissors. Ellen shoots her in self-defense. Ellen is badly injured and has her face radically altered by plastic surgery. Don becomes an assistant district attorney and helps an investigation into Blakes activities, with Ellen, no longer recognizable, working undercover. Blake is about to shoot Don when, at the last instant, Ellen steps between them and is killed.
