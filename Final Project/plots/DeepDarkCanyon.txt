Nate (Spencer Treat Clark) and Skylar (Nick Eversman), sons of sheriff Bloom Towne (Ted Levine), are involved in the accidental death of Mayor Cavanaughs son Dick in a hunting accident. Older brother Nate fired the deadly shot, but to protect him, younger Skylar, still a minor, takes the blame. Owning most of the towns businesses, the Cavanaugh family itself is wealthy and influential. In retaliation, the family uses their influence to have Skylar set to be tried as an adult, rather than as a minor. Desperate and filled with guilt, Nate breaks Skylar out of the county lock-up and, handcuffed together, the two escape into the local woods. Two deputies are killed in the escape and the Cavanaugh clan, deciding that the sheriff will be unable to act impartially, organize themselves into a search team with orders to shoot on sight. Sheriff Towne joins the search efforts in order to reach his sons before they are shot by others. He is forced to measure the major political debt he owes to the Mayor and the Cavanaugh family, against his oath to uphold the law and the love he has for his two sons.
