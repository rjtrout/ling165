While the Stooges are trying to apply new horseshoes to their horses, they accidentally fall through the floor where they find the Princess bound and gagged. The Magician meanwhile gets the Kings agreement that if he can recover the Princess he can marry her.

Shemp frees the Princess, but he and the others are captured. However the guards are distracted when the magicians assistant walks past, following her. The Stooges escape up the rope ladder into the box, which Murgatroyd is sawing through and then sticking swords into, hurting the Stooges. Finally the box breaks and the Stooges fall out, just before Alicia runs in and tells her father who abducted her.
