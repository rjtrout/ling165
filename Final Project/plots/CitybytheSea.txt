Vincent LaMarca (Robert De Niro) is a veteran New York City Police Department detective, whose criminal father had been executed for murder, after a child whom he had kidnapped was killed. Vincent has had to live with this stigma hanging over his own reputation, and history begins to repeat itself when his own son, Joey LaMarca (James Franco), a junkie, becomes involved in a drug-related killing. Joey suddenly comes to the attention of Vincents current girlfriend, Michelle (Frances McDormand), who was unaware that he even had a son, and she can not understand why Vincent is unwilling to help him. Joeys girlfriend Gina (Eliza Dushku), who is struggling to stay sober for their infant son Angelo, comes into Vincents life, asking him to save Joey. She later abandons the child, leaving him with Vincent. Joey gets deeper into trouble when the local drug enforcer, Spyder (William Forsythe), kills Vincents cop partner Reg (George Dzundza). Reg had been helping Vincent to clear Joeys name, but Joey is blamed for his murder. As his fellow police officers search for Joey as a suspected "cop killer," Vincent decides to set aside his self-imposed isolation, and to help save his sons life.
