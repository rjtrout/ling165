The 16-year-old amateur photographer Charles (Jon Cryer) accidentally takes a photo of Laura (Demi Moore), and falls in love with her when he develops the picture. He finds out that she works as a singer in a bar, but is about to be thrown out. Although rejected at first by the 22-year-old, he attempts to boost her performing career by starting an ad campaign behind her back â€” with unexpected results.
