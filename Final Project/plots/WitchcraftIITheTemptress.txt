About 18 years after the first films ending, William Adams (who in later movies changes his last name to Spanner), the child from the first movie, is living with his adopted parents and assumes he is a normal 18 year old. He is unaware of his adoption or of his role in the first movie. Williamss adoptive parents stole him away from the coven in the previous film, as they are white witches who did not agree with the aims of their coven. They have hidden William in the suburbs to protect him from evil. His neighbor, Deloris, (created by the mother in law witch from the first film), leaves William a strange object in an attempt to get William to join the dark side. Unknown to William, he is the son of a powerful warlock and has inherited his fathers powers. The father and many of his paternal relatives are members of a coven who have spent years attempting to bring about the end of the world. Deloriss ultimate goal is to and have William father her child, who will bring about hell on earth. At the last possible moment, Spanner is able to defeat the witch and resist evil
