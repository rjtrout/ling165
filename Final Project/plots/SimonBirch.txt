Simon Birch believes that God made him for a special, heroic purpose. Simon and his best friend, Joe Wenteworth, are both outcasts in their tiny New England town. Joe is the illegitimate son of the town beauty, and Simon, at age 12, is so small that he still plays the infant Jesus in the church Christmas pageant. In the summer of 1964, their friendship is put to the test when, during a Little League game, Simon hits a foul ball that strikes and kills Joes mother. Together, they try to find out who Joes father is. Just as they succeed, the time comes for Simon to fulfill the destiny he believes in. A situation arises that demands a heroâ€”a very small hero. While Simon and Joe are riding a school bus, the bus crashes into a lake. The two boys get everyone out of the bus, but Simon nearly drowns. While the two friends are in the hospital, Joe visits Simon, who later dies due to the injuries he sustained during the bus rescue. Joe remarks that he will always remember Simon for the hero that he was.
