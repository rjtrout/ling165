A physicians death orphans his two adolescent daughters. Their older brother is able to convert some of the doctors small estate to cash. It is late in the day, and with the banks closed he stores the money in his fathers household safe. The slatternly housekeeper, aware of the money, enlists a criminal acquaintance to help crack the safe. They lock the daughters in an adjacent room, and the drunken housekeeper menaces them by brandishing a gun through a hole in the wall. The resourceful girls use the telephone to call their brother who has returned to town. He gets the message and organizes a rescue party.
