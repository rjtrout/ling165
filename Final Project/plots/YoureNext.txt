Eric Harson and his girlfriend Talia finish having sex. After taking a shower, Eric finds Talia’s corpse and “You’re Next” written in her blood. Eric is then attacked and killed by Lamb Mask with a machete. Later, a woman named Erin accompanies her boyfriend, Crispian Davison to his family reunion at their rural Missouri vacation home. Present are Crispians parents Aubrey and Paul, Drake (Crispians older brother) and Kelly (Drakes wife), younger Davison siblings Felix and Aimee, Zee (Felixs girlfriend) and Tariq (Aimees boyfriend). During a dinner argument, crossbow bolts are shot through the window, hitting and killing Tariq and wounding Drake. With their cell phone signals jammed by the attackers, Aimee runs out the front door to get help, but runs into a garrote wire which slices her throat. She quickly dies from blood loss. Crispian leaves the house to find help. Paul brings Aubrey to her bedroom upstairs; when Paul leaves, Fox Mask appears from under the bed with the machete and kills Aubrey. The rest of the family rushes upstairs to find Aubrey dead with the words "Youre next" scrawled on the wall in blood and the machete stuck in her face. Erin texts 911 and begins finding objects that can be used as weapons. She encounters Tiger Mask and evades his attack, wounding him in the process. Kelly returns to the bedroom and discovers Fox Mask still hiding under the bed; she panics and runs to the neighboring home. After pounding on the window for help, she gets inside but discovers the murdered couple who were killed at the beginning of the film, and is killed by Lamb Mask. Back at the house, Tiger Mask fails to kill Erin and is in turn killed by her with a meat tenderizer. Lamb Mask finds Drake, but Erin stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats. While exploring the house, Paul finds evidence that the killers had been staying in the house for some time. He tries to tell Zee and Felix, but Fox Mask slits his throat, killing him. It is revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins to murder the family and collect their inheritance. Felix is an aggressive killer and he hates his family who are so abusive to him. So with the help of Zee, another aggressive killer, the two hire three killers, Tom (Fox Mask), Craig (Lamb Mask), and Dave (Tiger Mask) to destroy the family. The assassins agree. Meanwhile, Erin (still unaware of Felix and Zees scheme) and Zee set up traps together; Erin explains that she grew up on a survivalist compound where she learned her combat and survival skills. Zee is about to attempt to kill Erin, but is interrupted. Felix lures Drake to the basement and fatally stabs him with several screwdrivers. Erin overhears an argument between Felix, Zee, Fox Mask and Lamb Mask. Realizing their plans, she escapes from the house, injuring her leg in the process. Erin doubles back to the house and kills Lamb Mask by stabbing him in the head with a screwdriver. Realizing she cannot outrun the remaining killer with a wounded leg, Erin sets up a trap at the front door. Fox Mask, however, enters the house through a window, so she sets up an ambush in the basement and kills him with a log. With their hired assassins dead, Zee and Felix attempt to kill Erin themselves, but she brutally kills them both, sticking a live blender onto Felixs head and stabbing Zee through the head. Crispian calls Felixs phone, and when Erin picks up the call, he inadvertently reveals his involvement in the scheme. Crispian returns to the house and, ignoring his attempts to bribe her with money, Erin fatally stabs him in the neck and eye. A policeman arrives and shoots Erin in the shoulder, having seen her kill Crispian. After calling for backup, he attempts to enter the house but is accidentally killed by Erins front door trap that was intended for Fox Mask.
