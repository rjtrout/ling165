Susan Miller (Gene Tierney) works as a girdle salesgirl in a big department store. She dreams of living on "the other side", among the rich. An elderly woman, calling herself Mrs. Maybelle Worthington (Spring Byington), comes to buy some underwear. She is actually a professional swindler. Her partner Warren (Laird Cregar) meets her at the department store, and reports that her "daughter" (a partner in their schemes) has run away to get married. They notice that Susan resembles the "daughter", and ask her to impersonate the missing girl at their party that evening. Susan sees an opportunity to experience life among the rich, and wear the expensive clothes she could never afford. From that day on, Susan becomes "Linda Worthington" and accompanies "Mother Worthington" and "Uncle Warren" in their travels. They use her to attract marriageable young rich men, whom they swindle. One day in Southern California, they encounter John Wheeler (Henry Fonda), and overhear his plan to buy a yacht for $15,000. They take him for a millionaire, and use "Linda" to lure him into one of their swindles. But John is actually an accountant, who has carefully saved the $15,000 out of his limited income. This time Susan/Linda falls in love with the intended victim, and its hard for them to find their way to happiness.
