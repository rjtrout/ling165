In 1845, trader Oliver Hale and his new wife are returning from New York to California. In a New Orleans music hall they meet and befriend an entertainer who uses the stage name of Florinda Grove. The dance hall singer is actually on the run from the New York police since shes wanted for a murder she claims to be innocent of. The Hales believe her story and help her escape the city under the guise of a widow bound for St. Louis on a riverboat. The newlyweds themselves reach New Mexico where they plan to join a wagon train bound for California. In Santa Fe, the Hales bump into entertainer Florinda again. While Oliver Hale is away on a short business trip, a messenger from his brother Charles Hale arrives in town, bringing a special letter from Charles. In the letter, Charles explains that Carmelita Velasco, the daughter of a wealthy landowner, claims to be pregnant with Olivers child and that she and her family expect Oliver to do the right honorable thing and marry her. But, alas, the letter reaches Oliver too late since hes now already married to New Yorker Garnet. By refusing to marry Carmelita, Oliver risks offending the whole Velasco family. To make matters worse, the dowry of Carmelita Velasco consists of a large Spanish land tract that Charles Hale covets. Days later, Oliver Hale, his wife Garnet and their new friend Florinda join a wagon train destined for Los Angeles. How will Oliver get out of this tight spot and conciliate his family with the Velasco family while preserving their honor?
