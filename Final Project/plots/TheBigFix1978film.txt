A former 1960s student activist turned private detective searches for a missing Berkeley activist with whom he shared "the barricades." Former campus activist turned private investigator Moses Wine is contacted by Lila, an old girlfriend from his radical college days. She wants him to work for Miles Hawthorne, who is a candidate running for governor of California. Moses is told about a flyer being distributed around the state; this bears a doctored photo of Hawthorne standing beside a 1960s radical named Howard Eppis, who had been convicted in absentia for inciting violence against the government and has been living as a fugitive since, libelously claiming that Eppis is supporting Hawthorne for governor in a clear attempt to destroy Hawthornes chances for being elected. Moses sets out to find out who is responsibleâ€”with deadly results.
