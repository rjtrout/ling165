The story line primarily follows three American students as they feel their ways through a year of studies at The Institute in Paris: Laura (Blanche Baker), who ostensibly narrates the goings-on of the film with the postcards she sends to her boyfriend back home; Alex (David Marshall Grant), whose interests arent so much in studying but with love and life in Paris; and Joel (Miles Chapin), who cant quite seem to live with the courage of his convictions. Alex becomes ensnared in a tryst with his instructor (and the Institutes co-director Madam Tessier (Marie-France Pisier), while Joel falls in love with a local bookstore employee, Toni (Val√©rie Quennessen). Real American students were used as extras in the movie.
