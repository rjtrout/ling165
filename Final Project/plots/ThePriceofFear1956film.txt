David Barrett, the co-owner of a dog-track, discovers that his partner has sold out to gangster Frankie Edare (Stevens) who plans to take sole control of the track and wants to get rid of Barrett. His problems are just beginning, though, as he finds himself involved with Jessica Warren who, unknown to him, was involved in a hit-and-run accident and is trying to set him up for the crime. When Edare kills Barretts ex-partner to frame him, Barret is falsely accused of committing two murders. Mayhem ensues when the police arrest him, but justice eventually prevails.
