Jarhead recounts Swoffords enlistment and service in the United States Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War, in which he served as a Scout Sniper with the Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) Platoon of 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines. Like most of the troops stationed in the Middle East during the Gulf War, Swofford saw very little actual combat. Swoffords narrative focuses on the physical, mental and emotional struggles of the young Marines. One of the through-lines of his first-person account involves the challenge of balancing the art and science and mind-set of the warrior with ones own basic sense of humanity. Swofford admits to a sense of disappointment, frustration and emptiness that comes in the wake of ultimately being cheated of any real combat experience by a war that, for many American Marines at least, has ended all too quickly after enduring many months of grinding, anticlimactic suspense. And yet there have been the numerous encounters with poignant, eerie tableaux of dead Iraqi soldiers whod been killed so quickly where they sat so as to appear to have been deliberately posed, like store-display mannequins, in their final moments of life.
