The opening credits scroll over an animated image of the character Bambi serenely grazing while the Call to the Dairy Cows from Rossinis opera William Tell (1829) plays in the background. After the credits, Bambi looks up to see Godzillas giant foot coming down, squashing him flat (set to the final chord of The Beatles "A Day in the Life" slowed down to half speed). After a moment, the closing credits appaer next to the image of Godzillas foot on top of a squished Bambi. At the very end, Godzillas claws twitch once. The bulk of the movies running time is consumed in the opening credits, all of which name Marv Newland, including crediting Newlands parents for creating Marv. The closing credits give grateful acknowledgement to the city of Tokyo "for their help in obtaining Godzilla for this film".
