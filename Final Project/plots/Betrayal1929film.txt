Swiss peasant girl Vroni (Esther Ralston) is having a secret summer romance with Viennese artist Andre Frey (Gary Cooper). When Andre later returns to Switzerland, he learns that Vroni has been forced to marry wealthy burgomeister Poldi Moser (Emil Jannings). Explaining Andres appearance, Vroni introduces him as a young man who has just lost his sweetheart, and in sympathy, Poldi invites Andre to be a guest in his house. Several times over the next few years Andre visits, during which time Poldi and Vroni have two children. Andre is overwrought by his repressed feelings toward Vroni, and after seven years, begs her to run off with him. She refuses, but agrees to one last tryst. While speeding down a dangerous run on a toboggan together, Vroni is killed and Andre fatally injured. Poldi learns the truth of the relationship while attending Vronis funeral, and swears vengeance but discovers that Andre has died from the severity of his injuries.
