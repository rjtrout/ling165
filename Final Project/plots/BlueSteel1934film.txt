Wayne plays John Carruthers, an undercover US Marshal, but that is not disclosed until well into the film. He appears to be in town investigating a string of robberies committed by the Polka Dot Bandit (Yakima Canutt), but when hes a little late in discovering one of the Bandits latest thefts, Sheriff Jake (George "Gabby" Hayes) thinks hes the thief. For some reason, instead of arresting him, Jake accompanies him on his journey; after all, as Wayne says, "Its kind of lonesome trailing alone." The two stumble upon a gang robbing a pack-mule train; they rescue Betty Mason (Eleanor Hunt), whose father has just been killed by the bandits. She and her father were bringing desperately needed provisions to town, but the bandits have successfully cut off any supplies, forcing the townspeople to consider fleeing their homes or starving to death. It turns out that the local rich man, with the meaningful name of Malgrove (Edward Peil Sr.), is behind the robberies. He knows theres a vein of gold underneath the homesteaders property, and he offers out of the kindness of his heart to purchase their land for a pittance. B-movie bad guys have a tendency to crow about their evil plans without checking to see if anyone is hiding nearby, and when the grieving Betty overhears his plans, Malgrove and his henchmen kidnap her. Carruthers and Jake offer to make one last attempt to bring supplies in, and Malgrove and his henchmen make plans to murder them.
