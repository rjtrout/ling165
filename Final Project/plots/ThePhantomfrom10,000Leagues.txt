A mysterious, man-sized monster kills a fisherman at sea. Biologist Ted Baxter (Kent Taylor) finds the body on the beach, along with Federal Agent William Grant (Rodney Bell), and they decide to investigate the death. Ted eventually discovers that Dr. King (Michael Whalen), another marine biologist, created the monster and the radioactive rock with a mutating device in his laboratory. Meanwhile, foreign agents try to discover Dr. Kings secrets, while Ted and Kings daughter (Cathy Downs) develop a relationship. Agent Grant captures the foreign agents, while Ted finally tells Dr. King the monster is killing people and must be stopped. When King witnesses a ship explode as it passes over the rock, he realizes Ted is right, destroys his lab and goes to kill his creation using dynamite. Shortly before a timed detonation, the monster grabs him. Ted arrives just in time to witness the explosion, which destroys the rock, the monster, and Dr. King.
