During a weekend excursion in the woods, three friends, Victor (Ellar Coltrane), his ex-girlfriend Lynn (Willa Fitzgerald) and Jeff (Jacob Artist), whos secretly sleeping with Lynn, discover four bags full of money. They discover that it belongs to a criminal named Miller (John Cusack), who is looking for it. During their getaway, Jeff is entangled with one of the bags of money. With Miller pulling him in one direction, and Lynn refusing to let go of the money, Jeff dies. During the finale, Victor falls and Lynn has hid the money in an abandoned mill. Miller confronts Lynn at the mill and Lynn tries to negotiate with him, saying that if he gives her some of the money, she will tell him where the rest is hidden. Lynn distracts Miller long enough for Victor to hit him from behind with a pipe. Lynn grabs the pipe and begins hitting Miller multiple times in the head, killing him. Lynn grabs Millers gun and points it at Victor. She tells him that she is sorry, before she pulls the trigger, killing him. The final shot of the film is Lynn, walking out of the mill, dragging the money back to civilization.
