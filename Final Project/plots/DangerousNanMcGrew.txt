Helen Kane takes the lead role as an entertainer in a traveling medicine show run by her boss. Muldoon, one of the members of the medicine show, is a fugitive who is on the run from a murder charge. Its up to Dangerous Nan McGrew, the Sharpshooting singer, to save the day. The medicine show gets stranded at the snowbound hunting lodge of a wealthy woman. Performing at a Christmas Eve show for the lodge guests, the saxophone-playing nephew of the landlady falls in love with Nan. Enter the villain, a bank robber (how did he get through the snow?). Can the Royal Canadian Mounted Police be far behind? You betcha!
