Crumb is about the experiences and characters of Robert Crumb and his family, particularly his brothers, Maxon and Charles, as well as Roberts wife Aline Kominsky-Crumb and his children. (Crumbs sisters declined to be interviewed.) The movie chronicles Crumbs career, highlighting his creations "Keep On Truckin" and Fritz the Cat, and his pioneering role in the genesis of underground comix. Interviews with his family members and ex-girlfriends (such as Kathy Goodell), and commentary from critics like Robert Hughes and Trina Robbins, as well as selections from Crumbs vast artist output, shed light on Crumbs psychology and darkly cynical perspective on life. Portraits emerge as well of older brother Charles, who committed suicide before the film was released, and youngest brother Maxon, a panhandler who painted to assuage his inner demons. Though filmmaker Zwigoff had the consent of the Crumb brothers, some questioned the ability of the more disturbed brothers to provide that consent. The involvement of Charles and Maxon, which Zwigoff felt was just as important to Roberts story as anything else, led Zwigoff to title the film Crumb to imply the importance of all three brothers.
