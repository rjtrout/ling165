Constructed as a series of chapters that take place at a turning point in each characters life, the story moves from seven years in the past to three years to two and finally arrives in the present day. Emily Friehl (Amanda Peet) and Oliver Martins (Ashton Kutcher) first encounter is on a flight from Los Angeles to New York City. He has hopes of becoming an Internet entrepreneur and, certain of his future success, gives her his mothers phone number and suggests she call him in six years to see if his prediction came true. Three years later, facing the prospect of spending New Years Eve alone, Emily finds Olivers number and calls him, and the two meet for dinner. Thus starts a series of reunions with the passing of time, as each drifts in and out of relationships with others, Oliver and his business partner Jeeter start an on-line diaper service, and Emily becomes a successful photographer. Each time they meet, one appears to be settled and content while the other is struggling to make headway in both life and career. Eventually they come to the realization that each is exactly the person the other one needs for fulfillment.
