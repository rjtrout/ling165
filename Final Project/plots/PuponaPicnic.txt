Spike and Tyke are enjoying a picnic, but a chase between Tom and Jerry forces them to set out on another picnic, where they resolve to keep Tom away once and for all. Jerry, hiding in their picnic basket, draws a likeness of himself onto a hot dog to trick Tom into taking food from their basket, which angers Spike; however, Tom evades Spike by tricking him to lunge for a hot dog, where Spike crashes into a shallow lake; which is where he is knocking his head and a word inside a pink circle which reads sucker. Jerry then leaves the basket and hides behind mushrooms, but is found by Tom, causing Jerry to jump into Tykes sandwich. Tom chases Jerry, but Jerry jumps into Spikes hands, causing Tom to flee, before jumping into the basket to make Tom flee from Spike again. Spike then picks up a sandwich Jerry is hiding in and gives it to Tyke, but Jerry jumps back into the basket and throws the sandwich away. Jerry then spots Tom disguising himself as a bush. Tom reaches to grab Jerry, but grabs a tomato, after which Jerry throws a tomato at Spike to give Tom away, causing Spike to chase Tom. Tom searches the basket for Jerry, but on the third search, Tom is bitten by Spike, who hid inside. Tom sprays pepper at Spike, but Spike then sneezes at Tom, launching Tom into a wire fence. Tom is sprung back to Spike and grabs the basket in middair, but crashes into a tree, which splits before squashing Tom, leaving his feet sticking out. Jerry runs back to Spike and Tyke, using the basket as cover. Spike guards the basket, but Tom, perched in an apple tree, attempts to catch Jerry with a fishing rod, only to catch food instead. Meanwhile, an army of hungry ants see the food Tom has caught, and crawl their way there. Tom finally catches Jerry, but the weight of the ants crawling causes Tom to fall from the tree. Spike, Tom and Tyke then see the food being taken away by the ants, with Jerry being carried inside a sandwich along with them.
