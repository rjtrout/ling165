Newly transferred college student Lily becomes friends with Violet, Heather and Rose, a clique who run the campus suicide prevention centre. Over the course of the film, the four girls date less attractive men in order to help the mens confidence; they try to clean up the "unhygenic" Doar Dorm; they clash with the editor of the campus newspaper The Daily Complainer who wants to close down the "elitist" Roman letters fraternities; and finally they try and start a new dance craze, called The Sambola!
