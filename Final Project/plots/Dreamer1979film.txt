A young man dreams and struggles to become a championship bowler, knowing that determination and sacrifice must come first. Tim Matheson is the Dreamer in this story which many saw as heavily inspired by Rocky. "Dreamer" is a ten-pin whiz in his small town of Alton IL, but wants to make it in the big time on the professional tour. Ultimately, he does, with the help of irascible manager Harry (Jack Warden) and faithful girlfriend Karen (Susan Blakely). As if to underline the resemblances between Dreamer and its cinematic role model, the musical score is by Rockys Bill Conti. Bowling legend Dick Weber appears at the movies end as Johnny Watkin.
