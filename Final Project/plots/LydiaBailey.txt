Albion Hamlin, a farmer and lawyer from Maine, defends a Boston publisher from prosecution under the Alien and Sedition Acts and falls in love with his daughter Lydia after seeing a painting of her. He looks for her in revolution-torn Haiti, where Toussaint Louverture tries to gain power. The couple eventually become involved in the American action against the Barbary pirates.
