Private investigator Jerry Church (Knowles) has just married his longtime fiance, Kit (Gwynne). Defense attorney Dudley Crispin (Hinds) and Churchs former police partner Capt. Hurd (Edmund McDonald), talk Church into taking one last case: investigating a string of murders committed by someone calling themself Dr. Rx where the victims have been five clients that Crispin had successfully defended in court. After a sixth murder and the discovery that another detective has gone insane investigating the murders, Church agrees to drop the case at Kits insistence. However, he is kidnapped and blackmailed into continuing the investigation by a criminal who the police suspect is the killer but who wants his name cleared by Church finding the real Dr. Rx. Church is then abducted by Dr. Rx who explains that he is going to transplant Churchs brain into a gorilla (Corrigan) to make the gorilla smart, leaving Church in the cage with the angry gorilla. Church is found the next morning and taken, unconscious, to the hospital where everyone gathers around, including Dr. Fish (Atwill) who has been seen following Church. When the District Attorney (William Gould) asks to use Crispins pen, Crispin takes the pen, which is actually a poison dart gun, and shoots himself in the chest and dies. Church reveals that he has just been faking unconsciousness, and that he had been working with Dr. Fish to capture Crispin who had wanted to prove himself brilliant by defending criminals in court, but then reestablishing justice by killing the guilty men after their trials.
