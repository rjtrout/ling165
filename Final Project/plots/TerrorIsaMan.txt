William Fitzgerald (Richard Derr), the lone survivor of a shipwreck, washes ashore on Blood Island. He is later found by Dr. Charles Girard (Francis Lederer), a scientist who has set up a laboratory on the island with his wife, Frances Girard (Greta Thyssen), and assistant Walter Perrera (Oscar Keesee). The islands natives are scared of Dr. Girard, due to his strange ideas about the link between man and animals, and leave the island. The doctor has experimented on a panther, changing it into a half-man/half-panther beast which regularly escapes and kills villagers. As time passes on the island, Fitzgerald and Frances eventually fall in love. The creature manages free itself from its confines once again and goes on a rampage, killing Walter and abducting Frances. With William and Charles in hot pursuit, the creature is eventually cornered on the edge of a cliff where it hurls Charles to his death. Before the creature can turn on the others, it is shot by William. Fleeing towards the beach, the creature is helped by a sympathetic young native, Tiago, and drifts out to sea in a small boat.
