James Parker (C. Aubrey Smith) and Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) travel in Africa, Algeria on a quest for the legendary elephant burial grounds and their ivory. They are joined by Parkers daughter Jane (Maureen OSullivan). Holt is attracted to Jane, and tries somewhat ineffectively to protect her from the jungles dangers. He notably fails to prevent her abduction by the jungles guardian, the mysterious Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller) and his ape allies. The experience is terrifying to Jane at first, but as their relationship develops, she finds herself happy: "Not a bit afraid, not a bit sorry." As she returns to her father, her feelings are brought to a test. She wants Tarzan to come with her to London, and to be part of her world. But Tarzan turns his back on her and returns to the jungle. Her father tells her that is where Tarzan belongs, she cries, "No dad, he belongs to me." The expedition is captured by a tribe of aggressive dwarfs. Jane sends Tarzans ape friend Cheeta (Jiggs) for help, bringing Tarzan to their rescue. During the rescue, Tarzan summons elephants and they escape from the dwarfs stronghold, although Janes father dies from wounds just as they reach the elephant graveyard. Jane decides to stay in the jungle with Tarzan and in the final scene, to the music of Tchaikovskys Romeo and Juliet, the happy couple appear on a rock, Jane holding Cheeta like a baby.
