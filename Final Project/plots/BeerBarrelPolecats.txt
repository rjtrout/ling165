Unable to purchase a bottle of beer due to Prohibition (despite it being repealed 13 years ago), the Stooges opt to brew some of the stuff themselves. The recipe that they use calls for three small cubes of yeast. A mix-up with the telephone causes each Stooge to think he is the one to put in the yeast. Nine cubes end up in the tub being used to make the beer. The yeast continuously expands causing them to pour the beer into every container they can find, until Curly brings in the bath tub. They successfully bottle their brew only to leave the bottles too close to an open flame. Many of the bottles explode sending corks and suds all over the kitchen. Unfortunately, Curly ends up selling a bottle at the black market price to a detective, landing the trio in jail. They were due to serve a short amount of time, but Curly tries to smuggle a barrel of beer in jail under his overcoat. The barrel explodes under the heat of lights while the trio has their mugshots taken. While in prison, the Stooges begin to plot their escape, and end up destroying the saws being used to whittle down the iron bars in their cell. A few days later, the Stooges have a run-in with a fellow convict (Joe Palma), leading them to knock the warden (Vernon Dent) out cold, and landing them on the rock pile. While hammering away, the boys stumble on an old friend also in the clink, Percy Pomeroy (Eddie Laughton), and work together to flee the prison. They are ultimately captured, and sent to solitary confinement. After nearly half a century later, the graying trio are finally released as senior citizens, in which Curly quips upon leaving "You know what Im-a gonna do? Im gonna get myself a tall, big, beautiful bottle of beer!" Moe and Larry become irate and throw Curly back into the jail, leaving him there.
