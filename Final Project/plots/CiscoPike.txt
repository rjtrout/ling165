The film centers on Cisco Pike (played by Kris Kristofferson), an out-of-luck and out-of-work musician, and Sergeant Leo Holland (played by Gene Hackman). Cisco is a former drug dealer who has been busted several times by Sgt. Holland, and one night Holland comes to the door and demands that Cisco move a large amount of marijuana for him or suffer jail. Cisco has several misadventures selling the marijuana, meets up with Doug Sahm at a recording studio, has his friend Jesse Dupree visit (played by Harry Dean Stanton, billed as H.D. Stanton for this film), meets a pregnant rich girl and her friend, and tries to make good with the Sergeant in the time allotted to him.
