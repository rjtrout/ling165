Beth Austin (Joan Crawford) is the leader of a hold-up gang and the mistress of its most cold-blooded killer Matt Jackson (David Brian). In New Orleans, the group robs a casino by impersonating police officers. After taking in a haul of $90,000 ($791,000 in 2013 dollars), she tells Matt that she has suffered from failing eyesight and needs to travel to an eye clinic in Indiana to have an advanced operation. While initially mad that she is leaving the group, he promises to lie low until she returns. At the hospital, Beth and her eye surgeon, Ben Halleck (Dennis Morgan), fall in love. Meanwhile, Jackson becomes suspicious of his mistresss lengthy recovery period and sends a private investigator to snoop about. Beth breaks off her relationship with the doctor, hoping to dissuade Jackson from committing any harm against him. Jackson travels to the hospital planning to wipe out the man who has displaced him in Beths affections, but the FBI shoots and kills Matt. Beth is promised leniency, and looks forward to a life with the doctor after a short prison sentence.
