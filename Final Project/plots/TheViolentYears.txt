Paula Parkins, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do newspaper editor father and a socialite mother, gets her kicks by organizing and directing a gang of bored young women like herself. The gang dresses in mens attire, robs gas stations, and terrorizes habitués of a local lovers lane—even raping a young gentleman (off camera) after tying up his girlfriend. As a newspaperman, Paulas father has some inside information on police plans to capture the gang, so the girls are able to avoid capture with Mr. Parkins unwitting complicity. After a make-out party with a few local gangsters, Paula and her pals agree to wreck a few classrooms — and destroy the American flag — in a public school at the behest of Sheila, a female crime boss. (It is implied that this is part of an anti-American Communist plot.) The girls perform the job with gleeful competence until the police arrive and a deadly shootout takes place, claiming the lives of two of Paulas gang while Paula shoots and kills a policeman. Seeking refuge from the police, the girls return to Sheilas to demand their payment for wrecking the school. But Sheila, not wanting to be involved or arrested for their crime, starts to call the police until Paula fatally shoots her. While leading the police on a car chase, Paula crashes the car into a stores plate-glass window, injuring her and killing her last gang member. Paula is captured and convicted, then dies in the hospital giving birth to the child she accidentally conceived. The judge in Paulas case denies her parents custody of their granddaughter, based on the neglectful way they raised Paula. The cynical tag line "So what?" is used repeatedly by the girls to underscore their uncaring, nihilistic attitude.
