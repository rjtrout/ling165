Bess Johnson, newly arrived in a Mormon settlement in Wyoming Territory, is having difficulty getting a shipment of smallpox vaccine delivered. In her way are Little Otter, a chief of the Blackfeet who wishes death to all whites in the territory, and Brill, a gambler who is interested in both Bess and a secret gold mine the Mormons might be hiding. Dan Kree, a gunfighter, happens by on his way to Oregon and gives aid to Bess, who in turn saves him from a lethal snake bite. The mine turns out to be real, but Little Otter is killed and Dan gets the better of Brill. He leaves, but tells Bess he could be back.
