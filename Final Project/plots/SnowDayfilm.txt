The film focuses on a group of elementary school students in Syracuse, New York, led by Natalie Brandston (Zena Grey), who get a snow day, and try to keep their school snowed in and closed for a second day by stopping a snowplow driver (Chris Elliott) from plowing the streets. Meanwhile, Natalies older brother, Hal (Mark Webber), tries to win the heart of popular high school girl Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui), with the help of his best friend, Lane Leonard (Schuyler Fisk), who secretly harbors feelings for him. Also, their father, Tom (Chevy Chase), is a television meteorologist who must face off against a rival, Chad Symmonz (John Schneider), in order to continue his career. Their workaholic mother, Laura (Jean Smart), is stuck at home with their mischievous brother, Randy. Eventually, Natalie and her friends, Wayne (Josh Peck) and Chet (Jade Yorker), take over the plow and "unplow" the streets (move all the snow back in the way). After endless love demonstrations (and being rescued by Natalie), Hal finds out he, in fact, loves Lane. He is even encouraged by Claire to go after her. Tom unmasks Chad on live TV, showing the viewers that he is fake, and winning back his status. Chad is arrested and Laura takes the day off from work to look after Randy. When Principal Weaver gets home the kids hit him with a lot of snowballs.
