Kenny Dantley is a car-loving Southern California high school senior. For a project in his shop class, Kenny helps build a customized Chevrolet Corvette Stingray with a right-hand-drive. Shortly after the new set of wheels is unveiled, the car is stolen from the streets of Van Nuys. After hearing that the car is in Las Vegas, Kenny immediately sets out on an adventure to take back the stolen car. On the way, he meets the seemingly confident Vanessa, who is a self-described "prostitute-in-training." Kenny finds work in a Vegas car wash, and spots his car on more than one occasion. He tracks it down it to a local garage, where he has an incident with the garage owner, Wayne Lowry, before being bailed out by Vanessa. Kenny’s high school teacher, Ed McGrath comes to Las Vegas, and Kenny is upset to learn that the teacher he once admired had arranged for the theft of the Corvette to help supplement his low earnings as a teacher. McGrath arranges for Kenny go to work for Lowry. On behalf of himself and his family, McGrath begs Kenny not to take the matter to the police. McGrath also ominously notes that if Kenny doesnt agree, one of Lowrys men will "handle it his way." Kenny agrees and will make good money with Lowry, but secretly plans to take the Corvette back. Eventually, Kenny completes his plans, takes the car back, saves Vanessa from an unusual scenario in a hotel, wins a wild car chase, and returns in triumph with the Corvette—and Vanessa—to his old high school. He keeps McGraths secret, but rebuffs his attempts to repair their friendship. He gives the car back to the school, but walks away with Vanessa and his freshly-earned high school diploma.
