A British actor attempts to impress visiting American relatives by having the cast of his drawing-room comedy pose as his aristocratic family. The American mother persuades the butler (Hope), really a struggling American actor playing a British butler, to come to the United States with them. She sends a telegram home, referring to him as a "gentlemans gentleman," which the rural western townfolk misunderstand as being an aristocrat and presumably the future husband of the familys tomboyish daughter (Ball). Hope must now pretend to the family that he is a British butler while pretending to the rest of the town, and the visiting President Theodore Roosevelt that he is a politically savvy Englishman. The deception is eventually uncovered, and the actor and the familys daughter eventually fall in love.
