Antoine marries beautiful Consuelo (Miranda Richardson), and they set up house in Casablanca. The constant strain on their marriage from his dangerous flights results in Consuelo leaving and going to Paris. Antoine goes after her, they reconcile, but he refuses to give up flying even when he is almost killed when he crashes in an attempt to break the Paris-Saigon air record. By the late 1930s, Antoine becomes a successful airmail pilot flying in Europe, Africa and South America. During this period, he became a writer, with his most famous work being The Little Prince. At the outbreak of World War II, Antoine joins the French Air Force (Armée de lAir), but after France is defeated, he joins the Free French Air Force in North Africa. In July 1944, while flying a F-5 Lightning on a reconnaissance mission over the Mediterranean, Antoine mysteriously disappears.
