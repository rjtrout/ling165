Just after the American Civil War, a former soldier, Hogan, rides up on a naked woman about to be raped by bandits. Hogan kills the bandits, showing not only that he can shoot, but that he is an expert with explosives. He is taken aback when he sees that the woman he has saved is a nun. Sister Sara is raising money to assist Mexican revolutionaries who are fighting the French. When Sara requests that Hogan takes her to a Mexican camp, he agrees because he had previously arranged to help the Mexican revolutionaries attack the French garrison in exchange for half the garrisons treasury, if they are successful. As the duo heads towards the camp, Hogan is surprised that the nun drinks his whiskey. Before he attempts to detonate a charge to destroy a French ammunition train, he is shot with an arrow in the shoulder. Sara is able to bandage him, but he is still unable to shoot the charge to disable the train himself. Sara assists him in aiming his rifle, and the two succeed in destroying the train together. Eventually the two reach Juarista commander Col. Beltrans camp and Sara reveals the layout of the French garrison. She then reveals to Hogan that she is not a nun but a prostitute posing as a nun. Although Hogan is shocked, the two team up, infiltrate the fortress and open the gates for the Mexican revolutionary forces to swarm through. A battle ensues. Hogan singlehandedly guns down several French soldiers. The French retreat and the Mexicans capture the fort. As promised, Hogan receives half the riches. Now wealthy and his job completed, Hogan sets off with Sara, whom he has fallen in love with, to open a gambling house in San Francisco.
