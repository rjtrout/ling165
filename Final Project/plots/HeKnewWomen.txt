Geoffrey Clarke is a poor poet, who has his eyes on the fortune of a rich widow, Alice Frayne, in order to keep him in the lifestyle he feels he deserves. Geoffrey is pursued, however, by the young and lovely, yet poor, Monica Grey. Monica, in turn, is pursued by the chemist, Austin Lowe. When Geoffrey tells Monica that she would be better off with Austin, she is disdainful of the suggestion. Undaunted, he sets the two of them up to have dinner at Geoffreys apartment. During the dinner, Monica is completely unimpressed with Austin, but when she discovers that Alice has been financially supporting Geoffrey, out of spite she agrees to marry Austin. Regretting her decision, later, when she learns that Alice intends to marry Geoffrey, Monica becomes desperate and falsely accuses Geoffrey in front of the others of having ruined her. This causes Alice to break off her engagement with Geoffrey. However, it has a drastic effect on Austin, who gets a pistol and takes a very poorly aimed shot at Geoffrey. Standing up for her honor causes Monica to re-evaluate her feelings for Austin, and she agrees, this time for real, to marry him. When the falsity of Monicas claim is revealed, Geoffrey and Alice reconcile as well.
