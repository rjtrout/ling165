Suzanne is a successful realtor living in the suburbs of Washington D.C. with her weatherman husband Jeff. With Christmas just a month away, Suzanne and Jeff celebrate an imminent move to Hawaii; things cant be better with Suzanne as she giddily anticipates the move and her favorite time of year. However, after coming home one day to find her husband brutally murdered, Suzannes life becomes filled with overwhelmed grief. A few days later, a get-together is held at Suzannes house with friends and family following Jeffs funeral. During this time, a co-worker of Jeffs approaches Suzanne in tears. After finding privacy in the bathroom, the co-worker explains to Suzanne that Jeff was involved for a long time with young stripper named Autumn. Surprised by the story, Suzanne later goes to the household computer and logs on under Jeffs user. Under the history tab of his Internet browser, Suzanne finds that Jeff had visited sites of ethnic pornography. Following the tragedy, Suzanne takes off from work per suggestion of her colleagues. During this time, she tracks down the stripper, whose real name is Fantasia, and the two begin to bond over their mutual loss. Through her relationship with Fantasia, Suzanne begins to cut loose â€“ joining the stripper on escapades of clubbing and shoplifting.
