The adventurer Al Colby is persuaded by Anna Luz and her antiquities collector husband, Thomas Berrien, to help them smuggle a parcel back into Mexico where its true value can be ascertained. Warned that a man named Jefferson traveling on the same freighter might try to steal it, Colby ultimately forms a partnership with Jefferson following the fatal heart attack of Berrien aboard ship. Jefferson betrays and shoots him, but Colby saves himself and the rare documents in time. They will be returned to a museum while he and Anna can enjoy a $25,000 reward.
