Phil Blackwood (Selleck) is an American mystery novelist who comes across a dazzling Romanian murder suspect named Nina (Porizkova) when she is arraigned in the courtroom he is visiting. Instantly falling for her, Blackwood poses as a Roman Catholic priest in order to meet her while Nina is held pending her continued arraignment. With the help of his publisher and friend, Sam (Daniels), Blackwood invents an alibi for Nina to secure her release. Nina then takes up residence with Blackwood, serving as the inspiration for a novel that will decide the fate of his and Sams careers in writing and publishing, all while evading operatives from communist Romania. The climax of the film takes place during The Funeral of Grimaldi, a jovial memorial service in which many clowns gather to celebrate the life of Joseph Grimaldi.
