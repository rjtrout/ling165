The bodies of farmer Fred Morgan and his housekeeper are found. Suspicion falls on hired hand George Braden, who owns a handgun that his pregnant wife Ellen disposes of in a panic. Braden confesses under the interrogation of district attorney Jim Gillespie, possibly to spare his wife any more grief. Doug Madison is assigned the case in court, but doesnt believe in Bradens innocence until he sees Ellen diving into the lake, attempting to retrieve the gun. Madisons fiancee doesnt want him defending an unpopular client because it could harm his political future. A diver hired by Madison makes a play for Ellen, and when he is fired, he suggests Madison is romantically involved with Ellen. After a conviction and death sentence for Braden, it comes to Madisons attention that an ex-con named Max Verne had worked for the dead man and made threats after being dismissed. Madison ends up in a race against time to prove Bradens innocence before he is executed.
