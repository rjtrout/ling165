A redheaded American girl from New York finds herself in a love triangle in the City of Light (Paris, France). Maggie Scott (Ann-Margret) works as an assistant buyer for Irene Chase (Edie Adams). Irene is a fashion buyer for Barclay Ames, an upscale clothing store in New York owned by Roger Barclay (John McGiver). Ted Barclay (Chad Everett), the son of Roger Barclay, takes a special interest in Maggie. After taking her on a date, he finds that her morals are different from the multitude of his previous women. This bachelor doesn’t seem to mind a good chase. Irene sends Maggie to Paris as her representative for the annual fashion shows of the major European fashion designers such as Marc Fontaine, Dior, and Balenciaga. The most important show is Marc Fontaine (Louis Jourdan) because Barclay Ames is the only store in New York that handles Fontaine gowns, and Maggie must keep that rapport between the two companies on her trip. Worried for Maggie’s safety, Ted calls his Paris-based columnist friend, Herb Stone (Richard Crenna), to look after her in Paris. Maggie’s arrival in Paris is paired with a warning from Herb Stone that she may lose all of her inhibitions, which she quickly denies could happen. Marc Fontaine, the handsome French designer, had a relationship with Irene. It doesn’t take long for the Parisian scenery to play with Maggie’s emotions, leading her into the arms of Mr. Fontaine. Herb Stone completes the love triangle by pursuing Maggie as well. His version of a good time doesn’t involve the exciting dance club Maggie dances in for Mr. Fontaine. He would rather settle down in the bedroom. Ted Barclay decides to fly out to Paris to win Maggie’s heart once and for all.
