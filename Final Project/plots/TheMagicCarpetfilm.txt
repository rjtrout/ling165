Omar, the caliph, and Yazmina, the queen, arrange their infant sons escape when rival Ali decides to forcibly overthrow them. Before they are slain, they make sure the baby, his locket and magic carpet end up in the safe hands of an uncle, Ahkmid, a physician who then raises young Ramoth to manhood. Ramoth, unaware he is the rightful heir but disapproving of Alis tyranny, disguises himself as "The Scarlet Falcon" and, assisted by friend Razi and Razis beautiful sister Lida, attempts to disrupt the caliphs reign. The evil Boreg becomes his nemesis, as does Narah, a princess who is the sister of Ali. Ahkmid, mortally wounded by Boreg, reveals to Ramoth his true identity. Lida endeavors to infiltrate Alis forces by disguising herself as a dancer, but she is caught and imprisoned. Ramoth is also taken prisoner, but Lida escapes and sends the magic carpet to rescue Ramoth in the nick of time. Ali is killed, Narah placed in a dungeon as Ramoth and Lida fly off on the carpet to begin a new life.
