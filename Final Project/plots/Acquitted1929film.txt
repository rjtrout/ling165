Marian is sent to prison for a crime she did not commit. While there she meets fellow convict, Dr. Bradford, who has also been wrongly convicted of a murder. Marion believes his innocence and falls in love with him. Bradford tells her that it was Egan who framed him. Meanwhile, Egan has fallen in love with Marian, and when Marian is paroled, begins to woo her. She goes along with his romances, hoping to get the info she needs to free Bradford. However, Egan is warned of her intentions by associates who are still in the jail. When Egan confronts Marian, she admits her plan, but tells Egan of her love for Bradford. Egan, pretending to help Marian out, agrees to get Bradford released, and pays one of his henchmen, Smith, to confess to the crime for which Bradford is in prison for. Once Bradford is released, Egan attempts to leverage his role in that release, to force Marian to marry him. When she refuses, he has Bradford kidnapped, intending to have him killed. Learning of it, an armed Marian confronts Egan, and when he refuses to divulge Bradfords whereabouts, she shoots him. Grievously wounded, Egan needs immediate medical attention. Regretting her action, she pleads with Egan to tell him where Bradford is, so that he can tend to the wound. Once Egan tells her where he has Bradford stashed, Marian rushes to free him, returning to Egan, where Bradford tends to the gunshot wound. The woman and doctor are followed by the police, who overhear Egan confessing to the murder for which Bradford was originally convicted. The wound patched, Egan is taken to jail, while Bradford and Marian end up together.
