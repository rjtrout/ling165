Mrs. Emily Pollifax of New Jersey goes to the CIA to volunteer for spy duty, being in her own opinion, expendable now that the children are grown and shes widowed. And being just what the department needed (someone who looks and acts completely unlike a spy), shes assigned to simple courier duty to pick up a book in Mexico City. She finds this easier said than done. The films tagline summizes the person of Pollifax: Before she joined the CIA, Mrs. Pollifax thought Red China was a set of dishes.
