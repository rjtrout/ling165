Ted Cotter, a successful singer, spots Rose Sargent performing in an amateur contest. He immediately takes a personal and professional interest in her, helping her career along as she joins the famed Ziegfeld Follies and begins to achieve stardom. Rose does not recognize Teds love for her, falling instead for Bart Clinton, a gambler and con man. Barts nefarious activities get him arrested, and after Ted puts up his bail, Bart skips town. Rose pines away for him, until one night, when Bart goes to the Follies and hears her tearful rendition of the song "My Man," he realizes the error of his ways and sets out to make things right.
