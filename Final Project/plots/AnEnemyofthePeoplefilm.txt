Thomas Stockmann (Steve McQueen) is a doctor and amateur scientist in a small unnamed Norwegian town. The town is expecting a major boost in tourism due to the therapeutic powers of nearby springs but Stockmann has discovered they are being polluted by waste from the towns tannery. He writes an article exposing the contamination for the local newspaper, the Messenger, but the staff is intimidated by Stockmanns brother Peter, the town mayor. Peter offers to use the springs revenue to implement the changes his brother wants if Thomas will keep quiet but the doctor remains uncompromising. Thomas calls a town meeting in order to spread the news but his brother and the newspapers publishers shout him down and deride him and he is unable to state his case. The townspeople treat the previously respected and popular Stockmann family as pariahs - his daughter is dismissed from school and rocks are thrown through the windows of their house. Thomas family remain loyal to him, however, and decide against emigrating to America. Instead they decide to stay in the town and wait for Thomas discovery to be proved in time. As they celebrate their decision, a fresh hail of stones come through the family homes windows.
