As described in a film magazine, Yvonne (Vidor), the wife of German officer Karl Von Drutz (von Seyffertitz), is left in their Belgian home at the start of World War I. King Albert (Hall) stops at the house during his retreat where he finds little Jacques (Stone) playing soldier. The king tells him to be brave and wait "till I come back to you." America enters the war and Capt. Jefferson Strong (Washburn) is detailed to destroy the German storehouse containing their liquid fire supply. He pretends to be an escaped German soldier and hides in Yvonnes cottage, learns of the supplies, and directs the tunneling under the house. Von Drutz returns, finds Strong telephoning, and a terrific struggle ensues. Little Jacques takes a score of orphans from a nearby asylum and they escape through the tunnel. Strong saves the lives of the children but is arrested for disobedience, tried, and court martialed. Through the influence of King Albert he is saved from being shot. Yvonne, whose husband has been killed, finds consolation in Strongs love.
