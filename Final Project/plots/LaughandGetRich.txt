Sarah Austin (Edna May Oliver) runs a boarding house during the Depression, always on the verge of bankruptcy. Her husband, Joe (Hugh Herbert) is a shiftless person who has never understood the concept of work; he is constantly involving them in get-rich-quick schemes. Their daughter, Alice (Dorothy Lee), has her eyes set on poor young inventor, Larry Owens (Russell Gleason), but her mother wishes she would become involved with Bill Hepburn (John Harron), seemingly from a well-connected family. Sarahs illusions about Bill, however, are dashed when Bill kidnaps Joe, whom he mistakes for Mr. Pennypacker. Shortly after this, Joe takes Sarahs life savings, which she has hidden in a lamp, and invests it in an oil well, conned into it by one of Sarahs boarders, Mr. Phelps (Robert Emmett Keane). When Sarah finds out, she is furious, so Joe goes out and takes a job as a ditch digger. However, much to everyones surprise, the oil well actually strikes oil. Believing that they are rich, Sarah and Joe go visit Sarahs sister, Cassie Palfrey (Louise Mackintosh), who lives in an estate on Long Island. While there, the oil well runs dry, and their newfound wealth evaporates. However, all is not lost, as they find out that one of Joes inventions, a tire valve, has attracted an investor, and they will be making over $50,000 per year off the invention, a veritable fortune in 1931.
