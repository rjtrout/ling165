Ellen Neal is hired as servant in the house of the wealthy Winfield family by the butler, Thomas Wroxton, who covets her romantically. Wroxton rules the household staff like a tyrant, demanding a large cut of their weekly wages as his "commission". To his great irritation, Neal resists his advances. Instead, during the familys vacation in New England she becomes romantically involved with the Winfields son, Richard, who is a college student. They secretly marry and she falls pregnant by him before he returns to college. When the Winfields are told by a vengeful Wroxton that she is pregnant they are initially sympathetic until discovering that the child is their own grandson. A prolonged divorce suit then follows until the couple are finally reconciled.
