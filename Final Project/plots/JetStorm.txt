Ernest Tilley (Richard Attenborough), a former scientist who lost his daughter two years earlier in a hit-and-run accident, tracks down James Brock (George Rose), the man he believes is responsible for the accident and boards the same airliner on a transatlantic flight, flying from London to New York. Tilley threatens to blow himself up and everyone on board as an act of vengeance. When Captain Bardow (Stanley Baker) and the passengers realize that he is serious, and they cannot find the bomb (which Tilley had attached to the underside of the airliners left wing), they begin to panic. Some want to pressure him into revealing the location of the bomb, while others such as Doctor Bergstein (David Kossoff) try to reason with the now silent Tilley. Mulliner (Patrick Allen), a terrified passenger, attempts to kill Brock to get Tilley to not set off the bomb. Acting out of fear, Brock is killed when he smashes a window and is sucked out of the airliner. Tilley, coming to his senses when a young boy passenger soothes him, disconnects the remote control for the bomb, then commits suicide by poison. As the airliner approaches New York, the passengers realize that they will survive.
