Freddy Merkle never finishes anything. He has a half-done painting, half a sculpture and a sonata hes been composing for quite a while. His girlfriend Ginny encourages him to finish something he starts, but Freddy, a delivery boy, never quite gets around to it. After an accident in which his bicycle runs into a circus elephant, Freddy runs into Duke, a fast-talking operator who knows of a songwriting contest with a $2,500 first prize. At the coaxing of Duke and Ginny, the song is finally finished, but the sheet music blows away in the wind. Freddy, forlorn as usual, decides to kill himself, but he cant even get that right. Hes at the end of his rope when a kindly priest discovers the song, submits it to the contest and, sure enough, it becomes the winner.
