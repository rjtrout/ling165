Illinois, 1876: Tom Muldoon turns up in the capital city of Springfield, telling an old acquaintance, undertaker John Langley, that he has just gotten out of prison in Joliet. He shows Langley a new $50 bill created by a counterfeiter who had been his cellmate. Muldoon proposes a scheme. The counterfeiter has hidden $100,000 in counterfeit currency, plus the engraving plates that can make more. But he is serving a life sentence, so Muldoons idea is to kidnap the wardens daughter and trade her for the counterfeiters release. Langley agrees and persuades his partner Herbert Evans, mortuary employee Jed and niece Carol Ann to be accomplices. They find the wardens daughter working in a Chicago mission. Together they take the young woman hostage, but a carriage accident permits her to escape. Desperately needing a new plan, Muldoon suggests becoming grave robbers, stealing the body Abraham Lincoln from its Springfield resting place. Evans, an admirer of Lincoln, objects and Muldoon murders him. Secret Service agent Fred Winters is tipped off that a crime is in progress. After the criminals discover Lincolns tomb to be impenetrable, Muldoon is killed by a frightened horse. Langley gets 20 years in prison, also discovering that the counterfeiters ruse was a lie.
