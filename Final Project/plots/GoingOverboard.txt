Shecky Moskowitz (Sandler) is a struggling comedian working on a cruise ship. Shecky gets his chance to be the ships comedian when it is thought that the regular comedian, Dickie Diamond (LaRose), had fallen overboard and drowned. (Dickie actually locked himself in the mens room) Shecky is nervous about performing, but King Neptune (Zane) convinces him to go for the opportunity by telling Shecky about the power of laughter. Sheckys first performance is very unsuccessful as he is booed off the stage, he is especially heckled by the construction worker Dave (Thornton). However, after a lecture by Milton Berle, Shecky succeeds in making the audience laugh. At that point, the terrorists come onboard and want to kill Miss Australia. Shecky, remembering the advice about the power of laughter, saves her by promising to put the assassins in a film.
