In 1901, mail-order bride Joanna (Eleanor Parker) arrives from New Orleans at a South American cocoa plantation to meet her new husband, plantation owner Christopher Leiningen (Charlton Heston), whom she has married by proxy. Leiningen is cold and remote to her, rebuffing all her attempts to make friends with him. She is beautiful, independent, and arrives ready to be his stalwart helpmate; however, no one has told him that she is a widow. He rejects her because he had wanted to marry a virgin. As she awaits the boat to take her back to the United States, they learn that legions of army ants - the "marabunta" - will strike in a few days time. Leiningen refuses to give up the home he fought so hard to create. Instead of evacuating, he resolves to make a stand against this indomitable natural predator. Joanna joins the fight to save the plantation; their courage and his probable loss of all he has worked for crack his resolve to send her away.
