The pair of Bobby Keller (Corey Feldman) and Dinger (Corey Haim) each find themselves with a pair of seemingly ordinary sunglasses. But, this is no normal pair of shades â€” once two people are wearing the set, one can manipulate the other physically to do whatever their mind wishes to. The set of sunglasses were part of an experiment, and the original owners of the products will stop at nothing to get them back from Bobby and Dinger.
