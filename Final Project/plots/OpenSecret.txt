Newlyweds Paul Lester (Ireland) and his wife Nancy (Randolph) are invited to visit Pauls friend Ed Stevens. They arrive to find Stevens gone and a mysterious phone call gets Paul to the other end of town. While hes away, Nancy is assaulted by a would-be burglar. Paul thinks theres something more going on than a missing persons case or a burglary and tries to interest Police Detective Frontelli (Leonard) in looking into it, but Frontelli is initially skeptical. When Stevens turns up under the wheels of a truck along with evidence tying him to an earlier hit-and-run murder, Paul is certain that theres some kind of organized conspiracy afoot. What he finds is a town slowly coming under siege from a secret band of anti-Semitic thugs masquerading as a patriotic organization, with whom Stevens had been involved and tried to quit. Paul and Nancys situation goes from bad to dangerous when they accidentally stumble upon evidence that could hang the murderers.
