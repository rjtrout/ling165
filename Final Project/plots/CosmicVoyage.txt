Cosmic Voyage takes on a similar format as the National Film Board of Canadas Cosmic Zoom, and IBMs classic Powers of Ten educational video. All based on the book Cosmic View by Kees Boeke. The film takes viewers on a journey through forty-two orders of magnitude, beginning at a celebration in Venice, Italy slowly zooming out into the edge of the observable universe. The view descends back to earth, and later zooms in upon a raindrop on a leaf on a hoop used in the celebration mentioned earlier, to the level of subatomic particles (quarks). In addition, the film offers some brief insight on the Big Bang theory, black holes, and the development of our Solar System. It also simulates a journey through Fermilabs Tevatron particle accelerator in Chicago, where an atom collision is depicted.
