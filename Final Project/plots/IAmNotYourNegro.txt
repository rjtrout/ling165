This 93-minute feature documentary is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and is entirely inspired by James Baldwins unfinished manuscript, Remember This House, a collection of notes and letters written by Baldwin in the mid-1970s. The memoir recounts the lives of his close friends and civil rights leaders Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., and Medgar Evers.
