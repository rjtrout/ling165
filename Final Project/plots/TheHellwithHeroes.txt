In 1946, after fighting in World War II, two former United States Air Force pilots in North Africa, Brynie MacKay (Rod Taylor) and Mike Brewer (Pete Duel) are forced to work for Lee Harris (Harry Guardino), an international smuggler to get money needed for their return to civilian life. The smuggler wants them to fly to France, with Egyptian cotton cargo. When Brynie finds that their real cargo is contraband cigarettes, he extorts Harris for more money. In retaliation, Harris plants narcotics on Brynies aircraft and informs Colonel Wilson (Kevin McCarthy) at U. S. Counterintelligence. With Byrnies aircraft impounded and his money seized, Elena (Claudia Cardinale), Harriss mistress comes to his aid. Harris exacts a promise for 12 more illegal cargo flights, but Mike warns that they will both be killed if they go ahead with this scheme. When Mike tries to trap Harris by informing Col. Wilson about the smuggling runs, Harris, who is flying with the two pilots, kills Mike, but is knocked out by Byrnie. Fearing Harriss gang is waiting for him at the prearranged destination, Byrnie lands his aircraft at an abandoned military air strip and informs Wilson where the contraband can be found. With Elena at his side, Byrnie then escapes to North Africa. When Harris tracks them down, Brynie overcomes Harris and turns him over to Wilson, and because of the deal Mike had made, is released. Byrnie decides to return to the United States with Elena and become a teacher, his former profession.
