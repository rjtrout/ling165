A gunsmith and a marksman, Daniel Bone closes up his Brooklyn, New York business and travels west, where he feels he belongs. On a train, he encounters passenger Liza Crockett, then sees her purse being stolen by a man Dan confronts, disarms and throws off the train. The man turns out to be a notorious outlaw, the Pecos Kid, who vows revenge against "the dude" who interfered with his holdup. Liza, however, mistakenly believes Dan was the one who tried to steal her bag. On their way to Arsenic City, Nevada, where a map to her fathers gold mine might make Liza a wealthy woman, both she and Dan end up traveling from Carson City in a buckboard. Indians capture them, but Dans knowledge of their language impresses the tribes chief. After arriving in Arsenic City, the two encounter another outlaw, Texas Jack Barton, and a corrupt saloonkeeper, Kiki Kelly, who are all interested in the mine. Dan finds the map, memorizes it and burns it. He falls in love with Liza and leads her to the gold. When the outlaws ambush them, their new Indian friends ride to their rescue.
