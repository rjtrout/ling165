Dave Whiteman and his wife, Barbara, are a couple whose 20-year marriage is unfulfilling. Dave is having an affair with Carmen, the live-in maid, while Barbara tries to relieve her constant feelings of anxiety by experimenting with various New Age therapies. A "down and out" homeless man named Jerry Baskin wanders into the backyard of the Whitemans Beverly Hills home, and tries to drown himself in the pool. Dave helps Jerry get back on his feet. The family is initially disgusted by Jerry, but they end up growing fond of him after getting to know him better.
