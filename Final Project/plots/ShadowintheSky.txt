Although they want to let Burt live in their home, Lou and Betty worry about his volatile behavior around their two young children. Stella Murphy has met Burt at a hospital dance and urges him to find a home of his own. She wants him to move to Oregon with her and work on her grandfathers farm, but that regions rainy climate discourages him. Burt decides to invest in the Hopkes gas station, causing an angry Stella to leave him. Burt uses his savings to buy a small boat, which he fixes up. Lou and Bettys young son Chris keeps pleading with Burt to take him sailing. The boy stows away when Burt launches the boat, but Burt sends him safely home.

The boy falls overboard, but his cries of help remind Burt of how he saved Lous life in another torrential downpour. He rescues the boy, after which everyone is assured that Burt is going to be all right.
