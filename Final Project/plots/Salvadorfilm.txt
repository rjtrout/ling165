Veteran photojournalist Richard Boyle has been taking his camera to the worlds trouble spots for over 20 years. While he does good work, Boyles fondness for booze and drugs, and his colossal arrogance, have given him a reputation thats left him practically unemployable. Broke and with no immediate prospects, Boyle and his buddy, Doctor Rock, an out-of-work disc jockey, head to El Salvador, where Boyle is convinced that he can scrounge some lucrative freelance work amidst the nations political turmoil. However, when Boyle and Rock witness the execution of a student by government troops just as they enter the country, it becomes clear that this war is more serious than they were expecting. Increasingly convinced that El Salvador is a disaster starting to happen, Boyle eventually decides that its time to get out, but hes reunited with an old flame named Maria and her two children (one of whom is his), and he doesnt want to leave her behind. While attempting to get her out of the country, Boyle is harassed by the military due to his profession and eventually leads to the deaths to innocent people by death squads. Boyle and Maria eventually leave the country towards the United States. However, upon entering California, their bus is stopped by immigration officers and Maria allows herself to be deported alongside her children due to her guilt of leaving her homecountry behind while Boyle is arrested after desperately arguing with the officers.
