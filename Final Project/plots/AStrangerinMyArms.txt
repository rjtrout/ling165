A Korean War test pilot, Major Pike Yarnell (Jeff Chandler), survives a jet crash in the Pacific Ocean, as does his navigator Donald Beasley (Peter Graves). After 12 days on a raft, Donald dies, but Pike is rescued. Christina (June Allyson), the dead officers widow, waits for a full explanation of the circumstances of her husbands death, as do his wealthy Georgia parents and sister. Pike gives them very few details, however, particularly disturbing Virginie Beasley (Mary Astor), who wants a Congressman in the family to seek a Medal of Honor for her brave son. Pike begins to develop feelings for Christina. He cannot bring himself to tell her that Donald was actually a poor officer and under investigation. During the ocean flight, his navigational mistake leads to the crash. While on the raft, Donald proves to be a coward. Donald revealed near the end, that he never loved his wife and hated his mother. Ultimately, he used Pikes gun to kill himself.
