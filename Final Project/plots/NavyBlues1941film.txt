Margie Jordan and her friend Lilibelle Bolton arrive in Honolulu, Hawaii, much to the surprise of Lillibelles former husband, Powerhouse Bolton, a sailor who is behind on the alimony he owes her. In need of money, Powerhouse and his shipmate Cake OHara come up with a scheme. Learning that the crew is about to include Homer Matthews, a marksman, they make bets with practically everybody aboard on how a shooting competition will turn out. They are then stunned when it turns out Homers going home, his service hitch being up before the contest. Although he misses the family farm, Homer falls in love with Margie and wants to marry her but Powerhouse and Cake fib to him that Margies only interested in his shooting skill. Homer re-enlists, wins the contest and wins Margie, too, while Lilibelle grabs the prize money before Powerhouse can.
