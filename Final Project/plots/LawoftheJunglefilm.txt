A singer, Nona Brooks, is stranded at a hotel in Africa because her passport is missing. It turns out enemy agents, in collaboration with hotel owner Simmons, have stolen her papers, then try to use her for their nefarious schemes. Brooks flees and encounters paleontologist Larry Mason in the jungle. He and his assistant Jefferson Jones give her shelter, then fend off unfriendly natives while Simmons is murdered by the villainous agents. All looks hopeless until the tribal chief turns out to be a reasonable, Oxford-educated man who helps Larry and Nona out of their jam.
