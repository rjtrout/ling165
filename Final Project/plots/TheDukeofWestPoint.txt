An American diplomats son, Steven Early, having been educated in England, comes to West Point and enrolls, nicknamed "The Duke" by the others because of his background and bearing. Steve becomes a scholar and athlete, excelling in ice hockey. His roommates and friends are cadets Sonny Drew and Jack West, and he develops a romantic interest in Ann Porter, angering another cadet who loves her. When word reaches him that Jacks mother is having trouble with the business and needs help, Steve sneaks off campus after Taps to wire money to her, so that Jack will not have to give up West Point, making her promise not to tell who sent it but to tell Jack that all is well. Caught upon his return, Steve lies as to where he went so that his friend will not find out about the money. The lie is in violation of the Honor Code and results in his being shunned by all other cadets for the next year, given the silent treatment. Before a big hockey game against a team of cadets from Canada, a serious accident befalls Sonny that leaves him unable to play, with possible permanent damage. Steve wears his friends jersey and helps West Point win the game, but has made up his mind to submit his resignation as soon as the game ends. But then, the others learn from Jacks mother what Steve did for her and Jack, feeling very guilty, they all welcome him back among them.
