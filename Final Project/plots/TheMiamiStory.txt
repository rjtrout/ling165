Miami mob boss Tony Brill and hit man Ted Delacorte continue to elude the law. A scheme is hatched by attorney Frank Alton to bring former murder suspect Mick Flagg out of hiding, hoping he can infiltrate Brills outfit. Flagg reluctantly agrees. He leaves young son Gil with a Florida family, then gains Brills trust, as well as that of Holly Abbott, whose sister Gwen is now the girlfriend of Brill. Although he succeeds in disrupting Brills business interests, Flagg is helpless to prevent Holly from being physically assaulted and Gil kidnapped. Holly betrays her sister, resulting in Gwens arrest. A trap is set for Brill and Delacorte, who attempt to flee on a speedboat but are nabbed by the law.
