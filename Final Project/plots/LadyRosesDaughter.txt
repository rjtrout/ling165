As described in a film magazine, granddaughter and daughter of two matrimonial insurgents, Julie Le Breton (Ferguson) has a bar sinister heritage to perpetually battle. In the position of secretary to her haughty aunt of wealth and social position, Lady Henry (Waterman) she obtains a popularity distasteful to the latter, particularly as it includes the affections of Lord Delafield (Herbert). He persists in defiance of her wishes and in his love for Julie, who instead has given her heart to Captain Warkworth (Powell), unaware of his perfidy and an affair with a mutual friend, Aileen Moffet. Placed in a compromising situation in Warkworths apartments after fleeing from the slurs and unfair treatment of her aunt Lady Henry, Julie gains knowledge of his dishonorable ways and decides to end her life by poison. When she is taken to the hospital to recover her health, the police find Lord Delafields card in her possession. He comes to offer his faithful protection that ultimately wins her love after the death of Captain Warkworth.
