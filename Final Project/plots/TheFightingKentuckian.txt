John Breen, a Kentucky militiaman, falls in love with French exile Fleurette de Marchand (Vera Ralston). He discovers a plot to steal the land that Fleurettes exiles plan to settle on. Throughout the film, Breens soldiers sing: Only six hundred miles more to go Only six hundred miles more to go And if we can just get lucky We will end up in Kentucky Only six hundred miles more to go When the song is first heard, there are eight hundred miles to go (the tune is Shell Be Coming Round the Mountain).
