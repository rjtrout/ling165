The Stooges are incompetent and dim-witted repairmen fixing the doorbell of a large house, which, unbeknownst to them, is the secret headquarters of a group of Nazi agents, headed by the ruthless Hans (Vernon Dent). They manage to disembowel the wiring of the walls and destroy most of the house as they work, and then subdue the agents and sink their submarine by remote control. The boys are caught before the remote control falls, leading to an explosion. The stooges hit the heads of the enemies and make a door bell sound in the process.
