Griff Marat (Cornel Wilde), is a parole officer who falls in love with a parolee, Jenny Marsh (Patricia Knight). Marsh had gone to prison in order to protect Harry Wesson (John Baragrey) a gambler with whom she was having an affair. Warned to steer clear of Harry permanently, Jenny disobeys, still feeling loyal to him. A raid on Harrys bookie joint while Jenny is there costs her the job Griff has found for her. Out of concern for her welfare, Griff hires Jenny as a caretaker for his blind mother (Esther Minciotti). Griff has political ambitions that Harry would like to ruin, so Harry encourages Jenny to accept Griffs romantic advances. They get married after Jenny realises she loves Griff but the couple flee to Mexico one night after Harry is found shot after she tries to tell him of her love of Griff. Griff takes a job in an oil refinery, willing to do anything to keep Jenny from going back to jail. A photograph reveals their true identities, but upon their return, Harry swears that the shooting was an accident, clearing Jennys name.
