Goliath, the circus strongman (Nat Pendleton) and the midget, Little Professor Atom (Jerry Maren), are accomplices of bad guy John Carter (James Burke) who is trying to take over the Wilson Wonder Circus. Julie Randall (Florence Rice) performs a horse act in the circus. In the animal car on the circus train, Goliath and Atom knock out Julies boyfriend, Jeff Wilson (Kenny Baker), and steal $10,000, which Jeff owes Carter. Jeffs friend and circus employee, Tony (Chico), summons attorney J. Cheever Loophole (Groucho) to handle the situation. Loophole caves in when he sees the muscular Goliath, and gets nowhere with Little Professor Atom. In order to help Wilson, he first tries to get the hidden money from Carters moll, Peerless Pauline (Eve Arden), but fails. Tony and Punchy search Goliaths stateroom on the circus train for the money, but are unsuccessful. Loophole calls upon Jeffs wealthy aunt, Mrs. Dukesbury (Margaret Dumont), and tricks her into paying $10,000 for the Wilson Wonder Circus to entertain the Newport 400, instead of a performance by French conductor Jardinet (Fritz Feld), and his symphony orchestra. The audience is delighted with the circus; when Jardinet arrives, Loophole, who also delayed the Frenchman by implicating him in a dope ring, disposes of the conductor and his orchestra by having them play on a floating bandstand down at the waters edge. Tony and Punchy (Harpo) cut the mooring rope while the orchestra plays the Prelude to Act Three of Wagners Lohengrin, Meanwhile, Carter and his henchmen try to burn down the circus, but are thwarted by Loophole, Tony, and Punchy, along with the only witness to the robbery: Gibraltar the gorilla (Charles Gemora), who also retrieves Wilsons money.
