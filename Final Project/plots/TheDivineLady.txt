In the late eighteenth century, Lady Hamilton has had a somewhat turbulent relationship with the British people, especially the aristocracy. Born Emma Hart from a very humble background (she being the daughter of a cook), she was seen as being vulgar by the rich, but equally captivating for her beauty. In a move to protect his inheritance, Honorable Charles Greville, Emmas then lover and her mothers employer, sent Emma to Naples under false pretenses to live with his uncle, Sir William Hamilton, where she would study to become a lady. Surprisingly to Greville whose deception Emma would eventually discover, Emma ended up becoming Hamiltons wife in a marriage of convenience. But it is Emmas eventual relationship with Horatio Nelson of the British navy that would cause the largest issue. A move by Lady Hamilton helped Nelsons armada defeat Napoleons fleet in naval battles, which Nelson would have ultimately lost without Lady Hamiltons help. Beyond the dangers of war, Lady Hamilton and Nelsons relationship is ultimately threatened by the court of public opinion as both are married to other people.
