The childless wife of a small town doctor in North Carolina, tired of his spending too much time playing with his model trains and her empty life, meets a young British hitchhiker in a caf√©. She starts thinking he might be the baby she was made to give up for adoption when she was a schoolgirl of 15. In her fantasies, as the two start getting to know each other, she finds she has not only the child she has always missed but also a potentially virile lover. He for his part starts wanting to harm her husband, who in fact is planning to leave her for a nurse he loves.
