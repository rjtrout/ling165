Frances Halladay is a 27-year-old dancer who lives with her best friend Sophie in Brooklyn. When Sophie decides she wants to relocate to her dream neighborhood of Tribeca, Frances is unable to afford it and is forced to find someplace else to live. She moves to Chinatown and shares an apartment with her friends Lev and Benji for a brief period. She visits her hometown of Sacramento for Christmas where she sees her family and reconnects with high school friends. She spends an uneventful two-days in Paris that she pays for on a credit card. She returns to Vassar, her alma mater, to work as a waitress and summer RA, but finally returns to Washington Heights in Manhattan. Frances laments her lack of money, her poor prospects as a professional dancer, and her increasingly strained relationship with Sophie. She reconciles with Sophie and enjoys a modest but satisfying existence as a fledgling choreographer, teaching dance to young children, and bookkeeper for her former dance company, exploring a potential relationship with Benji, and living alone in her own apartment.
