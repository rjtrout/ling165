Expelled from other preparatory schools, most recently after causing a campus explosion, "Dink" Stover is given one last chance by his father to find maturity along with a proper education. On the way to a new academy, Dink promptly disrupts the trip of a fellow carriage passenger, Mr. Hopkins, by causing the horse to break into a gallop. He is unaware that Hopkins is his schools headmaster. Dink becomes acquainted with other students like Tough McCarty and Tennessee Shad and immediately begins getting into fights. The rivalry spills onto a football field and also includes cruel pranks played on a girl at school, Connie Brown. On the verge of being kicked out of yet another school, Dink comes to his senses just in time, making his father proud at last.
