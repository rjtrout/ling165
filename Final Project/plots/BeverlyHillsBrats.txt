Scooter (Billingsley) is a teen from a wealthy Beverly Hills family. After his plastic surgeon father (Sheen) remarries, Scooter is virtually ignored by his father and stepmother (Moore), and treated badly by his two other spoiled siblings, Sterling (Ramon Estevez) and Tiffany (Cathy Podewell). Scooter devises a plan to fake his own kidnapping to get his parents attention and enlists the help of two bumbling crooks, Clive (Young) and Elmo (Kirby). After Scooter is "kidnapped" and a ransom is demanded, he quickly realizes that his plan failed to work and his parents dont miss him.
