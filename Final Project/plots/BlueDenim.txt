The story is set in Dearborn, Michigan, during the 1950s, and revolves around fourteen-year-old Arthur Bartley (Brandon deWilde) and his schoolmates, fifteen-year-old Janet Willard (Carol Lynley) and Ernie (Warren Berlinger). While widowers-daughter Janet laughs at Arthur and Ernies forays into smoking, drinking, and playing cards, shes always been interested in Arthur, and as Arthurs parents try to shelter him from negative things in life (like the euthanasia of the family dog, done while hes at school), he turns to Janet for comfort. The relationship between Janet and Arthur results in her becoming pregnant. Unable to ask their parents (who misinterpret their pleas as "ordinary" teenage curiosity about sex and adulthood) for help, they turn to Ernie, whod boasted earlier about "helping a sailor who got his girl in trouble" by directing him to an abortionist – only to discover Ernie made it all up, based on secondhand stories. The three seek together to arrange an abortion and raise the funds, only to be discovered by their parents at the last moment. In the meantime, Arthur and Janet find out how much they do not yet know about life – and how much they truly care about each other.
