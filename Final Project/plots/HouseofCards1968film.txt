Reno Davis (George Peppard) is an American writer who has recently retired from boxing. Now unemployed and broke in France, he finds the wealthy widow of a French general. Anne de Villemont (Inger Stevens) is attracted to Renos stoicism and they become lovers. She also hires him to tutor her eight-year-old son Paul (Barnaby Shaw). Reno is led to believe Annes husband was killed in the Algerian conflict and is troubled by Annes intense fear that Paul will be kidnapped. He then discovers the family has ties to a fascist organization that plans to take over all of Europe. He takes on the shady psychiatrist Morillon (Keith Michell) and mysterious family friend Leschenhaut (Orson Welles), both of whom scare Anne whenever they are around. Reno is framed for his best friends murder as he and Anne become the targets of the ambitious and maniacal schemers who wish to rule the entire European continent. Reno and Anne are hunted and chased around France while protecting Paul from being abducted. The chase ends at the Coliseum in Rome, where Reno and the villains engage in a showdown.
