In the course of events, Vivienne faints, Porthen is killed by his secretary Joan (Helen Raymond), and Freddy runs away for fear that he will be blamed. Three years later, Vivienne travels to Transvaal to investigate some problem property she owns. She is rescued from bandits by homesteader Kerry Burgess (Robert Ellis) and the two fall in love. More intrigue brought about by Viviennes rejection of another suitor, Wolf Montague (Landers Stevens), leads to the sabotage of a dam and a destructive flood.
