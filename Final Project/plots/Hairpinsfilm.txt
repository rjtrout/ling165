As described in a film magazine, Rex Rossmore (Moore) disgust at the hairpin-strewing, straggly locks of his young bride Muriel (Bennett) and her concentration upon extra-particularness in her housekeeping make it easy for him to forsake her company outside the home for that of his stenographer Effie Wainwright (Livingston). Overhearing her husbands confession of her failure as a wife to him as he makes it to his employer, she considers suicide. Making herself orderly for death, she discovers that she is beautiful in life, and conceives a plan whereby she plays an affair of her own against that of her husband and stenographer, acquaints herself with the ways of the gay world and practices them until her husbands rage brings issue to their artificial existences. This reveals to the man that his love is to the woman herself, after all, and not to her fashionable habiliments. This readjustment is certain to reflect a compromise in several things after a reconciliation is brought about after the husband discovers that another man is in love with his wife.
