chairman john phelan said yesterday support letting federal regulators suspend program trading wild stock-price swings thus band-wagon psychology recent days picks new impetus index arbitrage is common form program trading usually practiced takes advantage rather basic concept separate markets different locations trading basically same widgets n't trade long prices are widely different index arbitrage widget is s&p price is constantly compared futures market chicago stock markets largely new york profit index-arbitrage opportunity someone owns s&p widget new york sell replace cheaper s&p widget chicago money manager performing service is being paid clients match beat return s&p index is likely remain fully invested times few index-fund managers risk leveraging performance owning more % exposure stocks equally few want own less % position stocks rise constantly seeking own cheapest widget index-arbitrage traders hope add % % annual return s&p represents very thin excess return certainly far less most fundamental stock pickers claim seek performance objective fact vast majority fundamentalist money managers fail beat s&p contribute hysteria surrounding issue more managers pursue index-arbitrage strategy small opportunities markets be reduced eventually eliminated current opportunities arise process executing buy sell order actual stocks make s&p is more cumbersome transacting futures market new york stock exchange attempt introduce new portfolio basket is evidence investors desires make fast easy transactions large numbers shares so index arbitrage is simply taking advantage thin inefficiencies markets same widget did program trading evolve evil creature is evoking curses so many observers arguments program trading even pressed fact conclude expected results reforms are implemented reduced volatility long-term investment focus level playing field small investor many reforms are unneeded even harmful reducing volatility index-arbitrage trade is never executed is sufficient difference markets new york chicago cover transaction costs arbitrage does n't cause volatility responds think causes difference prices markets s&p stocks usually is large investors initiating buy sell chicago large investor likely cause futures market decline sells futures arbitrage simply transfers selling pressure chicago new york functioning buyer chicago start whole process is key someone fundamentally increase decrease ownership widgets make widget prices move does large hypothetical seller trade chicago instead new york perhaps is willing sacrifice arbitrage trader small profit order get quick certain execution large trade competitive market investor has many ways execute transactions have more alternatives foreign domestic volume is profitable exchange handle not chicago then new york not u.s. then overseas volatility surrounding trades occurs not index arbitrage is large addition subtraction widget market finite liquidity eliminate arbitrage liquidity decline instead rising creating more volatility instead less speed transaction is n't be feared either faster cleaner execution is desirable not loathsome slowing things reduce volatility stone tablets become trade ticket future encouraging long-term investing be very cautious labeling investors long-term short-term policies designed encourage type investor are akin placing sign big board door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away ultimate goal investor is profit motive regulators not concern investors are sufficiently focused long term free market profit motive attract investor liquidity risks tolerate point fact volatility measured annualized standard deviation daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher is today periods advent futures program trading were often more volatile usually fundamental market conditions were undergoing change example is interesting see fundamental stock pickers scream foul program trading markets decline hailing great values still abounding markets rise rising volatility possibly be related uncertainty economics stocks instead evil deeds program-trading goblins proposed fixes is labeled program-trading volatility be far worse perceived problem using program trading whipping boy fundamentalist investors stand gain high ground wooing small investors existing stock-selection products however risk bringing damaging interference markets does nice new tax say % financial transaction sound make sure 're thinking long term getting level playing field argument is perhaps most interesting abolishing program trading not merits firms championing cause loudest reformers are money managers cater smaller investors continually advise clients individual stocks buy sell clients continue hope superior performance even mutual funds little investor continues tolerate high fees high commissions poor performance index-fund managers slowly amass better record lower fees lower commissions less risk efforts are somehow less noble investment expert studiously devouring press clippings company follows almost new regulation is introduced interests protecting little guy invariably is least able cope consequences spreads available index arbitrage are so enormous surely sizable mutual-fund company profit offering small investors sad reality is retail investor continues pursue stellar performers first leaving institutions grapple basis points performance large sums money quarter quarter cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough justify high fees commissions retail customers frequently pay institutional customers refuse pay new trading roadblock is likely be beaten institutions seeking better ways serve high-volume clients here overseas legislating new trading inefficiencies only make things harder least sophisticated investors so is next program trading left own devices index arbitrage become more more efficient making harder harder do profitably
