everything looked good neurosurgeon walter levy colleagues carefully cut away woman spinal tumor cleveland clinic using small electrical shocks applied feet were able monitor sensory nerves shocks generated nerve impulses traveled spine brain showed up clearly brain-wave monitor indicating damage delicate spinal tissue then says dr. levy woke up paralyzed damage was motor nerves n't be monitored sensory nerves explains tragedy adds galvanized look way prevent similar cases dr. levy answer come new kind magnetic brain probe device dozens u.s. researchers are studying great hope holding promise safer spinal surgery probe improve diagnosis brain nerve disorders such strokes multiple sclerosis perhaps most exciting device is thrusting window workings brain probe is painless non-invasive apparently harmless employs strong magnetic fields induce small whirlwinds electricity brain positioned brain motor-control area hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses zip motor nerves activate muscles making say finger twitch principle enable doctors check body motor system way electrician tests home electrical circuits running current now 've had objective way measuring motor function says keith chiappa neurologist conducting clinical tests devices boston massachusetts general hospital do was tell patient squeeze fingers as hard raise arm best circumstances such tests are subjective patient is unconscious do n't work magnetic brain tweaking started early 1900s researchers produced flashes light visual field magnets 1960s mayo clinic researchers developed magnetic devices stimulate motor nerves hand other limbs brain tests unwieldy machines have required patients stand heads says reginald bickford researcher university california san diego field took off scientists britain sheffield university developed handy compact magnet brain stimulation then least commercial versions have been put u.s. market estimated have been sold august chicago conference such devices attracted more researchers reported studies everything brain mapping physical therapy do n't feel use devices routinely surgery yet 're getting close says dr. levy is now university pittsburgh problem adds is anesthetized brains are more resistant magnetic stimulation awake ones devices help indicate surgery help says charles tator university toronto neurosurgeon example paralyzed car-crash victims occasionally have intact spinal tissues preserved emergency surgery enable partial recovery such operations typically are n't performed is sign right injury surgery be beneficial cost magnetic stimulators seem peanuts retrieve limb function such people dr. tator says scientists caution is chance magnet technique spark seizures epileptics significant problems have been reported hundreds people tested devices main sensation feeling puppet jerked invisible strings is rap head says sam bridgers neurologist has studied brain stimulators yale university apparent side effect is minor increase brain hormone doctors have conducted hours tests report temporary headaches least companies cadwell laboratories inc. kennewick wash. novametrix medical systems inc. wallingford conn. now sell versions magnetic devices machines are inexpensive medical standards have n't been approved u.s. marketing brain stimulators are sold stimulating nerves hand legs other non-brain areas researchers apply permission use probes brain studies university kentucky team led dean currier physical therapy researcher is testing stimulators conjunction electric shocks induce muscle contractions help prevent wasting thigh muscles knee surgery similarly purdue university team led heart researcher w.a. tacker hopes develop ways magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions devices someday serve temporary pacemakers restarters stopped hearts says dr. tacker prototype was dubbed tacker whacker devices most remarkable possibilities though involve brain probing stimulators national institutes health scientists recently showed brain reorganizes motor-control resources amputation similar studies are expected reveal stroke patients brains regroup first step finding ways bolster process speed rehabilitation scientists also are exploring memory perception new machines state university new york brooklyn researchers flash groups different letters computer screen front human guinea pigs flashes certain areas subjects brains are jolted magnetic stimulator jolt is timed just right subjects do n't recall seeing first group letters does first stimulus go exclaims suny neurologist paul maccabee trying answer is suggesting kinds theories such precisely brain processes incoming signals eyes others say machines are weak enough do n't jeopardize memory suny team researchers national magnet laboratory cambridge mass. are working more potent magnetic brain stimulators other things stronger devices be able summon forth half-forgotten memories induce mood changes neurologists say
