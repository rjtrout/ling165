tuesday rout gop congressional hopeful mississippi district has n't backed democratic presidential candidate adlai stevenson is reminder least federal level political ticket splitting has been rise past half century only presidential election year prior did more % nation congressional districts choose different party candidate white house house representatives now percentage routinely equals third twice has been % know voters tend favor republicans more races president congress presidential election past half century goldwater presidential candidacy gop has captured greater percentage major-party popular vote president has congressional seats popular vote congress prior pattern was nearly opposite accounts results recent decades simple economic theory provide least partial explanation split personality displayed americans voting booth theory relies assumptions voters buy brands select political agents republican brand believes minimalist state virtues private markets vices public action democratic brand believes big government public intervention remedy excesses attendant pursuit private interest congressional representatives have basic responsibilities voting office dealing national issues programmatic actions such casting roll call votes legislation imposes costs confers benefits population large attending local issues constituency service pork barrel republican congressional representatives belief minimalist state are less willing engage local benefit-seeking are democratic members congress assumptions hold voters races congress face economic theory is called prisoner dilemma have incentive margin lean democratic put republican office not only acquire less terms local benefits selected legislator be relatively powerless prevent other legislators bringing home bacon respective constituencies legislator is only comes national policy making races white house voter incentive margin is lean republican gop president limit local benefits voter particular such president is also likely be more effective preventing other legislators bringing home local benefits individual voter 's standing consequently be enhanced lower taxes theory is exceedingly simple appears explain several things first ticket splitting has increased taken peculiar pattern has past half century prior election franklin roosevelt president advent new deal government occupied much smaller role society prisoner dilemma problem confronting voters races congress was considerably less severe second explains voters hold congress disdain generally love own congressional representatives individual legislator constituents appreciate specific benefits legislator wins not overall cost associated other legislator doing likewise own constituency third theory suggests legislators pay too much attention national policy making relative local benefit-seeking have lower security office example first-term members house once most vulnerable incumbents have become virtually immune defeat exception recent trend was defeat freshman republicans brought office reagan revolution running re-election freshmen placed far more emphasis partisan role spreading reagan revolution national policy making were more vulnerable defeat fourth theory indicates republican party have difficult time attracting viable candidates congressional office potential candidates be discouraged running less congressional salary prospect defeat hands democratic opponent extent potential republican candidates financial backers realize congressional prisoner dilemma game works disadvantage republican party be hindered attempts field competitive slate congressional candidates fifth theory provide least partial reason ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced south extent democratic legislators south have held disproportionate share power congress have been able translate such clout relatively more local benefits respective constituencies voters south have had especially strong incentive keep such democrats office finally theory suggests republicans generally have fared better senate races campaigns house local benefit-seeking matters more national policy making matters less lower chamber congress is precisely pattern expect republicans are less willing engage local benefit-seeking democratic counterparts is empirical support theory pieces evidence corroborate key assumption democratic legislators are more willing engage local benefit-seeking republican colleagues first economists james bennett thomas dilorenzo find gop senators turn back roughly % more allocated personal staff budgets democrats do extent primary duty personal staff involves local benefit-seeking indicates political philosophy leads congressional republicans pay less attention narrow constituent concerns second key assumption is valid democrats have lower attendance rates roll-call votes republicans do extent such votes reflect national policy making participating such votes takes away time legislator otherwise devote local benefit-seeking is indeed data indicate particularly case house democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded republican house attendance rate finally shown table democrats allocate higher proportion personal staffs district offices local benefit-seeking duties matter more national policy making activities matter less relative washington offices examination changes personal staffing decisions senate control body changed party hands moreover reveals personal staffing differences noted table not be attributed disproportionate control democrats exercise due majority-party status other resources such committee staff additional piece evidence senate holding other factors constant such incumbency advantages regional factors difference popular votes republican presidential senatorial candidates states conducting senate election turns be positive function onerous federal government tax burden is state progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder put more simply gop candidates president are looked more kindly voters republican candidates senate prisoner dilemma is more severe moreover ticket splitting appears take same peculiar pattern state government level does federal level state government is more typically split lines reverse cross-state econometric investigation furthermore reveals holding other factors constant difference state major-party vote going republican gubernatorial candidate republican share lower state house is positive function state tax rate sum federal state government levels least part seemingly irrational behavior voters display voting booth have exceedingly rational explanation mr. zupan teaches university southern california business school
