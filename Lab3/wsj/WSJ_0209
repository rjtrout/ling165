researchers plant genetic systems n.v. belgium said have developed genetic engineering technique creating hybrid plants number key crops researchers said have isolated plant gene prevents production pollen gene thus prevent plant fertilizing such so-called male-sterile plants then be fertilized pollen strain plant thereby producing hybrid seed new generation plants possess flourishing high-production trait known hybrid vigor similar now seen hybrid corn development have dramatic effect farm production especially cotton said murray robinson president delta pine land co. southwide inc. subsidiary is largest cotton seed producers u.s commercial scale sterilization pollen-producing male part has only been achieved corn sorghum feed grains 's male part tassel female ear are distance apart corn plant labor-intensive process seed companies cut tassels plant making male sterile sow row male-fertile plants nearby then pollinate male-sterile plants first hybrid corn seeds produced using mechanical approach were introduced 1930s yielded as much % more corn naturally pollinated plants vast majority u.s. corn crop now is grown hybrid seeds produced seed companies similar technique is almost impossible apply other crops such cotton soybeans rice male part anthers plant female pistils same plant are fraction inch even attached other anthers plants are difficult clip china great number workers are engaged pulling male organs rice plants using tweezers one-third rice produced country is grown hybrid seeds plant genetic systems researchers have isolated pollen-inhibiting gene be inserted plant confer male sterility jan leemans research director said gene was successfully introduced oil-producing rapeseed plants major crop europe canada using carrier promoter gene developed robert goldberg university california los angeles sterilizing gene is expressed just pollen is develop deactivates anthers flower plant mr. leemans said genetic manipulation does n't hurt growth plant researchers also pulled second genetic engineering trick order get male-sterile plants large enough numbers produce commercial hybrid seed crop attached second gene herbicide resistance pollen-inhibiting gene genes are then inserted few greenhouse plants are then pollinated allowed mature produce seed laws heredity dictate half plants springing greenhouse-produced seeds be male sterile herbicide resistant half be male fertile herbicide susceptible application herbicide kill male-fertile plants leaving large field male-sterile plants be cross-pollinated produce hybrid seed mr. leemans said hybrid rapeseeds created genetic engineering yield % % more output commercial strains used currently technique is applicable wide variety crops said added modifications be necessary accommodate peculiarities type crop said company is experimenting technique alfalfa plans include cotton corn other crops said even virtually corn seeds currently planted are hybrids genetic approach obviate need mechanical emasculation anthers costs u.s. seed producers annually recent years demand hybrid seeds has spurred research number chemical biotechnology companies including monsanto co. shell oil co. eli lilly co technique developed companies involves chemical spray supposed kill only plant pollen have been problems chemical sprays damaging plants female reproductive organs concern toxicity such chemical sprays humans animals beneficial insects however paul johanson monsanto director plant sciences said company chemical spray overcomes problems is gentle female organ biosource genetics corp. vacaville calif. is developing spray containing gene spreads cell cell interferes genes are responsible producing pollen gene called gametocide is carried plant virus remains active few days robert erwin president biosource called plant genetic approach interesting novel complementary rather competitive is large market there hungry hybrid seeds said mr. robinson delta pine seed producer scott miss. said plant genetic success creating genetically engineered male steriles does n't automatically mean be simple create hybrids crops 's because pollination easy corn carrier is wind is more complex involves insects carriers crops such cotton 's thing say sterilize then successfully pollinate plant said nevertheless said is negotiating plant genetic acquire technology try breeding hybrid cotton
