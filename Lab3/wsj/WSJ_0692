defense intellectuals have complained years pentagon not determine priorities has strategy last april new defense secretary richard cheney acknowledged given ideal world have nice neat orderly process do strategy then come around do budget city does n't work way five-year defense plan costing more 's about time put together defense strategy works washington n't happen strategists come ivory tower learn work real world limited budgets uncertain futures is identify national goals threats goals shape strategy counter threats determine forces needed execute strategy finally forging budgets needed build maintain forces procedures consume millions man-hours labor produce tons paper year end product year defense plan promptly melts away graph left shows happens see accompanying illustration wsj oct. compare past five-year plans actual appropriations pentagon strategists produce budgets simply not be executed assume defense strategy depends only goals threats strategy however is possibilities not hopes dreams ignoring costs u.s. strategists abdicate responsibility hard decisions puts real strategic decisions hands others bean counters budgeteers pork-barrelers people have different agendas result recent vote house undo mr. cheney program terminations suggests preservation jobs is becoming real goal defense strategy turn situation around reform starts pentagon strategists consider impact budget uncertainties beginning planning process examine range optimistic pessimistic budget scenarios change defense program then develop priorities identifying least painful program cuts moved higher lower budgets also identify best way add programs budget come higher levels kind contingency analysis is common war planning business planning is reason not be done defense planning steps are necessary translate idea action step cleans books five-year plan contains accounting devices negative money above guidance management reserve optimistic inflation estimates understate spending pentagon has committed almost negative money was invented make year defense plan conform numbers president reagan final budget submission congress plan exceeded numbers contained budget message make books balance is required law somebody invented new budget line item simply subtracted is known pentagon negative wedge pentagon argues negative wedge is net effect as-yet unidentified procurement reductions intends find future years above guidance management reserve accounts undefined programs materialize future plan also assumes inflation decline % most forecasters including congressional budget office assume inflation be excess % years rate defense plan is underfunded adding negative wedge recalculating remaining program using more probable inflation estimate arrive baseline program costing step examines progressively lower budget scenarios change baseline changes affect national security graph right assumes % rate inflation places scenarios context recent appropriations see accompanying illustration wsj oct. note baseline program assumes sharp increase future appropriations step answer question happens increases do not materialize scenario known constant dollar freeze reimburses pentagon inflation only slopes upward % year scenario has been rough position u.s. senate reduces baseline scenario current dollar freeze has been approximate position house representatives about years freezes budget current level forces pentagon eat effects inflation reduces baseline scenario extends recent compromises house senate splits difference scenarios increasing budget % year reduces baseline finally scenario reduces budget % year next years total reduction be thought pessimistic prediction perhaps driven sequestering effects gramm-rudman deficit reduction law possibly relaxation tensions soviet union strategic planners joint chiefs staff construct most effective defense program scenario maximizing strengths minimizing weaknesses conclude efforts producing comprehensive net assessment plan including assumptions made analysis deficiencies limitations impact national security best strategy working limitations exercise reveal true cost particular program forcing strategists make hard decisions example choose keep b-2 stealth bomber have sacrifice more more other programs such carrier battlegroups army divisions moved lower budget levels trade-offs evolve priorities revealing cost b-2 became prohibitive be tempted argue idea strategic review merely resurrects infamous zero-based budgeting zbb concept carter administration zbb did not involve strategic planners joint chiefs staff therefore degenerated bean-counting drill driven budget politics anyway zbb procedures were so cumbersome everyone involved was crushed burden marginalia strategic review is fundamentally different be run joint chiefs simple directions produce best possible force budget scenario provide secretary defense comprehensive net assessment force be used achieve u.s. goals be feared even thinking lower budgets hurt national security door be opened opportunistic budget cutting irresponsible congress argument plays well atmosphere gaming mistrust permeating pentagon congress unfortunately is truth end be rejected logical as well moral reasons say pentagon act irresponsibly acting responsibly provoke congress acting irresponsibly leads conclusion pentagon deliberately exaggerate needs national interest other words is justified committing crime lying congress is morally superior strategy is not game pentagon congress is art possible world constraints force choose unpleasant imperfect alternatives want meaningful priorities understand trade-offs imply make commitments strategy is not separate event idealized sequence discrete events is way thinking neutralizes threats interests manner consistent financial cultural physical limitations mr. spinney is permanent pentagon official is condensed version essay appear january
