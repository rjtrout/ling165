intel corp. most powerful computer chip has flaws delay several computer makers marketing efforts bugs are n't expected hurt intel most computer makers computer experts familiar flaws found intel chip say defects do n't affect average user are likely be cleared up most computers using chip brains appear market sometime next year intel said last week customer discovered flaws microprocessor chip floating-point unit set circuits do certain calculations friday intel began notifying customers bugs cause chip give wrong answers mathematical calculations international business machines corp. compaq computer corp. say bugs delay products most big computer makers said flaws do n't affect bugs are just normal part product development said richard archuleta director hewlett-packard co. advanced systems development hewlett announced last week planned ship computer based chip early next year bugs do n't affect schedule said likewise ast research inc. sun microsystems inc. said bugs n't delay development 486-based machines have n't modified schedules way said sun spokesman switch vendor chips definitely not be option said nonetheless concern chip have been responsible decline cents intel stock share yesterday over-the-counter trading volume shares partly responsible drop compaq stock new york stock exchange composite trading wednesday yesterday compaq plunged further closing share off share volume shares most compaq decline is being attributed third-quarter earnings report came in low end analysts expectations intel said had corrected problems start producing bugless chips week not be seeing more said bill rash intel director chip 's more bugs only emerge esoteric applications such computer-aided design scientific calculations said then very seldom errata do not affect business programs said bugs cause problems specific rare circumstances not occur typical applications such word-processing spreadsheets said michael slater editor microprocessor report industry newsletter sun hewlett-packard others say intel is n't wholly blame snafu real culprits said are computer makers such ibm have jumped gun unveil 486-based products reason is getting so much visibility is started shipping announced early availability said hewlett-packard mr. archuleta do 're taking risk companies are paying price taking risk late september ibm began shipping plug-in card converts model machine machine ibm spokeswoman said company told customers monday bugs temporarily stopped shipping product ibm has plans recall add-on cards spokeswoman said probably circumvent bugs long product delays do n't look major problem said compaq said discovered bugs still plans announce new products nov. glitch however company said does n't know machine be commercially available 's break compaq tradition company does n't announce products 're actually dealers problem is being ballyhooed experts say is intel future flagship intel microprocessors are chips choice many today personal computers microprocessor is spearhead company bid guard spot next generation machines sorts bugs are not all uncommon is extremely high-profile product said mr. slater newsletter editor intel chip is corvette intel microprocessors super-fast super-expensive chip only most power-hungry computer users are likely buy least several years unveiled last april chip crams transistors sliver silicon more as many intel earlier model intel clocks chip speed instructions second mips 's as fast machines using are expected challenge higher-priced work stations minicomputers applications such so-called servers connect groups computers together computer-aided design chip speed processing power is dazzling real strength lies software inheritance is descendant long series intel chips began dominating market ever ibm picked 16-bit chip first personal computer 16-bit microprocessor processes pieces data time is slower newer 32-bit chips then intel has cornered large part market successive generations 16-bit 32-bit chips run software written previous models 's keep computer makers coming spite irritation bugs big personal computer makers many makers engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines are expected reach market early next year big computer makers only apple computer co. bases machines motorola chips instead is going have big impact industry said hewlett-packard mr. archuleta 's going be leading edge technology personal computers next few years bug is not going have affect andy zipser dallas contributed article
