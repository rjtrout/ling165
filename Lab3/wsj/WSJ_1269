remember bulky thick-walled refrigerators years least something less efficient today thin-walled units soon be making comeback something is add as much so consumers now pay lower-priced refrigerators other expensive changes products ranging auto air conditioners foam cushioning commercial solvents are prospect something called montreal protocol signed nations most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts date involving products annual value u.s. alone signatories agreed curtail sharply use chlorofluorocarbons cfcs world-wide production be cut u.s. senate liked treaty so well ratified vote not be outdone george bush wants cfcs banished altogether year goal endorsed 80-nation u.n. environmental meeting helsinki spring 's lot banishment turns cfcs are primary ingredient gas often referred du pont trade name freon is compressed liquid form serve cooling agent refrigeration air-conditioning equipment gases containing cfcs are pumped polyurethane make foam used pillows upholstery insulation polyurethane foam is highly efficient insulator accounts walls refrigerators freezers be thinner now were back days were insulated glass fiber even estimates cost world as much now year convert other coolants foaming agents solvents redesign equipment less efficient substitutes montreal protocol legions supporters say is worth insist cfcs are damaging earth stratospheric ozone layer screens sun ultraviolet rays hence see something is n't done earthlings become ever more subject sunburn skin cancer peter teagan specialist heat transfer is running project arthur d. little inc. cambridge mass. find alternative technologies allow industry eliminate cfcs addition interest ozone depletion has extensively studied related topic global warming theory mankind generation carbon dioxide increased combustion fossil fuels is creating greenhouse effect work important climatic changes earth atmosphere time be first admit is not complete consensus scientific community problems says mr. teagan kind literature read come countervailing opinions quite frequently nature problem is such many others feel has be addressed soon evidence is n't afford wait does have be so soon atmospheric scientists think even cfcs were released atmosphere accelerating rate amount ozone depletion be only % middle next century 's easy get something comparable simply moving higher altitude u.s moreover are questions particularly atmospheric scientists know subject best ability anyone know fact is happening ozone layer is generally agreed cfcs rise earth stratosphere chlorine is capable interfering process ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules form ozone ozone creation is very large-scale natural process importance human-generated cfcs reducing is largely matter conjecture ozone layer is constantly motion thus very hard measure scientists have known late is is hole layer antarctica expands contracts year year is least worthy note are very few refrigerators antarctica moreover surely someone has noticed household refrigerators are closed systems running many years cfc gas insulation ever escaping argument environmentalists is substitutes are available not use mr. teagan cites list substitutes none so far match nonflammable nontoxic cfcs butane propane be used coolants example are flammable moreover new lubricants be needed protect compressors new formulations cfcs are solvents mr. teagan points as well equipment designed get cfcs is less efficient current devices energy consumption rise worsen greenhouse effect folks midwest just suffered mid-october snowstorm wonder greenhouse was needed let not be flippant grave risks happens arthur d. little is not interested throwing cold water ozone depletion global warming theories is interested making money advising industry convert world cfcs is big money environmentalism maybe ask was du pont so quickly capitulated issued statement giving wide publicity was withdrawing cfcs freon introduced revolutionized america making refrigeration air conditioning practical answer is big companies are growing weary fighting environmental movements are trying instead cash never care put quite way du pont happens has potential substitute cfcs imperial chemical industries u.k. also has is building plant louisiana produce japanese chemical companies are work developing own substitutes hoping conquer new markets course are still others do n't mind seeing new crises arise environmental groups soon go business were not able send mailings describing latest threat asking money fight university professors consultants scientific credentials saw huge market services evaporate price decontrol destroyed energy crisis thus demand alternative energy needed new crises generate new grants contracts other words environmentalism has created whole set vested interests fare better are many problems are few tends tilt public debate solutions even most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical seriousness threats insistence urgency is element make-work involved consumers pay bill price refrigerator air-conditioned car were really getting insurance environmental disaster price be cheap is impending threat get be very expensive
