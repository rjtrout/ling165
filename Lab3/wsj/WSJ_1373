chip memory is here today here tomorrow companies plan market new chip ceramic circuits store data even power is off today most widely used data-storing chips have volatile memories data disappear are n't fed steady diet electricity need external power supplies national semiconductor corp. start-up named ramtron corp. plan start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories remember data least years current flowing chips use materials such lead zirconate titanate form microscopic switches retain data electricity developers caution broad applications are several years away technology is n't fully refined ramtron colorado springs colo. plans start shipping commercial quantities simple ferroelectric chips december company expects chips eventually be used devices mimic whole range computer memory equipment including floppy-disk hard-disk drives national semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology krysalis corp. albuquerque n.m national says agreed acquire krysalis assets start shipping commercial quantities first chips including 4-kilobit memory next year production hurdles are overcome chips take significant part market addition not needing outside power source are potentially cheaper make require fewer manufacturing steps conventional chips military buyers have shown interest national says ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation today non-volatile chips such electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips n't be used computer central memory learn data slowly ferroelectric chips accept data very high speeds showing court being there austin texas company plans make easy show court miles away leaving town witnesses often travel long distances give face-to-face depositions lawyers court reporters means huge travel bills telephone videotape depositions just do n't match physical encounters change thanks lower long-distance rates cheaper electronics video telecom corp. markets videoconferencing systems is working court reporters wire nationwide network allow depositions live television company installed prototype system connects dallas miami digital phone lines is preparing set shop chicago new york other cities court-reporting agencies tie conference rooms network lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before formal network court reporters make things easier cheaper attorney be able use network hourly fee depending quality picture take depositions witnesses connected cities japanese reverse tack patent protection japan misuse u.s. patents has been sore point american chip makers now least japanese company is turning courtroom tables now most japanese charges have been responses suits last year hitachi ltd. surprised japan electronics industry accused korea samsung electronics co. using hitachi technology make dynamic random-access memory chips settlement was reached was n't made public hitachi went offensive u.s. motorola inc. earlier month suit charging motorola new mc88200 chip infringes hitachi patent recent hitachi suit accuses motorola reverse engineering hitachi technology turnabout nation champion reverse engineers moves illustrate more aggressive attitude patent protection patent experts say japan is starting take hitachi made reverse-engineering charges amendment counterclaim filed federal district court texas motorola sued hitachi patent violation hitachi charges motorola has engaged fraudulent inequitable conduct procurement certain motorola patents used motorola mc68030 microprocessor chip translation motorola appears have taken hitachi technology is patented u.s. hitachi says tried make look new technology motorola denied n't comment various charges odds ends computer chips simulate human vision have been developed japan sharp corp mimic brain looking image extracting fundamentals boundaries corners lines translating computer data sharp says set chips improve fax machines graphics computers identification systems recognize facial features n.v philips unit has created computer system processes video images times faster conventional systems using reduced instruction-set computing risc chips made intergraph huntsville ala. system splits image sees digital representations processed chip
