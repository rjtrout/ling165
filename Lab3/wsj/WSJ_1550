list laboratories claiming be producing inexplicable amounts heat cold fusion experiments is slowly growing experiments continue be plagued lack firm evidence extra heat is coming fusing hydrogen atoms new experiments big national laboratories are still unable find hints nuclear fusion reactions leaving only finding tritium texas experiment support university utah chemists claim achieving hydrogen fusion room temperatures latest developments cold fusion research were presented reports delivered fall meeting here electrochemical society first scientific meeting months hear formal reports cold fusion experiments meeting offered stark evidence dramatic fall scientific interest cold fusion research chemists registered society weeklong meeting fewer sat day half cold fusion presentations week end was contrast society meeting last may height controversy more scientists scores reporters tv crews crowded los angeles hotel ballroom tumultuous special night session subject chemists utah experiments triggered cold fusion uproar martin fleischmann b. stanley pons were meeting members expert committee set department energy evaluate cold fusion research were audience committee is recommend end month doe support cold fusion research most dozen scientists taking podium reported results new more sophisticated variations seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last march messrs. fleischmann pons experiments involve encircling thin rod palladium metal wire platinum plunging electrodes heavy water hydrogen atoms are doubly heavy form known deuterium electric current is applied palladium platinum electrodes heavy water did begin break dissociate ordinarily electrolysis breakup water consume almost electrical energy messrs. fleischmann pons said experiments also produced large amounts heat heat energy energy consumed breakup water molecules added far more energy coming apparatus electrical energy going reported also detected tritium indications nuclear radiation asserted excess heat energy be coming energy released nuclear fusion deuterium atoms palladium rod last weekend dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat similar electrolytic experiments amounts such heat vary widely reports presented here excess heat production was given richard a. oriani professor chemical engineering university minnesota mr. oriani said skepticism utah claims was initially confirmed first experiments last spring failed produce results then borrowed palladium rod chemists texas a&m said were getting excess heat results were fascinating said fourth run borrowed rod experiment began producing excess heat experiment was stopped briefly change instrument was restarted heat output really took produced excess heat several hours dying said typical other experiments mr. oriani said experiment was very erratic go doing nothing dissociating heavy water then totally unpredictable times begin producing excess heat as long hours before quieting excess heat was % % more energy involved electrolysis water mr. oriani said heat bursts were too large too long be explained sudden release energy have slowly accumulated experiments quiescent times scientists have suggested is reality excess energy said other scientists said also were getting sporadic bursts excess heat lasting several hours time bursts often occur said after perturbed experiments raising lowering amount electric current being applied switching current chemist privately suggested hinted anomalous chemical reactions be producing heat reason questions surround heat experiments is involve unusually meticulous measurements typically input energy ranges third watt watt excess energy is measured tenths watt exception is continuing experiment stanford university as much watts energy are being put electrolytic cells cell filled heavy water is producing watts more heat identical electrolytic cell filled ordinary water next reported turgut m. gur associate materials scientist robert a. huggins head stanford experimental team few hints excess heat be produced fusion came brief remarks chemist john bockris texas a&m university mr. bockris previously reported getting bursts excess heat detecting increasing amounts tritium forming heavy water said past few days 's gotten evidence is weak correlation time heat bursts occur production tritium is n't way continuously measure amount tritium heavy water 's been difficult tell tritium formation is related heat bursts other phenomenon increasingly careful attempts measure neutrons be strong evidence fusion reactions continue be negative messrs. fleischmann pons initially reported indirect evidence neutrons being produced experiment later conceded measurements were questionable researchers sandia national laboratories albuquerque n.m. reported went so far take cold fusion experiment neutron detectors tunnel feet granite shield detectors cosmic rays number times detected neutrons sometimes detectors only once hours experiment did detect neutron burst detectors think was spurious event shimson gottesfeld los alamos national laboratory said researchers there detected burst neutrons early cold fusion experiment last april decided not announce confirm subsequent experiments neutron detectors occasionally indicated burst neutrons neutron bursts were never recorded detectors same time concluded indications neutrons stemmed faults detectors rather cold fusion experiment lawrence berkeley laboratory california new experiments indicated lithium added heavy water conduct current produce previously unsuspected electrical effects surface palladium rod messrs. fleischmann pons have misinterpreted reported philip ross california laboratory
