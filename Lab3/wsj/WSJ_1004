international business machines corp. said agreed let motorola inc. participate semiconductor research project part effort bolster u.s. semiconductor industry ibm made announcement dedication research center here said invited many other companies participate well including europe jack kuehler ibm president said ibm is also considering letting other companies participate additional semiconductor work declined be more specific ibm said year ago was inviting companies participate semiconductor work has become far more open technology has tried rally u.s. industry head japanese now dominate market dynamic random access memory chips ibm armonk n.y. makes bulk drams uses does n't make equipment needed produce chips ibm worries japanese take equipment market too u.s. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here keep u.s. equipment makers healthy failure u.s. equipment makers ibm fears leave dependent many japanese companies compete other parts market ibm also said expects benefit expertise motorola other companies bring bear difficult problems involved semiconductor manufacturing ibm already participates industrywide effort improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques ibm said expects industrywide efforts become prevalent semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive state-of-the-art plant cost mid-1970s costs today technology is so complex ibm said expects costs continue climbing ibm said motorola is paying just nominal fee cover 21-month agreement acknowledged companies had turned invitation join in said was mainly project not bear fruit mid-1990s ibm said thought more companies become interested project progresses project involving motorola concerns technique called x-ray lithography figures be crucial future generations memory chips currently chips are produced shining light mask produce image chip much camera produces image film details chips now be extraordinarily fine wavelengths even ultraviolet light are long enough images draw be too blurry much someone using wide paintbrush produce broad line have trouble painting thin one x-rays contrast travel straighter be focused more tightly light x-rays have problems too make masks brittle pass material 're not supposed assuming problems be overcome allow memory chips approach bits information times as much is contained four-megabit chips are just reaching market times was possible mid-1970s
