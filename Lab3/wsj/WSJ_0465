medical scientists are starting uncover handful genes damaged unleash chaotic growth cells characterizes cancer scientists say discovery genes recent months is painting new startling picture cancer develops emerging understanding genes is expected produce array new strategies future cancer treatment prevention is future already scientists are developing tests based newly identified genes first time predict otherwise healthy individual is likely get cancer 's super-exciting set discoveries says bert vogelstein johns hopkins university researcher has just found gene pivotal triggering colon cancer only decade ago cancer was black box knew nothing molecular level today know accumulation several altered genes initiate cancer then propel deadly state scientists call new class genes tumor-suppressors simply anti-cancer genes functioning normally make proteins hold cell growth check genes are damaged perhaps radiation chemical chance accident cell division growth-suppressing proteins longer work cells normally control turn malignant newly identified genes differ family genes discovered early called oncogenes oncogenes be present cell become malignant researchers have found normal as well cancerous cells suggesting oncogenes do n't cause cancer recent months researchers have come believe types cancer genes work concert oncogene turn proliferating cells malignant only after tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged genes tumor-suppressor genes are inherited copies parent copy make proteins needed control cell growth so cancer arise copies be impaired person is born defective copy suppressor gene copy is damaged early life is especially prone cancer only lose other copy cancer develop emerging genetic tests be able spot such cancer-susceptible individuals ushering scientists believe is new age predictive cancer diagnosis bill bonnie quinlan are first beneficiaries new findings dedham mass. couple knew even before bonnie became pregnant child theirs had % chance being risk retinoblastoma eye cancer occurs about once births mr. quinlan years old knew carried damaged gene having lost eye rare tumor was only months old mother had suffered same fate was baby isolation retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene became possible last january find threat quinlan baby faced test using new genetic probes showed little will quinlan had not inherited damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene therefore faced more risk other children developing rare cancer made new year says mr. quinlan test was first predict reliably individual expect develop cancer equally important initial discovery gene controls retinal cell growth made boston doctor named thaddeus dryja has opened field cancer study recent months has exploded turns studying tragic uncommon tumor made possible fundamental insights most basic workings cancer says samuel broder director national cancer institute not be obvious public is concerned advances treatment am convinced basic research begin showing results there soon date scientists have fingered cancer-suppressors dr. dryja made retinoblastoma discovery then last spring researchers reported finding gene called impaired turns healthy colon cells cancerous soon report other research teams uncovered evidence same damaged p53 gene is present tissue lung breast cancers colon lung breast cancers are most common lethal forms disease collectively killing almost americans year right now about dozen laboratories u.s. canada britain are racing unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes have about candidates researchers say inactivation tumor-suppressor genes alone combination appears crucial development such scourges cancer brain skin kidney prostate cervix is evidence people inherit defective versions genes are especially prone cancer perhaps explaining finally cancers seem haunt certain families story tumor-suppressor genes goes back 1970s pediatrician named alfred g. knudson jr. proposed retinoblastoma stemmed separate genetic defects theorized eye cancer infant inherited damaged copy gene parent normal copy other tumor suggested developed second normal copy also was damaged was way prove dr. knudson two-hit theory back then scientists had way ferreting specific genes microscope see pairs chromosomes cells contain genes occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible dr. knudson found children eye cancer had inherited damaged copy chromosome no. parent had had disease microscope actually see bit chromosome was missing assumed missing piece contained gene genes loss had critical role setting cancer did n't know gene genes had disappeared then scientific team led molecular geneticist webster cavenee then university utah found answer team used battery newly developed gene probes snippets genetic material track gene presence cell analyzing cells extracted eye tumors found defects second copy chromosome exact area first copy chromosome finding riveted medicine was first time anyone had showed loss copies same gene lead eruption cancer was extraordinarily satisfying says dr. knudson now fox chase cancer research center philadelphia was convinced was true retinoblastoma be true cancers was audacious claim baltimore dr. vogelstein young molecular biologist johns hopkins medical school believed dr. knudson was right set repeat cavenee experiment cells other cancers was research teams report dual chromosome losses rare childhood cancer kidney called wilm tumor dr. vogelstein next turned attention colon cancer second biggest cancer killer u.s. lung cancer believed colon cancer also arise multiple hits cancer suppressor genes often seems develop stages often is preceded development polyps bowel cases become increasingly malignant identifiable stages progressing less severe deadly cascade genetic damage be occurring dr. vogelstein doctoral student eric fearon began months tedious often frustrating probing chromosomes searching signs genetic damage began uncovering confusing variety genetic deletions existing only benign polyps others malignant cells many polyps malignant cells gradually coherent picture cancer development emerged copies certain gene were knocked benign polyps develop copies second gene were then deleted polyps progress malignancy was clear more gene had be damaged colon cancer develop report galvanized other molecular biologists was confirming evidence needed gene losses were critical development common tumor says ray white howard hughes medical institute salt lake city dr. vogelstein had yet nail identity gene damaged flipped colon cell full-blown malignancy focused chromosome months johns hopkins researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down length chromosome looking smallest common bit genetic material lost tumor cells such piece dna probably constitute gene found last winter dr. vogelstein was dubious search was over doubts stemmed fact several years earlier princeton university researcher arnold levine had found experiments mice gene called p53 transform normal cells cancerous ones deletion dr. vogelstein found was exactly same spot p53 mr. levine had said p53 gene caused cancer promoting growth johns hopkins scientists were looking gene suppressed growth johns hopkins scientists compared gene had found human cancer cells mr. levine p53 gene found were identical turned mr. levine cancer studies had unknowingly been observing damaged form p53 cancer-suppressing gene discovery suddenly puts obscure gene right cockpit cancer formation says robert weinberg leader cancer-gene research whitehead institute cambridge mass evidence now is emerging p53 suppressor gene is involved other cancers too researchers edinburgh scotland have found breast tumors copy chromosome was mutated spot gene p53 lies scientists say breast cancer often strikes multiple members certain families gene inherited damaged form predispose women cancer p53 gene has just been implicated lung cancer report last week john minna colleagues national cancer institute say about cells taken lung cancer tissue tested are missing gene also are reports several labs as yet unpublished missing p53 genes tissue taken kidney brain skin cancers same time johns hopkins team others are rushing pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes dr. vogelstein hopes soon isolate chromosome also involved colon cancer ray white utah walter bodmer researcher great britain are close finding gene involved types colon cancer thought be chromosome dr. minna believes people inherit defective gene somewhere copies chromosome are especially prone lung cancer recently others reported retinoblastoma suppressor gene also be involved lung cancers as well several other more common cancers too discoveries lead scientists only speculate already major pharmaceutical companies squibb unit bristol-myers squibb co. hoffmann-la roche inc. are collaborating gene hunters turn anticipated cascade discoveries predictive tests maybe new therapies researchers say new cancer drugs slow reverse tumor growth be based suppressor proteins normally produced genes idea be administer patients growth-controlling proteins made healthy versions damaged genes even be possible replace defective genes healthy versions has come close doing so far case says dr. minna national cancer institute 're witnessing discovery most important steps genesis cancer
